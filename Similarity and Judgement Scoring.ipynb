      "                    \"text\": \"Gardner, Presiding Judge.\\nThis court has, on innumerable occasions, held that where an employee is injured in the scope of his employment and the evidence before the State Board of Workmen\\u2019s Compensation reflects that such was the case, an appellate court will not reverse such finding upon appeal through the proper channels.\\nCounsel for the employer contends that this case should fall within that line of cases which holds that, if an employee is upon a completely personal errand at the time of an injury or death, the employer is not liable for the results of such injury or death. Counsel for the employer cites a number of cases supporting this contention. We thoroughly agree that this is a true statement of the law, but we cannot agree that that line of cases is authority in the case at bar. Here there is ample evidence that the deceased and his partner were upon the employer\\u2019s business at the time of the injury which resulted in the death of the deceased. The case at bar is different from that line of cases where a definite lunch period is set aside for employes, during which time they are free to go where they please and do what they please, subject to no orders from their employers. The evidence in the instant case shows that the deceased and his partner would frequently buy sandwiches and one would drive while the other one ate. There is sufficient evidence here to show that the deceased did not deviate from the duties of his employment but as a matter of fact he had left the restaurant and was walking toward the courthouse to turn in papers upon which processes had been served, when he was hit. Certainly it cannot be considered that the deceased was not within the course of his employment and was not acting within the scope of his employment at the time he was hit by a car in the street immediately adjoining the courthouse. The deceased and his partner were going to the courthouse to complete their day\\u2019s work. In London Guarantee &c. Co. v. Herndon, 81 Ga. App. 178 (58 S. E. 2d 510), the facts show that an employee was driving toward his home to fill out reports and complete his day\\u2019s woi\\u2019k, that he detoured and proceeded down the beach road for his personal pleasure, and that shortly thereafter he turned his car around and was proceeding back toward his home when the accident occurred. The court, quoting from Hartford Accident &c. Co. v. Welker, 75 Ga. App. 594 (44 S. E. 2d 160), held that our law does not require that an employee be restricted only to the business of the employer at the time of an injury, and moreover held that the instant the employee stopped his automobile and attempted to turn back he again resumed his duties of employment and was so engaged when he met his death. The test of whether or not an employee is within the scope of his employment at a certain time and place is (as has been held in innumerable decisions of the appel late courts), \\u201cWhere the employee breaks the continuity of his employment for purposes of his own and is injured before he brings himself back into the line of employment, his injury does not arise out of or in the course of his employment, but where the personal mission has been accomplished and the' employee is once more engaged in the duties of his employment, the injury arises out of and in the course of employment.\\u201d General Accident, Fire &c. Corp. v. Prescott, 80 Ga. App. 421 (56 S. E. 2d 137). In General Accident, Fire &c. Corp. v. Worley, 86 Ga. App. 794 (72 S. E. 2d 560), this court stated: \\u201cWhen injuries are sustained by employees who are not at the moment actually engaged in doing the work they have been hired to do, during [the] time for which compensation is paid them, but who are performing acts preparatory to entering or leaving their employment, or other incidental acts within the period of their employment but not strictly in furtherance of it, it becomes ordinarily a question of fact as to whether the requirements of the Workmen\\u2019s Compensation Law have been met, and the burden is upon the claimant to meet these requirements . . . Ordinarily, whether or not the accident arose out of and in the course of the employment is a question of fact, and the award of the board, if supported by any evidence, is conclusive.\\u201d There are many other cases cited to the same effect.\\nIt has been many times held that where the findings of the State Board of Workmen\\u2019s Compenstion are supported by any evidence it is mandatory on this court to approve such findings of fact and award.\\nThe hearing director of the State Board of Workmen\\u2019s Compensation awarded the widow of the deceased $25.50 per week for a period of 400 weeks and $350 for funeral expenses. This award was affirmed by the Superior Court of Fulton County and since the findings of fact and award of the State Board of Workmen\\u2019s Compensation is supported by sufficient facts, this court will not disturb them but will, on the contrary, affirm such findings of fact and award.\\nJudgment affirmed.\\nTownsend, Carlisle, 'and Frankum, JJ., concur.\",\n",

Cowin, J.\\nMotion by plaintiff in a negligence action now pending in the Civil Court of the City of New York, made pursuant to subdivision (b) of section 325 of the Civil Practice Law and Buies, to (1) remove said action to this court (2) to amend the ad damnum clause of the complaint so as to increase the amount thereof from $6,000 to $10,000 (3) transfer said action, as amended, to the Civil Court.\\nThe action was originally commenced in the City Court of the City of New York, County of Kings and was transferred to the Civil Court of the City of New York when that court came into being on September 1, 1962.\\nAn application to amend the ad damnum clause in the Civil Court was denied. The short-form order entered thereon indicates that the denial was based on the court’s lack of jurisdiction to grant the relief sought in view of the proviso of section 192 (subd. [c], par. [2]), now section 2203 (subd. [c], par. [2]) of the New York City Civil Court Act, contracting the jurisdiction of the Civil Court to that of the abolished court, so as to prevent the Civil Court from giving relief in an amount which could not be given in the abolished court.\\nSome of the reported and published decisions on this subject reveal a contrary view. In Cohen v. Bezold (37 Misc 2d 1081) and in Dolce v. Cayuga Foundation Corp. (38 Misc 2d 1078), Civil Court decisions, it was held that the Civil Court had jurisdiction to increase the ad damnum clause to the jurisdictional amount of the Civil Court on cases transferred to it by virtue of section 192, now section 2203 of the New York City Civil Court Act.\\nThe Appellate Term of this Department has recently passed on this question in Klein v. 124-132 White St. (41 Misc 2d 601). It was there held that the Civil Court was not precluded from considering on the merits an application to increase the damages sought in an action which had been transferred to that forum by the amalgamation of the Municipal Court and the Civil Court. The Appellate Term cited with approval the Cohen and Dolce cases (supra).\\nThis court is in accord with the foregoing decisions which held that the Civil Court has such jurisdiction. In view of this holding, subdivision (b) of section 325 of the Civil Practice Law and Buies is not applicable. Said section provides the authority for the removal of a cause of action from a court of limited jurisdiction where said court “ does not have jurisdiction to grant the relief to which the parties are entitled ”. (Emphasis supplied.)\\nAccordingly the motion is denied in all respects.',\n",

The amount involved brought the case within the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace, and the action was tried in the civil court of Milwaukee county and judgment rendered therein in favor of the defendants. Uo-'tice of appeal from the judgment of the civil court to the circuit court was filed in the civil court April 16, 1913, and thereafter the record was certified to the circuit court and filed therein on the 8th day of August, 1913. The eirenit court reversed the judgment of the civil court on the ground, as appears from the record, that the goods were sold to the defendants as undisclosed principals of one Tylicki. •\\nCounsel for appellants contend that the circuit court was in error in reversing the judgment of the civil court because there was sufficient evidence to support the civil court judgment, while on the part of the respondent it is insisted that on appeals to the circuit court from the civil court in actions like the present the appeal shall be heard upon the original papers in the manner provided by sec. 3769, Stats. This .section provides: “Upon the hearing of the appeal, . . . the appellate court shall give judgment according to the weight of the evidence and the justice of the case, without regard to technical errors which do not affect the merits and without regard to the finding of the justice. . . .”\\nIt will he seen that the Civil Court Act (Laws of 1909, ch. 549, sec. 28, sub. 8) provided, . . there shall be no new trial thereof by jury in the circuit court, if a jury trial-thereof was not demanded in the civil court or if the parties thereto may not of right require it, but such action shall be heard, determined and judgment therein rendered in the circuit court, on motion as hereinafter provided, upon the original papers and the return of the clerk of said civil court in the manner provided in section 3169 of the statutes.”\\nThe above quoted part was dropped out by amendment to sub. 3, sec. 28, ch. 549, of the Laws of 1909 by ch. 320, Laws of 1913; so it will be seen that before the instant ease reached the circuit court on appeal the law had been amended so as to make sec. 3769, relied upon by respondent, inapplicable. See Pabst B. Co. v. Milwaukee L. Co. 156 Wis. 615, 146 N. W. 879. This amendment is not argued or referred to by counsel on either side. But it is unnecessary to consider the effect of it, since we are convinced that giving the Civil Court Act the construction contended for at the time of the trial in the civil court the judgment of said civil court must be affirmed, because a careful examination of the evidence convinces us that the judgment of the civil court is supported by the weight of the evidence, hence the circuit court was in error in reversing the judgment of 'the civil court.\\nThere are other points raised by appellants respecting the legal capacity of the plaintiff to sue, the failure of the plaintiff to comply with sec. 1770b, Stats., and whether the sale in question involved interstate commerce. But in the view we take of the case it is unnecessary to consider these •contentions.\\nBy the Court. — The judgment of the circuit court is reversed, and the cause remanded with instructions to the cir•cuit court to affirm the judgment of the civil court.\",\n",

       "       'text': 'Davis, J.\\n—The petitioner, L. Salario, filed his application in this Court for certiorari on January 5, 1932. The writ of certiorari was issued on said date to \"W\". A. Dickenson, Clerk of the Circuit Court in and for Hillsborough County, directing said Clerk to transmit to this Court the record of a certain cause which had originated in the Civil Court of Record in and for Hillsborough County wherein the Latin-American Bank, a, corporation, was plaintiff, and L. Salario was defendant.\\nJudgment in that cause was entered in the Civil Court of Record on December 8, 1931, in favor of the plaintiff, Latin-American Bank.\\nOn December 31, 1931, Chapter 14663, Acts of 1931, abolishing the Civil Court of Record of Hillsborough County, became effective. By the terms of that Act it was provided that on December 31, 1931, all eases pending in the abolished Civil Court of Record should be transferred by the Clerk of said Court to the Circuit Court of the County and there docketed by the Clerk of the Circuit Court and said eases tried and disposed of in the Circuit Court.\\nAs we have heretofore stated, the judgment of the Civil Court of Record was entered on December 8, 1931. It may be granted as true, therefore, that during the period of time intervening between December 8, 1931, and December 31, 1931, a writ of error might have been sued out from the Circuit Court to the Civil Court of Record for the purpose of having its judgment reviewed by the Circuit Court of Hillsborough County instead of by certiorari from this Court. But it is also true that petitioner did not file his petition for certiorari in this Court until January 5, 1932. This was after the abolition of the Civil Court of Record had become effective and was at a time when no writ of error could have been obtained by him either from the Circuit Court or from this Court.\\nThe respondent named in the petition in this Court, Latin-American Bank, was plaintiff in the Civil Court of Record. The writ issued has not yet been returned, and accordingly respondent has appeared herein and filed its motion to supersede the writ of certiorari.\\nThe motion is based upon seventeen grounds. Movant’s claim is that the petition for certiorari afforded no basis for the issuance of the writ in the first instance and that in consequence thereof it should now he superseded by this CQurt before it has been returned.\\nThat a motion to supersede a writ of certiorari is the proper means by which to attack such a writ before the same has been returned into the Court from which it issued must be recognized by us as the proper practice. See Crandall’s Practice, page 660.\\nAfter return of a writ of certiorari the proper practice is to move that the writ itself be quashed, if it be conceived that same cannot be legally maintained.\\nIn the present case the principal argument in support of the motion to supersede the writ of certiorari is that while the cause passed to judgment in the Civil Court of Record on December 8, 1931, that it is nevertheless pending in the Circuit Court of Hillsborough County by virtue of the terms of Chapter 14663, Acts of 1931, which provided that all eases pending in the abolished Civil Court of Record should be transferred by the Clerk of said Court to the Circuit Court and there docketed by the Clerk of the Circuit Court to be tried and disposed of in the Circuit Court.\\nThe case in question, however, originated in the Civil Court of Record and final judgment in it was entered in it by the Civil Court of Record and not by the Circuit Court. At the time the writ of certiorari was applied for in this Court no appellate proceedings had been taken to have the judgment of the Civil Court of Record reviewed by the Circuit Court on writ of error. While it is undoubtedly true, as movant contends, that a writ of error could have been sued out during the period of time intervening between December 8, 1931, and December 31, 1931, and this would have given the Circuit Court appellate jurisdiction to review the judgment had such writ of error been prosecuted, it is also true that no such writ of error was in fact sued out, nor attempted to be sued out, prior to the time that the Civil Court of Record became actually functus officio under the statute. Nor was petitioner required by law to sue out such writ of error during that period. So the situation with which we are required to deal is therefore whether or not at the time the writ of certiorari was applied for here, there was any established means of appellate review which would have been followed by the petitioner after Chapter 14663, supra, went into effect on December 31, 1931, so as ■to preclude the use of certiorari because of the existence of an adequate remedy otherwise.\\nUnder Section 5 of Article V of the Constitution the Supreme Court only has appellate jurisdiction in eases at law originating in the Circuit Courts. The present case did not “originate” in the Circuit Court of Hillsborough County because it was brought and prosecuted to a final judgment in the Civil Court of Record. This also was done at a time when the Circuit Court of Hillsborough County was without jurisdiction with regard to it except on appeal from the Civil Court of Record in the manner provided by law so long as that Court remained in existence. At the time the writ of certiorari in this case was applied for, namely, January 5, 1932, it is patent also that no writ of error could have been issued from the Circuit Court to the Civil Court of Record, because all jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of Hillsborough County to issue a writ of error on that date to review a judgment of the Civil Court of Record had been ended by the taking effect of the statute which had disestablished the Civil Court of Record of that County.\\nSuch being the case, there was no adequate review provided by law to redress the fundamental errors complained of in the petition for certiorari, and therefore such writ of certiorari was properly applied for and issued on January 5, 1932, in the instant case.\\nThe writ as issued was also properly directed to the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Hillsborough County as the then custodian of the records of the abolished Civil Court of Record. See State ex rel. Landis v. Dickenson, opinion filed December 18, 1931.\\nThe present motion does not involve the merits of the controversy, and we are therefore not called upon to determine at this time whether or not the judgment complained of, or the writ of certiorari issued with regard to it, should be quashed. That question is a proposition which it is proper to determine only after a return to the writ and after full argument and consideration on the merits of the case as presented by the record and briefs of the parties.\\nWe hold, therefore, that when a case has originated in a Civil Court of Record and a judgment therein has been entered in such Civil Court of Record, and thereafter the Civil Court of Record is abolished by statute, so as to cut off the right to review the judgment by writ of error from the Circuit Court to such Civil Court of Record, that certiorari is a proper means to reach and correct errors apparent of record in the ease as disposed of in the Civil Court of Record, which show that the latter Court did not proceed according to the essential requirements of law in rendering its judgment.\\nIt follows that the motion to supersede the writ of certiorari must be denied and the cause retained for disposition in due course of law upon return to the writ.\\nWhitfield, P.J., and Terrell, J., concur.\\nBuford, C.J., and Ellis and Brown, J.J., concur in the opinion and judgment.',\n",

       "       'text': '—Orders, Supreme Court, New York County (Harold Tompkins, J.), entered June 19, 1997, which, to the extent appealed from, removed the consolidated actions to the Civil Court, New York County, pursuant to CPLR 325 (d), unanimously reversed, on the law, without costs, the summary non-payment proceeding commenced in Civil Court by defendant Oktagon Corporation is stayed pending the determination of the consolidated actions in the Supreme Court, and the matter is remanded to the Supreme Court for further proceedings in accordance herewith.\\nPlaintiff W.H.P. 20, Inc. (WHP) is the current owner of the premises located at 71-73 Murray Street, in Manhattan, having acquired title pursuant to a mortgage foreclosure sale. The defendants are commercial tenants and subtenants in the building, who obtained their leaseholds before WHP acquired title. WHP refuses to recognize the validity of the defendants’ leases and has rejected their attempts to pay rent. Since the mortgagee in the prior foreclosure action failed to name the tenants and subtenants as defendants in that action, WHP commenced an action pursuant to RPAPL 1352 to extinguish any rights or equities of redemption of the tenants (and subtenants) in the property. This action, known as a “strict foreclosure” action, was commenced in the Supreme Court, New York County.\\nSince WHP and the tenants were simultaneously demanding rent payments from the subtenants, some of the subtenants stopped paying rent altogether. On May 13, 1997, one of the tenants, defendant Oktagon Corporation (Oktagon), commenced summary non-payment proceedings in New York County Civil Court against its subtenants.\\nIn the strict foreclosure action, WHP moved for an order establishing reasonable use and occupancy to be paid by the tenants and subtenants pending the outcome of that action, and to stay Oktagon’s Civil Court non-payment proceedings pending a hearing in the Supreme Court scheduled for June 11, 1997. On June 10, 1997, the subtenants responded to Oktagon’s Civil Court eviction proceedings by commencing their own Supreme Court action against WHP and Oktagon, seeking a declaratory judgment pursuant to CPLR 3001 regarding their rent obligations. On the same day, the subtenants presented an order to show cause to the Supreme Court seeking a stay of the eviction proceedings. The court declined to sign the order, but directed the subtenants to appear the next day at the Supreme Court hearing on WHP’s motion for use and occupancy.\\nAt the June 11 hearing, counsel for both WHP and the sub- . tenants argued that the Civil Court proceedings should be stayed since the continuation of two actions in separate courts could result in conflicting rulings, and because all the relevant parties had appeared in the Supreme Court action but not the Civil Court action. The IAS Court rejected these arguments, consolidated the Supreme Court actions and transferred them to the Civil Court pursuant to CPLR 325 (d). The court was also unpersuaded by the arguments of WHP’s counsel that the transfer was inappropriate since the Civil Court lacked jurisdiction over the strict foreclosure action.\\nThe Civil Court of the City of New York is a court of limited jurisdiction, having no general equity jurisdiction except as specifically provided by law (see, CCA 201 et seq.; Kwoczka v Dry Dock Sav. Bank, 52 Misc 2d 67, 70). As WHP’s strict foreclosure action seeking to “fix the right of any person having a right of redemption therein” (RPAPL 1352) is plainly equitable in nature, the Civil Court must be given express authority to entertain such an action.\\nWhile CCA 203 gives the Civil Court jurisdiction over various types of actions seeking equitable relief as to real property, such as an action to foreclose a mortgage or lien (CCA 203 [b], [c]), a strict foreclosure proceeding is not among the enumerated actions. Moreover, even were a strict foreclosure action deemed analogous to an action to foreclose a mortgage or lien, the statute affords the Civil Court jurisdiction only where the debt upon which the action is brought “does not exceed $25,000.” (Ibid.) Here, since the judgment of foreclosure was for approximately $7.17 million, WHP’s action sought to foreclose the rights of redemption in property involving a mortgage debt far in excess of the Civil Court’s jurisdictional limit (see, CCA 202, 203).\\nConcluding, as we have, that the Civil Court does not have jurisdiction over the strict foreclosure action, it was error for the IAS Court to transfer said action to the Civil Court (see, Doo Soon Chung v Doo Nam Kim, 170 AD2d 232, 233). The declaratory judgment action should also have remained in Supreme Court, as the Civil Court has no jurisdiction to grant such relief and the action was interrelated with the strict foreclosure proceeding. This is not a case where the commencement of a Supreme Court action may be construed as an attempt to avoid Civil Court jurisdiction over landlord-tenant disputes (cf., Cox v J.D. Realty Assocs., 217 AD2d 179, 180).\\nAccordingly, we grant WHP’s motion to stay the Civil Court summary proceedings pending the determination of the Supreme Court actions. WHP is entitled to the payment of use and occupancy by Oktagon pending said determination, with the amount to be set by the Supreme Court. Concur — Wallach, J.

       "       'text': '— In a proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 78, inter alia, to enjoin the Department of Housing Preservation and Development of the City of New York from taking certain actions in the Civil Court of the City of New York, Queens County, the department appeals from so much of an order of the Supreme Court, Queens County (Buschmann, J.), dated July 3,1980, as, upon its motion to dismiss, (1) converted the article 78 proceeding into an action for a declaratory judgment and (2) enjoined, pending the determination of the declaratory judgment action, further proceedings in an action commenced by the department against petitioners in the Civil Court for enforcement of certain housing violations and recovery of civil penalties, provided petitioners file an undertaking in the amount of $5,000. Order reversed, insofar as appealed from, on the law, preliminary injunction vacated, motion to dismiss granted and the petition is dismissed as to the department, without costs or disbursements. Petitioners, if they are so disposed, may amend their answer in the Civil Court action to include as additional defenses the constitutional claims raised in their petition herein. It was error for Special Term to convert the article 78 proceeding into an action for a declaratory judgment and to enjoin, pending determination of the merits of petitioners’ various constitutional claims, further proceedings in the Civil Court. Except in one statutorily defined instance not applicable herein (see CCA, § 212-a), the Civil Court of the City of New York lacks jurisdiction to render a declaratory judgment (see CPLR 3001). Contrary to Special Term’s determination, however, an adjudication of the merits of petitioners’ various constitutional claims, raised by way of answer in the Civil Court action, does not necessitate the granting of a declaratory judgment. The department’s Civil Court action for enforcement of certain housing violations and for civil penalties clearly was within the jurisdiction of the Civil Court (see CCA, § 110). Petitioners’ constitutional claims consisted of challenges to the local laws sought to be enforced and were, therefore, properly interposed as defenses in said action and could be considered by the Civil Court (see CCA, § 905). In this regard, the cases of Housing & Dev. Admin, of City of N. Y. v Community Housing Improvement Program (83 Misc 2d 977, mod 90 Misc 2d 813, affd 59 AD2d 773) and Matter of Voccola v Shilling (88 Misc 2d 103, affd 57 AD2d 931), upon which Special Term relied, are distinguishable. In Housing & Dev. Admin, of City of N. Y. v Community Housing Improvement Program (supra), the merits of the constitutional claims raised had no effect upon whether the plaintiff was entitled to the requested relief. In fact, such claims did not arise until after the plaintiff had been granted its requested relief, when a constitutional exploration into an entire body of local laws was conducted. In Matter of Voccola v Shilling (supra), the constitutional claims were raised in conjunction with a motioii to vacate a default judgment rendered by the Parking Violations Bureau. Inasmuch as the Civil Court lacked jurisdiction in the first instance to consider such relief, any determination as to the merits of the constitutional claims would have been the equivalent of a declaratory judgment. While the merits of the constitutional claims raised by way of defense in petitioners’ answer in the Civil Court action could be properly adjudicated therein, we note that the specific constitutional claims raised by petitioners in the article 78 proceeding were never raised in the Civil Court action. Those claims, however, if raised in the Civil Court action, could be properly adjudicated therein as well, inasmuch as they are also directed at the local laws sought to be enforced. Accordingly, an action for a declaratory judgment does not lie, and petitioners, if they are so disposed, may amend their answer in the Civil Court action to include as additional defenses the constitutional claims raised in their petition.

       "       'text': \"Benjamin Brenner, J.\\nPlaintiff judgment creditor seeks to punish defendant judgment debtor for contempt for failure to comply with a subpoena issued out of the court. The question here is whether the Supreme Court should reject proceedings for the enforcement of a money judgment of the Civil Court where the judgment debtor resides or has a place of business or transacts business in one of the counties within the City of New York.\\nUnder section 777 of the Civil Practice Act a proceeding against a judgment debtor could be instituted in the City Court only within the county where the judgment was rendered and only if the debtor resided or was regularly employed or had a place for the regular transaction of business in person in that county. Thus, if the Civil Practice Act were still in effect the judgment creditor here could not bring a proceeding in the Kings County Civil Court since the conditions above-enumerated do not exist. However, CPLB, 5221, subd. (a), par. 2 now provides that if the judgment sought to be enforced was entered in the Municipal Court of the City of New York, the City Court of the City of New York, or the Civil Court of the City of New York and the judgment debtor resides or is regularly employed or has a place for the regular transaction of business in person anywhere within the city the special proceeding for the enforcement of the money judgment “ shall be commenced in the civil court of the city of New York.” Thus, on the facts here obtaining, the judgment creditor may presently institute the proceedings in the Civil Court.\\nThe problem is, however, complicated by CPLB 5018, subd. (a) which provides that a money judgment of the Civil Court may be docketed with the County Clerk and ‘ ‘ A judgment docketed by transcript under this .subdivision shall have the same effect as a docketed judgment entered in the supreme court within the county where it is docketed.” It may consequently be argued that .since a docketed judgment such as the one under consideration here has the same effect as a Supreme Court judgment, the judgment creditor may also pursue his remedies for the enforcement of a money judgment out of this court.\\nYet it seems to me that the .sense ,of these sections, when read read together, is to avoid the enforcement of a judgment in the Supreme Court when possible, and to relegate such enforcement to the Civil Court where the judgment debtor resides within the city. While it is still necessary to docket the judgment with the ‘County Clerk to enable the judgment creditor to subsequently docket his judgment in another county, the more or less peremptory language of CPLR 5221, subd. (a), par. 2 should not be ignored, namely, that the special proceeding '‘ shall be commenced in the civil court of the city of New York.” So, even if we assume that by virtue of CPLR 5018, subd. (a) the judgment creditor could bring his proceedings to enforce the money judgment in the Supreme Court, it should be the policy of the Supreme Court to reject such proceedings when they are also available to the judgment creditor in the Civil Court (CCA, §§ 1505, 1508). This, too, is the logical conclusion in the light of the obvious trend of the CPLR and the Civil Court Act to broaden the jurisdiction of the Civil Court. '\\nAccordingly, the motion to punish is denied, without prejudice to the institution of a proceeding in the Civil Court.\",\n",

       "       'text': 'Order, Supreme Court, New York County (Harold Tompkins, J.), entered June 30, 1989, granting the motion of defendant to dismiss the action; and, order of the same court, entered September 22, 1989, granting reargument and, upon reconsideration, adhering to its prior determination, are both unanimously affirmed, without costs.\\nIn 1986, defendant landlord brought a holdover proceeding in Civil Court to recover possession of plaintiffs apartment on the grounds that it was utilized for business purposes. Plaintiff counterclaimed, seeking, inter alia, compensatory and punitive damages for alleged retaliatory eviction and breach of warranty of habitability. The Civil Court (Peter Tom, J.) found that the limited business use of the premises did not significantly violate the lease. In response to a posttrial motion, the court denied compensatory and punitive damages. By stipulation so ordered, the claim based upon the warranty of habitability was severed to remain in Civil Court. Plaintiff thereafter sought to vacate the stipulation, which motion was denied. Both pretrial orders were thereafter affirmed (Simkowitz v Stewart, NYLJ, Jan. 30, 1990, at 21, col 5 [App Term, 1st Dept]).\\nPlaintiff thereafter commenced this action seeking punitive damages asserting, inter alia, the warranty of habitability claims. Defendant brought a nonpayment proceeding in Civil Court in which plaintiff again asserted, inter alia, warranty of habitability claims in his counterclaim. Defendant moved to dismiss the Supreme Court action, arguing, inter alia, that the parties had intended to assert the habitability claims in Civil Court and that plaintiff had raised said claims in the nonpayment proceeding. Prior to oral argument in Supreme Court, a stipulation was reached in Civil Court regarding arrears and the counterclaim was severed and withdrawn without prejudice on the grounds that, inter alia, plaintiff could proceed with such claim in Supreme Court. The Supreme Court dismissed the complaint, stating that the claims had been raised and resolved in the original Civil Court proceeding, that the same relief was sought in a new proceeding which was currently pending, and noting Civil Court’s specialized expertise in landlord-tenant actions. Plaintiff moved for reargument, arguing that the counterclaims had been withdrawn without prejudice in Civil Court. The Supreme Court adhered to its original determination, noting that the counterclaims arose from the underlying landlord-tenant dispute and that it was preferable for Civil Court to handle such matters. We agree.\\nContrary to plaintiffs contentions, as the warranty of habitability claim was originally severed, it need not be reasserted in Civil Court (see, CPLR 603). Further, as the claim is in the nature of a counterclaim, the limit on damages does not apply (CCA 208 [b]). Finally, absent a need for relief which can only be granted in Supreme Court, matters regarding the landlord-tenant relationship should be heard in Civil Court (see, e.g., Post v 120 E. End Ave. Corp., 62 NY2d 19, 28). Since the habitability claim raises issues regarding compliance with housing standards, it is especially suited for adjudication in Civil Court (Missionary Sisters of Sacred Heart v Meer, 131 AD2d 393).\\nThe court also properly found no basis for the imposition of sanctions. As such award is within the discretion of the IAS court, it should not be disturbed (22 NYCRR 130-1.1 [a], [c]). Concur—Murphy, P. J., Sullivan, Carro, Milonas and Smith, JJ.',\n",

On May 15,1931, a writ of error was taken to the circuit court. By Chapter 14663, Acts of 1931, the civil court of record for Hillsborough County was abolished, the statute becoming effective December 31, 1931. On February 1, 1932, the circuit court reversed the judgment of the civil court of record and remanded the cause “for a new trial.” A writ of certiorari was issued from this court upon a petition alleging that the circuit court had no power to reverse the judgment of the civil court of record after such court had been abolished, and that the correct rule of law had not been applied by the circuit court in reversing the judgment that had been rendered by the civil court of record. The respondent moves to quash the writ of certiorari. If the circuit court had no authority to exercise its appellate jurisdiction to determine a cause on writ of error to a judgment of the civil court of record after the latter court had been abolished, though the writ of error was taken before such court was abolished, a writ o'f certiorari may be a proper remedy. When the judgment of the civil court O'f record was reversed, the court had been abolished and the causes pending therein were by law transferred to the circuit court for trial and disposition.

While a possible legal effect of the reversal by the circuit court of the judgment of the abolished civil court of record might' .be a right to a new trial to be had in the circuit court to which the causes pending in the civil court of record were transferred upon the abolition of the civil court of record, yet such reversal involving a question of jurisdiction may, under the circumstances here shown, be reviewed by certiorari if allowed by this court.\\nBy section 1, Article V, constitution of 1885, “the judicial power of the State shall be vested in a Supreme Court, Circuit Courts, County Judges, and Justices of the Peace.” An amendment adopted in 1914 added “Court of Record of Escambia County” “and such other courts or commissions as the Legislature may from time to time ordain and establish.”\\nUnder amended section 1, Article V of the constitution, Chapter 6904, Acts of 1915, provided for a “Civil Court of Record in each county -which has, or shall have, a population of more than seventy thousand (70,000) according to the last preceding Federal census, or as such census hereafter taken: Provided, that the provisions of this Act shall not apply to any county which has been divided subsequent to the last preceding Federal census * By the Federal census of 1910, only two counties in Florida had “a population of more than seventy thousand.” Duval county had 75,163 population and Hillsborough county had 78,374 population. As Hillsborough county had “been divided subsequent to the last preceding Federal census,”in the formation of Pinellas county by Chapter 6247, Acts of 1911, Duval county was the only one in which a civil court of record was established under Chapter 6904, Acts of 1915.\\nChapter 8521, Acts of 1921, provided for a “Civil Court of Record in each county which has, or shall have, a population of more than an hundred thousand (100,000) according to the last preceding Federal census, or as such Federal census is 'hereafter taken; and that “The Civil Court of Record in existence under” Chapter 6904, Acts of 1915, sections 3310 to 3324, Revised General Statutes, “is hereby abolished, its termination being in all respects effectual and final when but not until the Judge hereunder provided for shall be lawfully commissioned.”\\nBy the Federal census of 1920, Duval county was the only county in the State having a population of more than 100,000 and consequently a civil court of record existed only in Duval County under Chapter 8521, Acts of 1921, though such a court could have been established in other counties subsequently attaining more than 100,000 population according to' the later Federal censusses, if Chapter 8521 had not been superseded by .Chapter 11357, Acts of 1925, except as to the provisions of Chapter 8521 which are still applicable to the civil court of record for Duval county. Chapter 11357, Acts of Extra Session 1925, effective January 1, 1926, provided for a “civil court of record in each county in the State of Florida, which has or shall have a population of more than One Hundred Thousand (100,000) according to the last State census, or as such census hereafter taken, provided that the provisions of this Act shall not apply to any county in which there has heretofore been established a civil court of record.” See sections 5156 et seq. Compiled General Laws, 1927, for general provisions relating to civil courts of record.\\n'By the State census of 1925, the population of Duval county was 123,396; Dade county, 111,413; Hillsborough county, 133,384. No other county had a population of more than 100,000. Under Chapter 11357, a civil court of record was established in each of the counties of Hills-borough and Dade. As a civil court of record had theretofore been established in Duval County, such court was excepted from the provisions of Chapter 11357, Acts of 1925, leaving Chapter 8521, Acts of 1921, applicable only to Duval county; and the provisions of such Chapter 8521 were not included in the general laws contained in the Compiled General Laws of 1927.\\nUnder section 11, Article V, constitution, “The Circuit Courts * * shall have final appellate jurisdiction in all civil and criminal cases arising in the county court” * * “and appellate jurisdiction * of such other matters as the legislature may provide.”\\nSection 11, Chapter 11357, provides that:\\n“The circuit courts shall have appellate jurisdiction in all cases decided by such civil courts of record in the same manner and with the same limitations as in writs of error from the Circuit to the Supreme Court.” See Sec. 1, Ch. 15666, Acts 1931, giving Circuit Courts “final appellate jurisdiction” in such eases.\\nSection 1, Chapter 14663, Acts of 1931, enacts that: “The Civil Court of Record in and for Hillsborough County, Florida, be and the same is hereby abolished and all cases pending in said Court on the dates of its abolishment shall be transferred by the Clerk of said Court to the Circuit Court of said County and there docketed by the Clerk of the said Circuit Court and said cases shall be tried and disposed of in said Circuit Court.”\\nThe effect of Chapter 14663 is merely to abolish the civil court of record for Hillsbokough county created under Chapter 11357, leaving the provisions of Chapter 11357 in force.\\nIn this ease the writ of error from the Circuit Court to the judgment of the civil court of record for Hillsborough coiinty was issued and made effective before the civil court of record was abolished; and the abolition of such court does not affect the appellate jurisdiction already acquired by the circuit court under Chapter 11357 which is still in force, notwithstanding the abolition of the civil court of record for Hillsborough county.\\nThe amended declaration filed in the cause in the civil court of record by Frances McBride joined by her husband, Elias McBride, and W. T. Whitlock against the insurance company alleges in substance that the defendant issued to Mrs. Edith Callahan, its policy of insurance upon stated property with New York standard mortgage clause in favor of W. T. Whitlock, the mortgagee attached; that W. T. Whitlock assigned the mortgage and the note secured by the mortgage to Carl Baughman who endorsed the same to Frances McBride, but said Carl Baughman endorsed same without recourse as to him, ‘ ‘ and said insurance policy with said New York Standard Mortgage Clause attached thereto was deposited, with said mortgage and note, in the hands of said Prances McBride as collateral security, said endorsements and assignments being made after said New York Standard Mortgage Clause was attached to said policy, and before the burning of said building, as herein-before set forth, and plaintiff W. T. Whitlock, is still bound and obligated on his assignment and endorsement of said mortgage and note to the plaintiff, Prances McBride; and said building was burned and destroyed under such circumstances as to come within the promise and undertaking of said policy.”\\nThe circuit court, on writ of error to a judgment for the plaintiffs, held that there was error in refusing to allow the defendant to show there was no privity of contract between the plaintiff, Prances McBride, the assignee of the mortgagee and the insurer, who did not know of the assignment; and that no insurable interest in W. T. Whitlock was Shown, in view of his assignment of his interest in the note and mortgage.\\nThe circuit court may have overlooked the possible liability of Whitlock on his assignment of the note and mortmage and a consequent insurable interest of Whitlock in the mortgaged property insured, under the principle stated in 1 Cooley’s Briefs-on Insurance (2nd Ed.) p. 254, 290, that ‘ ‘ though the mortgagee has assigned the notes and mortgage, his liability on his assignment gives him an insurable interest.” See Joyce on Insurance, Section 1042; 9 L. R. A. (N. S.) 490. But it is not shown that the plaintiff, Prances McBride, was in privity with or had a right of action against the insurer; and for this reason alone the judgment of the civil court of record against the defendant in her favor, was properly reversed by the circuit court.\\nThe writ of certiorari is quashed.\\nTerrell and Davis, J.J., concur.\\nBuford, C.J. and Brown, J., concur in the opinion and judgment.\",\n",

T. Whitlock” against the “American Central Insurance Company of St. Louis, Missouri, a corporation” on a fire insurance policy. The record does not show that Mrs. McBride had a right to maintain the action.\\nThe judgment reversed by the Circuit Court upon writ of error was rendered by the trial court in favor of “Prances McBride, joined by her husband, Elias McBride and W. T. Whitlock.” The judgment for the plaintiffs jointly was erroneous; and even if the error be harmless to the defendant, this court will not on certiorari quash the judgment of the Circuit Court reversing on writ of error the judgment of the trial court that is at least formally erroneous. The writ of certiorari was issued by this Court to determine the question of jurisdiction discussed in the opinion heretofore filed.\\nIn S. S. O. & G. Ry. v. Van Ness, the contract sued on was “made with the plaintiffs jointly” and the judgment was rendered “in the names of the husband and wife” who made the contract with the defendant corporation.\\nThe policy was to insure property of Edith Callahan with a clause to' indemnify “W. T. Whitlock as first mortgagee (or trustee) as interest may appear.” Whitlock assigned to Baughman who assigned to Prances McBride. The insurance policy was not transferred but merely deposited with the mortgage and note “in the hands of Prances McBride as collateral security.” If Whitlock has an insurable interest in the property because of his assignment of the mortgage and the note secured by the mortgage and if Mrs. McBride has any interest in the insurance policy when it was merely delivered to her with the note and mortgage, her interest is through Whitlock and not by privity with the insurance company.\\nRehearing denied.\\nWhitfield, P.J. and Terrell and Davis, J.J., concur.\\nBuford C.J. and Brown, J., concur in the opinion and judgment.\\nPiled under Rule 21A.\",\n",

       "       'text': \"Owen, J.\\nIt seems to be appellant’s contention that, because he was unable to enforce the judgment of eviction recovered against the defendant in the civil court, the defendant is not now entitled to the $200 deposited by him in court at the time he commenced the unlawful detainer action. It is not necessary for us to consider defendant’s right to recover this money in an independent action, or whether its tender was necessary as a condition precedent to the maintenance of the action of unlawful detainer. Whether necessary for him to do so or not, the plaintiff voluntarily and unconditionally paid the money into court for the benefit of the defendant. This is a conclusive admission that the amount so paid into court is due to the tenderee, and the money belongs absolutely to her. Fox v. Williams, 92 Wis. 320, 66 N. W. 357. The order of the civil court directing the clerk to pay the money to the defendant was therefore correct.\\nThe appellant raises a question of practice which remains to be considered. The order of the civil court was affirmed by a judgment of the circuit court, which ordered and adjudged that the defendant “have and recover her costs and disbursements on this appeal, the same being taxed at, and being, sixteen and 70-100 dollars.” Appellant contends that the entry of such judgment upon the affirmance of an order on appeal from the civil court is not authorized.\\nThe civil court of Milwaukee county was created by ch. 549 of the Laws of 1909. Sec. 28 of said chapter relates to appeals from the orders and judgments of said civil court to the circuit court. Sub. 2 of said section provides:\\n“Every order of said civil court from which an appeal is taken' shall be either affirmed or reversed'by the circuit court, and the action in which such order was made shall be returned to the clerk of said civil court for further proceedings according to law and in accordance with the direction of said circuit court.” •\\nSub. 4 of said sec. 28 provides that at any time after the filing in the circuit court of the return Upon any appeal from said civil court any party to the action may move that the order appealed from be affirmed or reversed. It thus appears that upon an appeal from an order of the civil court the matter is brought on for hearing before the'circuit court by a motion made in the usual and ordinary way. The usual and ordinary way of disposing of such motion is by order'of the court. This order either affirms or reverses' the order appealed from. Upon the affirmance or reversal .of the order, “the action in which such order was made shall be returned to the clerk of said civil court for further proceedings •according to law and in accordance with the direction of said circuit court.” We discover no authority and see no necessity for the entry of a formal judgment by the circuit court in disposing of the matter. Its determination is evidenced by its order disposing of the motion to affirm or reverse. No doubt the circuit court has power and authority to impose the ordinary costs of the motion, the payment of which is to be enforced in the usual and ordinary way. But we search in vain for any provision of the civil court act, or any other statutory provision, authorizing the circuit court to render a judgment for costs, or to impose any other costs than the usual and ordinary motion costs. The entry of the judgment was erroneous as a matter of practice. The judgment, therefore, should be vacated and set aside. This, however, will not disturb the order of the circuit court affirming the order, appealed from. That will stand, and upon the remission of the record from this court the circuit court will remit the record to the civil court.\\nWhile the appellant prevails upon the question of practice, it is but an incidental question, and should not entitle him to tax costs in this court. No costs will be taxed by either party, but the appellant will pay the clerk’s fees.\\nBy the Court. — So ordered.\",\n",

The lease provided that in case of a sale of the premises the. lease could be terminated by giving ninety days' notice to the defendant and paying to her $50 each year said lease had to run. The lessor sold the premises to the plaintiff. Pie duly served the notice required to terminate the lease and tendered to the defendant $200 liquidated damages provided by the lease. Defendant refused to vacate. Plaintiff brought an action of unlawful detainer in the civil court of Milwaukee county to evict defendant from the premises. He paid the $200 liquidated damages provided by the lease into court, with reference to which the complaint contains this allegation:\\n“That said plaintiff now is, and at all times was, ready, able, and willing to pay to the said defendant the said sum of $200, and brings the said sum of $200 into court, to be paid to the said defendant, in accordance with the tender so made and in accordance with the provisions of said lease.”\\nPlaintiff recovered a judgment of eviction in the civil court. In due course a writ of restitution issued. The sheriff was restrained from executing the writ upon the suit of a sublessee of the defendant. This action prevented eviction for a period of about eighteen months. The judgment of eviction was rendered October 14, 1921. In April, 1923, defendant applied to the civil court of Milwaukee county for an order directing the clerk to pay the sum of $200 deposited by plaintiff in court, to the defendant. This order was granted and, upon appeal, was affirmed-by the circuit court for Milwaukee county. From the judgment of affirmance plaintiff brings this appeal.\\nFor the appellant there was a brief by Friedrich & Hack-'barth of Milwaukee, and oral argument by Otto G.

       "       'text': 'Order, Supreme Court, New York County (Richard S. Lane, J.), entered September 28, 1983, denying defendant’s motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to CPLR 3211 (subd [a], par 4) or to stay this action pending the determination of a summary proceeding in the Civil Court of the City of New York, New York County, and granting plaintiff’s cross motion to remove and consolidate that proceeding with this action, modified, on the law and the facts and in the exercise of discretion, to the extent of staying this action pending determination of the Civil Court summary proceeding, and denying plaintiff’s cross motion to remove and consolidate the Civil Court summary proceeding with this action, and otherwise affirmed, with costs. 11 Appeal from order, Supreme Court, New York County (Richard S. Lane, J.), entered May 24,1983, dismissed, without costs, said order having been superseded by the order of September 28, 1983.11 Defendant Goldfein is a partner of 185 East 85th Street Company, the owner of premises 185 East 85th Street, Manhattan, and is the lessee of apartment No. 34G in said premises, under a written lease executed in July, 1979, for the period July 1,1979 to June 30,1991 at a rental of $1 per year. Apparently this lease was executed as part of the settlement of certain disputes between the partners. 11 On or about October 1, 1982 the brother of another partner of the owner, allegedly with authority from the partner, leased the same apartment to Vibrator Sales and Promotions Advertising Inc./Ronald Cohen for the period October 1, 1982 to September 30, 1985 at a monthly rental of $900. Ronald Cohen, the plaintiff in this action, is currently occupying the apartment, paying the rent and claiming to be a rent-stabilized tenant. It appears that he lives in the apartment and also conducts a business there, known as Vibrator Sales and Promotions Advertising Inc., named as a colessee in the lease. U As a consequence, plaintiff and defendant appear to have overlapping leases. The underlying issue is which lease is valid. The contretemps is apparently a result of a partnership dispute. II On November 5, 1982 Goldfein served a 10-day notice upon Cohen to quit by November 16,1982 on the ground that Cohen was occupying the premises without permission or consent of the lessee, the person entitled to possession and occupancy. On November 16, 1982 Cohen commenced this declaratory judgment action asserting three causes of action: (1) Cohen entered into possession with the permission of the owner; he is not a squatter; Goldfein’s lease is illusory and a nullity; Goldfein never occupied the apartment and never paid rent; and Cohen is entitled to judgment declaring his entitlement to possession; (2) $10,000 damages for attorney’s fees; (3) $1 million damages for pain and suffering caused by Goldfein’s notice to quit. 11 Goldfein then instituted a summary squatter proceeding in the Civil Court pursuant to RPAPL 713. Goldfein moved in this action pursuant to CPLR 3211 (subd la], par 4) to dismiss, or under CPLR 2201, to stay this action upon the ground of another action pending for the same relief, viz., the Civil Court summary proceeding. The motion was premised upon the grounds that the Civil Court was a preferred forum for resolution of this type of dispute and could speedily consider and resolve all issues including plaintiff’s damage claims which could be asserted as counterclaims in the summary proceeding (CCA 208, subd [b]; 905; RPAPL 743), and that the declaratory relief sought by Cohen is wholly unnecessary. In the interim Cohen moved to dismiss the Civil Court proceeding on the ground of improper service. Goldfein discontinued the Civil Court proceeding and started a new one for the same relief. The Civil Court denied Cohen’s motions to dismiss. 11 In the face of these determinations, Special Term, in the order appealed from, denied Goldfein’s motion to dismiss the complaint or stay the action and directed the transfer of the Civil Court summary proceeding to the Supreme Court to be consolidated with this action, upon the ground that the squatter proceeding in the Civil Court could not lie because Goldfein was not in possession. 11 We disagree. It is well settled that a lessee out of possession may maintain a summary squatter’s proceeding against a subsequent lessee (Kaplan v Volk, 273 App Div 215). RPAPL 713 (subd 3) provides for a summary proceeding where the person in possession has “intruded into or squatted upon the property without the permission of the person entitled to possession and occupancy has continued without permission”. There is a dispute as to whether Goldfein was in possession at the time of Cohen’s entry. The Civil Court plainly has power to determine that dispute in deciding whether the summary proceeding lies. 11 The issue is whether the subsequent lease to Cohen is a valid lease in the face of the prior lease to Goldfein. The Civil Court has ample power to determine that limited issue (see Matter of Robbins v De Lee, 34 AD2d 870; RPAPL 701, 713, subds 3, 10; CCA 204). The issue in Robbins was whether the defendant was a squatter, premised upon the authority under which he was in possession. The issue here is the same. There plainly is no need for a declaratory judgment. If the Civil Court determines, as it has the power to do, that Goldfein is entitled to possession on the ground that his lease is valid and pre-exists the lease to Cohen, this will dispose of the dispute and the litigation. Similarly, if the court dismisses Goldfein’s action and denies a warrant upon the ground that Cohen is entitled to possession under his lease, there is no need for a declaratory judgment. There is need merely for a determination of which lease is prior. Once that is determined, the relationship between the parties will have been sufficiently established and the legal consequences will automatically follow (Herwick v Stiehl, 68 Mise 2d 850, 852). The Civil Court facilities are designed for resolution of such disputes and are preferable. Summary proceedings are not to be stayed or removed and consolidated in such circumstances (LunFar Co. v Aylesbury Assoc., 40 AD2d 794; see Klausner v Frank, 95 AD2d 653). U It does not matter whether this action preceded the Civil Court proceeding in time. Nor should both actions continue (Seaboard Sur.

       "       'text': 'OPINION OF THE COURT\\nMemorandum.\\nOrder affirmed without costs.\\nPlaintiff instituted this action by service of a summons and complaint dated August 8, 1996 for personal injuries sustained on July 9, 1995 as a result of a slip and fall in front of and/or adjacent to defendants’ premises. Following the filing of a notice of trial, the case was placed on the trial calendar. The case last appeared on the trial calendar on May 31, 2001. At that time, due to the default of plaintiffs counsel in appearing, the case was marked off the calendar. After more than two years had passed, defendants, by notices of motion and cross motion, moved for dismissal pursuant to CPLR 3404. Plaintiffs opposed the motion on the ground, in effect, of law office failure. The lower court, relying on CPLR 3404, granted the motions.\\nCPLR 3404 provides that cases in the Supreme Court or the County Court, marked off or stricken from the calendar, shall be deemed abandoned and shall be dismissed if not restored within one year. In a series of cases, this court has held that the express language of CPLR 3404, limiting its applicability to cases in the Supreme Court and County Court, precludes its application in Civil Court cases (e.g. Hercules v City of New York, 5 Misc 3d 129[A], 2004 NY Slip Op 51282[U] [2004]; Rodriguez v City of New York, 3 Misc 3d 136[A], 2004 NY Slip Op 50501[U] [2004]; Nanadakis v Batista, 2003 NY Slip Op 50706[U] [2003]; Julius Feldman, M.D., PC. v Allstate Ins. Co., 192 Misc 2d 43, 44 [2002]; LoFredo v CMC Occupational Health Servs., 189 Misc 2d 781 [2001]; Lang v Wall St. Mtge. Bankers, Ltd., NYLJ, June 10, 1999, at 32, col 1; Sanusi v City of New York, NYLJ, Nov. 25, 1997, at 27, col 6).\\nUpon further consideration, it is our view that although CPLR 3404 makes reference only to the Supreme Court and County Court, said provision may find application in the lower courts through the general provision of their court acts adopting the CPLR for matters not otherwise addressed (see Siegel, NY Prac § 376, at 633-634 [4th ed]). The New York City Civil Court Act (like the other lower court acts) contains such a provision (CCA 2102) which provides that “[t]he CPLR and other provisions of law relating to practice and procedure in the supreme court, notwithstanding reference by name or classification therein to any other court, should apply in this court as far as the same can be made applicable and are not in conflict with this act” (emphasis added). Indeed, the Appellate Division, Second Department, has implicitly approved of the application of CPLR 3404 in the Civil Court (see Gonzalez v First Natl. Supermarket, 232 AD2d 609 [1996], revg NYLJ, July 5, 1995, at 29, col 2 [App Term, 2d & 11th Jud Dists]). In Gonzalez, this court affirmed an order of the Civil Court, Kings County, which vacated a CPLR 3404 dismissal and restored the matter to the trial calendar. In reversing, the Appellate Division held that while the Civil Court, in a proper exercise of discretion, may grant a motion to vacate a dismissal pursuant to CPLR 3404, it may do so only if the plaintiff carries his affirmative burden of establishing that a meritorious cause of action exists, that there was a reasonable excuse for the delay, that there was no intent to abandon the action and that there was no prejudice to defendant, and that the plaintiff therein had failed to meet said burden.\\nAccordingly, we now hold that CPLR 3404 is applicable to the Civil Court of the City of New York (see CCA 2102; see also Gonzalez v First Natl. Supermarket, 232 AD2d 609 [1996], supra; Siegel, NY Prac § 376, at 638-639 [4th ed]). To the extent that our prior holdings are contrary hereto, we no longer follow them.\\nSince plaintiffs opposition papers fail to set forth merit to their cause of action or a reasonable excuse for the delay, the defendants’ respective motion and cross motion to dismiss the complaint were properly granted.\\nPatterson, J., dissents and votes to reverse the order dismissing the complaint, reinstate the complaint and remand the matter for all further proceedings in the following memorandum. In a remarkable departure from precedent, the majority today overrules our decision in LoFredo v CMC Occupational Health Servs. (189 Misc 2d 781 [App Term, 2d & 11th Jud Dists 2001]) and its progeny, and extends the application of CPLR 3404 to Civil Court cases. Because such an extension is inconsistent with the plain wording of the statute as well as our prior holdings, I respectfully dissent.\\nBackground\\nPlaintiff commenced the instant personal injury action in August 1998 and on May 31, 2001 the matter was marked off the trial calendar due to the nonappearance of plaintiffs’ counsel. Two years later, defendants moved and cross-moved for an order pursuant to CPLR 3404 dismissing the complaint. Defendants noted that more than one year had elapsed since the case had been marked off and that plaintiff had made no attempt to restore it. Plaintiff opposed the motion on the ground that the matter had been stayed as a result of the death of plaintiff Cesar Chavez. Although an order was entered on September 29, 2000 permitting substitution, plaintiff believed that the action remained “stayed” as opposed to being “marked off” the trial calendar.\\nBy order dated April 1, 2004, the court below granted defendants’ motion and cross motion dismissing the action. In doing so, the court cited CPLR 3404 and noted that since 2001 the case remained marked off the calendar and plaintiff took no steps to restore it.\\nPlaintiff now appeal, arguing, among other things, that CPLR 3404 does not extend to Civil Court cases. In light of this court’s decision in LoFredo (189 Misc 2d 781 [2001], supra), which holds that CPLR 3404 is inapplicable to Civil Court actions, as well as the plain wording of CPLR 3404, I agree.\\nAnalysis\\nIn interpreting statutes, courts must first look to the statutory language (see Majewski v Broadalbin-Perth Cent. School Dist., 91 NY2d 577, 583 [1998]). If the meaning of a statute is clear as written, then courts generally may not look beyond that language to ascertain legislative intent (see McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes § 76).\\nHere, the Legislature’s choice of words could not be clearer. CPLR 3404 states, in relevant part, that: “A case in the supreme court or a county court marked ‘off or struck from the calendar or unanswered on a clerk’s calendar call, and not restored within one year thereafter, shall be deemed abandoned and shall be dismissed without costs for neglect to prosecute” (emphasis added). Conspicuously absent from the statutory language is any reference to Civil Court.\\nDespite the statute’s plain wording limiting its application to Supreme Court and County Court cases, the majority concludes that CPLR 3404 applies to Civil Court cases through New York City Civil Court Act § 2102. That statute provides that “notwithstanding any reference by name or classification therein to any other court,” the CPLR shall apply to Civil Court as long as it “can be made applicable and [is] not in conflict with this act” (CCA 2102 [emphasis added]). In my opinion, because CPLR 3404 does conflict with a provision of the Civil Court Act, namely, Uniform Rules for the New York City Civil Court (22 NYCRR) § 208.14 (c), its application does not extend to Civil Court cases.\\nAlthough section 208.14 (c), like CPLR 3404, has a one-year provision for restoring cases, it contains no similar provision for an automatic dismissal. Indeed, section 208.14 (c) replaced Uniform Rules for the New York City Civil Court (22 NYCRR) former § 2900.17 which had provided for automatic dismissal:\\n“A cause marked off or stricken from a Reserve Calendar, a Pre-Trial Calendar, or a Day Calendar, and returned to the General Calendar, shall be deemed abandoned and the complaint and counterclaim, if any, shall be dismissed with statutory costs for failure to prosecute, unless application to restore shall be made within one year from the date of such marking and such application is granted” (22 NYCRR former 2900.17 [emphasis added]).\\nThe fact that section 208.14 (c), unlike its predecessor and unlike CPLR 3404, contains no provision for automatic dismissal further supports the conclusion that such a provision was never intended to apply to Civil Court (see Sanusi v City of New York, NYLJ, Nov. 25, 1997, at 27, col 6 [App Term, 2d & 11th Jud Dists]).\\nTo the extent the majority contends that the Appellate Division, Second Department, in Gonzalez v First Natl. Supermarket (232 AD2d 609 [1996]) has “implicitly approved” the extension of CPLR 3404 to Civil Court cases, I disagree. Nothing in the decision holds that CPLR 3404 applies to Civil Court cases and I will not presume such a holding based on the Appellate Division’s silence on the issue. Because the application of CPLR 3404 to Civil Court cases was never squarely presented in Gonzalez, the majority’s reliance on Gonzalez is misplaced.\\nAccordingly, I adhere to this court’s prior decisions which hold that CPLR 3404 authorizes automatic dismissal for want of prosecution in Supreme Court and County Court cases only, not Civil Court cases (see Hercules v City of New York, 5 Misc 3d 129[A], 2004 NY Slip Op 51282[U] [2004]; Rodriguez v City of New York, 3 Misc 3d 136[A], 2004 NY Slip Op 50501[U] [2004]; Nanadakis v Batista, 2003 NY Slip Op 50706[U] [2003]; Julius Feldman, M.D., P.C. v Allstate Ins. Co., 192 Misc 2d 43, 44 [2002]; LoFredo v CMC Occupational Health Servs., 189 Misc 2d 781 [2001], supra; Lang v Wall St. Mtge. Bankers, Ltd., NYLJ, June 10, 1999, at 32, col 1; Sanusi v City of New York, supra). Thus, defendants here could not avail themselves of CPLR 3404 and the court below erred in dismissing the case on this basis.\\nFinally, it should be noted that in Civil Court cases the only statutory authority for dismissal for want of prosecution is CPLR 3216. That statute provides, in part, that before moving to dismiss a complaint for failure to prosecute, a defendant must serve plaintiff with a written demand to serve and file a note of issue within 90 days of receipt of the demand. Absent such a demand, a court is without authority to dismiss an action for general delay (see Chase v Scavuzzo, 87 NY2d 228, 233 [1995]). Indeed,\\n“the inherent power and practice of the courts in controlling the flow of litigation by dismissing neglected actions . . . has been abrogated by [CPLR 3216], with the result that courts do not possess the power to dismiss an action for general delay where plaintiff has not been served with a 90-day demand to serve and file a note of issue pursuant to CPLR 3216 (b)” (Arcate v Cohen, 289 AD2d 148, 149 [1st Dept 2001] [internal quotation marks omitted]; see also Cohn v Borchard Affiliations, 25 NY2d 237 [1969]).\\nHere, the striking of the case from the trial calendar effectively nullified the notice of trial, returning the case to its pretrial status and subjecting it to a possible dismissal under CPLR 3216 (see DeCook v Bruno G.M.C. Truck Sales Corp., 193 Misc 2d 572, 573 [App Term, 2d & 11th Jud Dists 2002]). However, no 90-day demand was served nor did plaintiff move to restore the case. Thus, the case simply remained marked off the calendar and no basis existed to dismiss it. While I recognize that such a holding could allow a case to remain marked off the calendar indefinitely until a 90-day demand is served, it is for the Legislature, not the courts, to address the issue. Accordingly, I would vote to reverse the order below.\\nPesce, PJ., and Golia, J., concur; Patterson, J., dissents in a separate memorandum.\\n*\\nCivil Court rules “shall be construed as consistent with the New York City Civil Court Act” (22 NYCRR 208.1 [d]). Thus, any statute inconsistent with a Civil Court rule is likewise inconsistent with the act.',\n",

       "       'text': 'OPINION OF THE COURT\\nMartin B. Stecher, J.\\nIn this declaratory judgment action, plaintiff moves to enjoin defendant from pursuing a summary proceeding in Civil Court, or, in the alternative, seeks an order removing the Civil Court proceeding and consolidating it with the action pending before this court.\\nBy letter dated December 17, 1987, defendant rejected an éarlier attempt by plaintiff to exercise a renewal option contained in the lease on a store, and demanded that plaintiff vacate the premises by December 31, 1987, the terminal date of the lease.\\nOn Janaury 5, 1988, a holdover proceeding was commenced in Civil Court; but prior thereto, on or about December 30, 1987, plaintiff commenced a declaratory judgment action in Supreme Court seeking a declaration that he properly exercised his option to renew; or, alternatively, a declaration \"based on the Court’s power in equity to relieve against forfeitures of valuable leaseholds,” that plaintiff’s belated exercise of the option to renew does not bar plaintiff from further occupancy and possession.\\nDefendant argues that all of the issues between these parties can, and should, be resolved in Civil Court. A Civil Court holdover proceeding, it is contended, is the most expeditious manner of resolving the parties-’ disputes, and plaintiff can raise, as equitable defenses, any demand he may make here for equitable relief. To grant the relief sought by the plaintiff, it is asserted, would permit tenants to evade summary proceedings in\\' Civil Court and, by virtue of Supreme Court’s substantial Trial Calendar, obtain a de facto extension of leases.\\nIt is well settled that Civil Court has jurisdiction over landlord-tenant disputes encompassed in summary proceedings and that when it has the power to decide the dispute, it is desirable that it should do so (Post v 120 E. End Ave. Corp., 62 NY2d 19, 28; Lun Far Co. v Aylesbury Assocs., 40 AD2d 794).\\nIn this case, there is no doubt that Civil Court can grant the parties the reality of full relief, even though it may not issue a declaratory judgment.\\nNY Constitution, article VI, § 15 (b) gave the Civil Court \"such equity jurisdiction as may be provided by law,” and the Legislature authorized Civil Court to hear equitable defenses (CCA 905). There is no question that the tenant’s claim may be asserted as an equitable defense.\\nIn one leading case where a tenant sought to excuse its delay in exercising an option to renew, the Civil Court upheld tenant’s equitable defense to eviction. The Appellate Term affirmed, the Appellate Division reversed and the Court of Appeals, finding possible merit to the equitable defense, reversed, and granted a new trial (J. N. A. Realty Corp. v Cross Bay Chelsea, 42 NY2d 392, revg 52 AD2d 617, mot for clarification of remittitur denied 44 NY2d 837). Civil Court’s jurisdiction to grant such equitable relief is unchallenged by the published decisions in the J. N. A. case (see also, 5700, 5800, 5900 Arlington Ave. Assoc, v Dogan, 135 Misc 2d 338, 340).\\nIn a recently reported case, the Appellate Division, First Department, in reversing an Appellate Term order, which affirmed a Civil Court judgment dismissing a landlord’s holdover proceeding, held that the case was not one in which equity should intervene to relieve tenant of his obligations under the lease (Soho Dev. Corp. v Dean & DeLuca, 131 AD2d 385), but there is no challenge to the jurisdiction of the Housing Court to grant such equitable relief by excusing a default. As in this case, the tenant commenced a Supreme Court declaratory judgment action and sought to dismiss landlord’s holdover proceeding on the ground that another action was pending. This court (Lehner, J.) denied the motion \"ruling that the Civil Court had the power to relieve the tenant of its failure to timely exercise its option” (supra, at 385-386).\\nThe assertion by tenant of its right to a renewal lease arises in Civil Court as a defense to the summary holdover proceeding, and may not result, in that court, in a declaratory judgment. But all of the issues to be heard in the declaratory judgment action will be resolved in the holdover proceeding; and if a declaratory judgment is still desired, it will be available for the asking (on motion), after the summary proceeding is resolved, as a matter of issue preclusion.\\nTo be sure it has often been said that two proceedings are to be avoided where one will do; but, here, there will be but one litigated proceeding and the policy of the courts to preserve Civil Court’s landlord and tenant jurisdiction will be upheld.\\nAccordingly, an order shall be settled denying the relief requested, vacating any prior restraint which may have issued and staying all further proceedings in this action (except to appeal the order) pending resolution of the summary proceeding.',\n",

       "       'text': 'OPINION OF THE COURT\\nMemorandum.\\nOrdered that the order, insofar as appealed from, is reversed without costs and defendants’ motion for summary judgment is dismissed.\\nPlaintiffs are four residents of the Lakeside Manor Home for Adults (Lakeside Manor), a private proprietary adult-care facility. In their complaint, plaintiffs alleged that, based on the number of residents at Lakeside Manor, and pursuant to implementing regulations of Social Services Law § 461-d set forth in 18 NYCRR 487.11 (1) (15), Lakeside Manor had an insufficient number of public telephones at its facility, that plaintiffs had been wrongfully charged to dial toll-free telephone numbers from the public telephones, that access on the public telephones had been blocked to certain telephone numbers, and that, as a result of the insufficient number of telephones, plaintiffs had been hampered in their ability to communicate privately with friends, family members, attorneys, financial institutions, and various service and alternative housing providers. Plaintiffs alleged causes of action for breach of their contracts of admission to Lakeside Manor, breach of the warranty of habitability, violation of the antidiscrimination provisions of the federal Fair Housing Act (42 USC § 3604 [f] [2]), and violation of the Social Services Law. The complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief as well as monetary damages in connection with each cause of action. The action was commenced in Supreme Court, Richmond County. After granting preliminary injunctive relief, the Supreme Court transferred the action to the Civil Court, Richmond County, pursuant to CPLR 325 (d).\\nIn the Civil Court, following the completion of pretrial disclosure, defendants moved for summary judgment dismissing the case, and plaintiffs cross-moved for summary judgment on all their causes of action. The Civil Court denied both the mo tion and the cross motion, and defendants appeal from so much of the order as denied their motion for summary judgment. We reverse the Civil Court’s order, insofar as appealed from, and dismiss the motion, upon a finding that the Civil Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over this action.\\nCPLR 325 (d) authorizes the removal of cases from Supreme Court to the Civil Court, provided that the Civil Court would have had jurisdiction but for the amount of damages demanded. “The Civil Court is a court of limited jurisdiction, possessing only that subject matter jurisdiction provided by law (see NY Const, art VI, § 15)” (Washington v Culotta, 13 Misc 3d 18, 21 [App Term, 2d & 11th Jud Dists 2006]; accord Fuca v City of New York, 15 Misc 3d 86, 87 [App Term, 2d & 11th Jud Dists 2007]; O’Neil v City of New York, 10 Misc 3d 30 [App Term, 2d & 11th Jud Dists 2005]). An order “transferring down” an action from Supreme Court to Civil Court pursuant to CPLR 325 (d) does not confer subject matter jurisdiction on the Civil Court (Priel v Linarello, 7 Misc 3d 64, 66 [App Term, 2d & 11th Jud Dists 2005], affd 44 AD3d 835 [2007]) other than permitting a monetary award greater than that limited by the New York City Civil Court Act (see CCA art 2).\\n“ ‘Except for proceedings for the enforcement of housing standards (CCA 110 [a] [4]; 203 [o]) and applications for certain provisional remedies (CCA 209 [b]), the New York City Civil Court may not grant injunctive relief ” (Topaz Realty Corp. v Morales, 9 Misc 3d 27, 28 [App Term, 2d & 11th Jud Dists 2005], quoting Broome Realty Assoc. v Sek Wing Eng, 182 Misc 2d 917, 918 [App Term, 1st Dept 1999]; see also 19 W. 45th St. Realty Co. v Doram Elec. Corp., 233 AD2d 184 [1996]; Bank of N.Y. v Irwin Intl. Imports, 197 AD2d 462 [1993]). Since the alleged deprivation does not violate the Housing Maintenance Code (Administrative Code of City of NY, tit 27, ch 2) or otherwise implicate housing standards, the Civil Court was not authorized to grant the injunctive relief sought.\\nHere, although the complaint sought monetary damages, it primarily sought declaratory and injunctive relief, which the Civil Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to grant. This court’s authority is merely to rule on the validity of the Civil Court’s order, not to reverse the Supreme Court’s CPLR 325 (d) transfer order (see Priel v Linarello, 7 Misc 3d 64 [2005]; Rivera v Buck, 25 Misc 3d 27 [App Term, 2d, 11th & 13th Jud Dists 2009]; Briscoe v White, 8 Misc 3d 1 [App Term, 9th & 10th Jud Dists 2004]; but see Kaminsky v Connolly, 73 Miscc 2d 789 [App Term, 1st Dept 1972]). Accordingly, the order of the Civil Court, insofar as appealed from, is reversed and defendants’ motion for summary judgment is dismissed.\\nWe note that the disposition herein is without prejudice to an application in Supreme Court for re-transfer of the action to that court (see generally Zuckermann v Spector, 287 AD2d 402 [2001]).\\nRios, J.E, Pesce and Golia, JJ., concur.',\n",

       "       'text': 'John A. Monteleone, J.\\nIn this article 78 proceeding for a writ of prohibition, petitioner seeks an order directing respondent, Norman H. Shilling, Judge of the Civil Court of the City of New York, to cease further proceedings in a matter now before him entitled City of New York (PVB) against Stephen F. Browne.\\nA brief review of the facts is required in order to properly address the issues presented herein.\\nSix parking violation summonses were issued against respondent Browne’s vehicle. When Browne failed to pay the tickets or otherwise answer or appear in response to the summonses, two default judgments were rendered by the Parking Violations Bureau (PVB) pursuant to article 2-B of the Vehicle and Traffic Law (§ 241, subd 2) and chapter 40 of the New York City Administrative Code (§ 883a-7.0, subd b). (At this point, the court notes that chapter 40 of the New York City Administrative Code, which was enacted first, is substantially in conformance with article 2-B of the Vehicle and Traffic Law.) Browne failed to pursue the remedies available to him for avoiding or vacating the default judgment as provided in subdivision 2 of section 241 and section 242 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law and subdivision b of section 883a-7.0 and section 883a-8.0 of the Administrative Code. Instead, he moved in the Civil Court by order to show cause \"restraining the Parking Violations Bureau from enforcing their [default] judgment dated March 20, 1975 against the defendant [Browne] for parking violations, pending a review to be heard before said Parking Violations Bureau and to determine the legality and constitutionality of the procedures of the Parking Violations Bureau, and to determine the facts in this matter.”\\nThe order to show cause came on to be heard before Judge Shilling, who denied the PVB’s motion to have it dismissed on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction of the Civil Court. Judge Shilling signed the order and directed that a hearing be held on the matter commencing on September 23, 1976. On the second day of the hearing, September 24, the PVB brought on the instant order to show cause for a writ of prohibition, and Judge Shilling was stayed from proceeding further.\\nThe issues involved are twofold: (1) does Judge Shilling, as a Judge of the Civil Court, have jurisdiction over the matter before him; and (2) in the event it is found that he does not have jurisdiction, may and should this court issue a writ of prohibition restraining him from proceeding further?\\nTo properly resolve the first of these questions, the court must initially determine the nature of the relief sought by Browne in his order to show cause. The answer is not readily discernible from the order itself and even Judge Shilling, at one point during the course of the hearing, stated: \"I haven’t even gotten into anything in my own mind as to where we are going on this particular motion. I don’t want to prejudice my thinking.” Nevertheless, other comments and statements for the record, made by Judge Shilling, along with the previously quoted language of the order to show cause, sufficiently reveal that the order partakes of three alternative types of relief: (a) vacating the default judgment; (b) judicially reviewing the default judgment; and (c) determining the constitutionality of the PVB and the procedures followed by them.\\nAs to each of the relief, this court will now consider seriatim whether the Civil Court has jurisdiction.\\nVACATING THE PVB DEFAULT JUDGMENT\\nStatutory authority for vacating a default judgment in general is found in CPLR 5015 (subd [a]) (Levine v Berlin, 46 AD2d 902; Brenner v Arterial Plaza, 29 AD2d 815; 5 Weinstein-Korn-Miller, NY Civ Prac, par 5015.04), which provides in part as follows:\\n\"Rule 5015. Relief from judgment or order.\\n\"(a) On motion. The court which rendered a judgment or order may relieve a party from it upon such terms as may be just, on motion of any interested person with such notice as the court may direct, upon the ground of:\\n\"1. excusable default” (emphasis added). In addition, a court has inherent power, not limited by the provisions of CPLR 5015, to set aside a default judgment in the interests of justice (Ladd v Stevenson, 112 NY 325, 332; Michaud v Loblaws, 36 AD2d 1013; 5 Weinstein-Korn-Miller, NY Civ Prac, par 5015.12).\\nBut whether the court is exercising its inherent power or that pursuant to the statute, it is clear that it may do so only with respect to its own judgments (Michaud v Loblaws, supra). As was said in Michaud (p 1014) in describing a court’s inherent power: \"Courts have control over their own proceedings, and in its exercise may open their own judgments for sufficient reason and in the furtherance of justice [citation omitted].” Likewise, CPLR 5015 subd [a] expressly provides that only the court which rendered the judgment may relieve a party from a default (see emphasized language quoted, supra). (Levine v Berlin, 46 AD2d 902, supra; Brenner v Arterial Plaza, 29 AD2d 815, 816, supra.)\\nUnder these principles of law, therefore, Judge Shilling would have no authority to vacate a Parking Violations Bureau default judgment unless said judgment can be regarded as having been rendered or granted in the Civil Court. Is a Parking Violations Bureau judgment a Civil Court judgment?\\nThe Parking Violations Bureau in the City of New York is an administrative agency created by legislative fiat in 1969 (L 1969, ch 1075, amdg § 155 of Vehicle and Traffic Law and adding title A — Parking Violations Bureau — to ch 40 of the Administrative Code of City of New York, § 883a-1.0 et seq.). The reasons for its enactment and that of the companion legislation relating to moving violations (L 1969, ch 1074, adding art 2-A to Vehicle and Traffic Law, § 225 et seq.) were to decriminalize most traffic infractions in New York City; remove them from the jurisdiction of the overcrowded Criminal Courts in the city, and transfer the adjudication of these violations to administrative agencies where only monetary penalties could be levied (Matter of Rosenthal v Hartnett, 36 NY2d 269, which upheld the constitutionality of art 2-A of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, transferring the cognizance of traffic infractions to an administrative agency; Statement of Findings and Purposes, L 1969, ch 1074, § 1; Governor’s Memoranda, NY Legis Ann, 1969, pp 456, 480).\\nNowhere in this legislative history or within the purview of the statute itself is there any indication that the Parking Violations Bureau was to become an arm of the Civil Court or under its jurisdiction. Rather, the agency’s relationship to the courts was succinctly described in the Governor’s Memoranda (supra) as follows:\\n\"The overwhelming majority of traffic cases, involving both moving and parking violations, will be removed from the courts * * *\\n\"Under these bills, the rights of motorists will be fully safeguarded by appropriate administrative procedures. An administrative appeal will be provided for both parking and moving violations. Beyond that, an appeal to the Supreme Court under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules also will be authorized.”\\nNotwithstanding this well-documented legislative background, respondents maintain that a judgment of the PVB is a Civil Court judgment. Their arguments are twofold: (1) the judgment is entered in the Civil Court pursuant to section 241 (subd 2, par [3]) of the Vehicle and Traffic Law; and (2) the judgment is enforced and executed upon as though it were a Civil Court judgment.\\nTo respond to these claims in the context of the instant motion, the court must first turn back to the requirement of CPLR 5015, that only the court which rendered a judgment may relieve a party from it. \"To render a judgment” is defined as: \"To pronounce, state, declare or announce the judgment of the court in a given case * * * and [is] not synonymous with \\'entering,’ \\'docketing’ or \\'recording’ the judgment” (Black’s Law Dictionary [4th ed]).\\nThe rendition of a judgment is a judicial act of the court, while the entry of the judgment is simply the ministerial act of the clerk in recording it as evidence of the judgment (Vogel v Edwards, 283 NY 118, 121; Dowling v Stephan, 206 Misc 518, 522). The judicial functions of the court are completed when it has rendered its judgment (Vogel v Edwards, supra).\\nCan it be said that the Civil Court renders the judgment in parking violation cases? An affirmative answer would run contrary to the objectives of the legislative creation of the Parking Violations Bureau, giving it exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate all parking violation cases. Moreover, the clear wording of the statutes leaves the adjudication, whether it be a default judgment or a determination on the charges, to the administrative agency or its personnel therein (Administrative Code of City of New York, §§ 883a-7.0 and 883a-8.0; Vehicle and Traffic Law, §§ 241 and 242). At no step of this administrative process is there any provision for Civil Court adjudication, or, to put it another way, the Civil Court performs no judicial function in the rendering of the judgment (Dieffenbach v Roch, 112 NY 621, 626; Quackenbush v Johnston, 249 App Div 452, 454). The Civil Court’s sole involvement is to serve as the court in which the judgment is to be entered, after the judgment has been rendered by the Parking Violations Bureau (Vehicle and Traffic Law, § 241, subd [2]). To further divorce the Civil Court from any role in the adjudication process, the statutes even provide that resort shall be had to the Supreme Court in the case of the refusal of a witness to obey a subpoena (Administrative Code of City of New York, § 883-6.0, subd [5]; Vehicle and Traffic Law, § 240, subd 2, par e).\\nFinally, in this regard, the Civil Court of the City of New York is a court of limited jurisdiction, whose authority is circumscribed by the New York State Constitution (art VI, § 15, subd b). The Constitution does not give the court any jurisdiction to hear and determine parking violations, nor does the Civil Court Act, enacted pursuant thereto, confer any such authority (see CCA, art 2, § 201 et seq).\\nConsequently, it must be concluded that a default judgment of the PVB is a judgment rendered exclusively by that administrative agency and not by the Civil Court, and, further, that it was never meant to be nor does it ever become a judgment of the Civil Court. The subsequent entry of the judgment in the Civil Court does not make it a Civil Court judgment (see Tower Sales Corp. v Byrd, 46 Misc 2d 1041, 1042); nor does its filing there give the Civil Court jurisdiction to consider an application to vacate the default judgment (Brenner v Arterial Plaza, 29 AD2d 815, 816, supra; Weichert v Kirnie, 16 AD2d 744; Lintern v Lintern, 58 Misc 2d 335; Tower Sales Corp. v Byrd, supra). The docketing of the judgment merely provides an aid to the enforcement or collection of the original judgment rendered by the PVB (Brenner v Arterial Plaza, supra; Quackenbush v Johnston, 249 App Div 452, 454, supra; Lin-tern v Lintern, supra). Likewise, the execution of the judgment through the Civil Court serves the same purpose and does not relate to the rendering of the judgment. Thus, contrary to respondent’s assertion, these factors do not convert a PVB judgment into a Civil Court judgment.\\nThese conclusions are consistent with the position of the Civil Court as reflected in a directive to Judges and clerks, dated August 31, 1972, issued by Administrative Judge Thompson re motions pertaining to Parking Violations Bureau (PVB). The directive begins by stating that \"Orders to show cause concerning any judgment sought or obtained by the Parking Violations Bureau (PVB) shall not be signed”, and concludes with this paragraph: \"Do not be misled by the fact that the papers presented to you may recite that the PVB judgment in question was or will be entered in the Civil Court. Such entry is pro forma and only designed to allow levy and execution by City Marshals and for no other purpose. As such they are not judgments of this court.” (Emphasis added.)\\nWhile Judge Thompson’s directive does not necessarily have the force of law, it correctly portrays the status of a PVB judgment and the fact that it is not a judgment of the Civil Court. To hold otherwise would emasculate the intent of the Legislature in creating the PVB and removing parking violations from the primary jurisdiction of the courts.\\nThus, if a PVB judgment is not a judgment of the court in the first instance and does not become one by virtue of its entry or execution in the Civil Court, then the inescapable conclusion is that the Civil Court is without statutory or inherent powers to vacate a default judgment of the PVB. Accordingly, Judge Shilling acted without jurisdiction in signing the order to show cause and hearing a matter pertaining to the vacatur of a default judgment of the PVB.\\nJUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE PVB DEFAULT JUDGMENT\\nBy express statutory provision, the final determinations of the PVB, which would encompass default judgments at an earlier step, are subject to judicial review pursuant to CPLR article 78 (Administrative Code of City of New York, § 883a-9.0; Vehicle and Traffic Law, § 243). An article 78 proceeding must, however, be brought in the Supreme Court (CPLR 7804, subd [b]; Pressley v Foote, 355 NYS2d 829; Matter of Sovocool v David, 7 AD2d 262, 266). The Civil Court has no jurisdiction to grant article 78 relief Matter of Anonymous, 57 Misc 2d 813).\\nAccordingly, Judge Shilling has no authority to review a determination (i.e., the default judgment herein) of the PVB.\\nIt is unnecessary for this court to pass on the question of whether even a properly instituted article 78 proceeding in the Supreme Court would have entitled respondent Browne to any relief, inasmuch as the respondent failed to pursue his administrative remedies as provided by statute (Administrative Code of City of New York, §§ 883a-7.0, 883a-8.0; Vehicle and Traffic Law, §§ 241, 242).\\nDETERMINING THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE PVB\\nThe nature, of the hearing thus far had before Judge Shilling clearly reveals that, in response to the relief requested by respondent Browne in his order to show cause, Judge Shilling was examining into the constitutionality of the legislation creating the PVB. And notwithstanding Judge Shilling\\'s declaration to the contrary, this court finds in this regard that he was conducting the matter as though it were an action for a declaratory judgment, which is the appropriate procedure to adjudicate the constitutional validity of a statute and the procedures pursuant thereto (Town of Babylon v Conte, 61 Misc 2d 626, 627-628).\\nJurisdiction over declaratory judgment actions has been vested exclusively in the Supreme Court (CPLR 3001; New York Post Corp. v Kelley, 296 NY 178, 188; Town of Babylon v Conte, supra, p 628). A lower court of limited jurisdiction (such as the Civil Court) has no authority to render a declaratory judgment (Town of Babylon v Conte, supra, p 628; 3 Weinstein-Korn-Miller, NY Civ Prac, par 3001.11).\\nSection 212 of the CCA which provides, \"In the exercise of its jurisdiction the court shall have all of the powers that the supreme court would have in like actions and proceedings” cannot be availed of to give the Civil Court the requisite jurisdiction. That section does not expand the jurisdiction of the court so as to confer upon it equitable powers not expressly granted elsewhere (Rottenberg v Cirillo, 58 Misc 2d 309). Rather, the powers referred to are incidental, and not primary, to the exercise of proper jurisdiction, viz., the comparable powers of the Supreme Court are exercisable by the Civil Court only in those cases over which the Civil Court can exercise jurisdiction in the first instance (Kwoczka v Dry Dock Sav. Bank, 52 Misc 2d 67, 71-72; 3 Weinstein-Korn-Miller, NY Civ Prac, par 3001.11). A declaratory judgment is not such a case.\\nAccordingly, under the circumstances of the order to show cause presented to Judge Shilling by respondent Browne, Judge Shilling has no jurisdiction to hear and determine the constitutionality of the PVB.\\nWRIT OF PROHIBITION\\nAn article 78 (CPLR) proceeding in the nature of prohibition is designed to prevent an inferior court from proceeding with a judicial matter over which it has no jurisdiction or to prevent it from exceeding its authorized powers in a case over which it has jurisdiction in the first instance (Matter of Lee v County Ct. of Erie County, 27 NY2d 432, 436-437). Prohibition is an extraordinary remedy issued in the sound discretion of the court where the grievance cannot be redressed by ordinary proceedings at law or in equity (Matter of Hogan v Court of Gen. Sessions, 296 NY 1, 8; Matter of Roberts v County Ct. of Wyoming County, 39 AD2d 246, 248, affd 34 NY2d 246). Furthermore, a writ of prohibition is not usually available if there be an adequate remedy by way of appeal (Matter of Lee v County Ct. of Erie County, supra, p 437; Matter of Roberts v County Ct. of Wyoming County, 34 NY2d 246, 249, supra). Nevertheless, where the lower court is exceeding its jurisdiction and the writ furnishes a more effective remedy, it may be availed of even though the error might be corrected by appeal (Lee v County Ct. of Erie County, supra, p 437).\\nThe case at bar comes well within this last stated principle. As this court has found, Judge Shilling is exceeding his authority as a Civil Court Judge by acting in a matter over which the Civil Court has no jurisdiction. The proceeding before him has already resulted in a transcript of nearly 200 pages. More witnesses, involving an unnecessary expense and burden on their time as well as on that of the court and the parties, are anticipated, all of which will be for naught (see Matter of Culver Contr. Corp. v Humphrey, 268 NY 26, 40). Judge Shilling has no power to vacate or review the PVB default judgment or determine the constitutionality of the enabling legislation. Consequently, this court concludes that it would be abusing its discretion herein if it were to permit Judge Shilling to continue his unauthorized proceeding simply because an appeal is available to the PVB at the conclusion of the hearing and after the Judge’s determination therein. Under the circumstances of this case, it is far better to prevent the exercise of an unwarranted assumption of jurisdiction than to be driven to the necessity of correcting this usurpation after it has been committed (Milonas v Schwalb, 65 Misc 2d 1042, 1044).\\nAccordingly, petitioner’s motion for a writ of prohibition should be and is granted. Judge Shilling is hereby directed to cease further proceedings in the matter entitled City of New York (PVB) against Stephen F. Browne (Docket No. CC-17238) and to dismiss Browne’s order to show cause as being beyond the jurisdiction of the Civil Court. This decision is without prejudice to Browne pursuing any other remedies properly available to him.',\n",

       "     'head_matter': 'Pabst Brewing Company, Appellant, vs. Milwaukee Lithographing Company, Respondent.\\nMarch 19\\nApril 9, 1914.\\nAppealable orders: Appeal from Milwaukee- civil court: New trial, when to be ordered: “Manifest prejudicial error:\" Landlord and tenant: Notice terminating tenancy from year to year: Form and sufficiency: Nexo tenancy from month to month: Evidence.\\n1. The provision of sec. 3069, Stats., authorizing an appeal from an order of the circuit court granting a new trial, applies to such an order made by the circuit court for Milwaukee county in a case brought there by appeal from the civil court.\\n2. A notice in writing to a tenant from year to year, given on March 26th, to the effect that his.lease expires on April 30th (the end of the rental year) and that from and after the latter date the lessor will consider him a tenant from month to month at a specified increased monthly rental, was sufficient in form, under sec. 2187, Stats., to put an end to the tenancy from year to year.\\n3. Where the tenant, without making any response to such notice, continued to occupy the premises and paid rent at the increased rate, a new tenancy from month to month was created upon the terms of the notice.\\n4. A letter from the lessor to the lessee, written in July following, stating that it had an offer to lease the property for a term of ten years from May 1st of the next year, and asking the intentions of the lessee as to occupying the\\' game after that date, to which the lessee replied that it expected to occupy its new quarters by that date, did not modify the terms of the notice above mentioned nor create a tenancy to said May 1st.\\n5. Within the meaning of the act creating the civil court of Milwaukee county (ch. 549, Laws of 1909), the “manifest prejudicial error” which will justify the circuit court in reversing the judgment of the civil court and ordering a new trial in the circuit court, is sucb error as warrants the supreme court on\\' appeal in reversing the circuit court; and the findings of fact by the civil court should not be set aside unless they are against the clear preponderance of the evidence.\\nAppeal from an order of the circuit court for Milwaukee county: OeeeN T. Williams, Circuit Judge.\\nReversed.\\nAction for unlawful detainer, tried in the civil court of Milwaukee county without a jury, a jury having been waived, where judgment went for the plaintiff, appellant here, and on appeal to the circuit court a new trial was ordered. The appeal here is from the order of the circuit court granting a new trial.\\nThe respondent, Milwaukee Lithographing Companyand its predecessors occupied the premises in question, known as 211-219 Third street in the city of Milwaukee, for many years prior to April, 1906. On April 19, 1906, a lease was made to the respondent by the appellant for a term of two years expiring April 30, 1908, signed on behalf of appellant by C. W. Henning, vice-president, and H. J. Stark, secretary. After the expiration of this lease the respondent occupied the premises as tenant from year to year of the appellant at a rental of $215 per month, payable monthly, the yearly tenancy expiring April 30, 1912. On the 25th day of March, 1912, the appellant mailed the following notice to the respondent:\\n“March 25, 1912.\\n“Milwaukee Lithographing Company,\\n“217-219 Third St, Oity.\\n“Gentlemen: Please take notice that the lease under which you are holding possession of the property known as 217 — 219 Third street expires on the 30th day of April, 1912, and we shall from and after that date consider you as tenants from month to month at the rate of $300 per month.\\n“As you are well aware, the rental value of downtown property has been increased considerable, but as stated above we are willing to have you continue as our tenants at the rate mentioned.\\n“Hoping to hear from you hy return mail as to your intentions the coming year, we are,\\n“Yours very truly,\\n“Pabst Beewing Company,\\n“Eeal Estate Department,\\n“By P. J. M.”\\nThis notice was received by the respondent on the 26th day of March, 1912, to which it made no .reply, but commenced to pay under it $300 per month rent withont dissent, objection, or qualification to the terms stated in such notice. After-wards all formal steps were taken to entitle appellant to possession and to recover in the unlawful detainer action if respondent was its tenant from month to month from and after May 1, 1912.\\nHenry W. Stark, attorney, and James D. Shaw, of counsel, for the appellant.\\nJ. ,W. McMillan and F. F. Oroelle, for the respondent.',\n",

       "       'text': \"Keewin, J.\\nIt is suggested by respondent, though not very strenuously pressed in argument, that the order granting a new trial is not appealable. It is said that the appellant is not aggrieved, because if it has a meritorious cause of action it still has opportunity to substantiate it on a trial in the circuit court.\\nThe right of appeal is statutory, and the question turns on whether see. 3069, Stats., reaches the present order. Sec. 3069 enumerates the appealable orders, and provides that, when an order of the circuit court grants a new trial, such order may be carried to the supreme court by appeal. It may be said that this statute has reference to orders for new trial in cases where the action was brought in the circuit court originally and not to cases carried there by appeal from the civil court. This statute was in force when the act establishing the civil conrt was passed. Its terms are general and apply to all orders for new trial made by the circuit court. We see no reason why it does not cover an order for a new trial made by tbe circuit court iu a case brought there by appeal from the civil court. We think the order is appeal-able. Hanna v. C., M. & St. P. R. Co., post, p. 626, 146 N. W. 878.\\nThe main contention in this court is that there was no monthly tenancy, but on the contrary, when the notice to quit was given, the respondent was holding over as tenant from year to year, or at least until May 1, 1913. It is argued that the notice and service thereof were insufficient. We have set out the notice in the statement of facts. It is brief, but to the point, and we think sufficient under the statute. Sec. 2187, Stats., provides that if a tenant for a year or more shall hold over after the expiration of his term he may, at the election of his landlord, be considered a tenant from year to year upon the terms of the original lease; but that such tenancy may be terminated at the end of any year after, the expiration of said term, by either party to said lease, upon giving to the other party thereto a notice in writing, not less than thirty days prior to the date of such expiration, that he elects to terminate such lease at the end of such year.\\nThe respondent, having remained in possession and commenced paying the increased rent according to the terms of the notice, accepted its terms and became a tenant from month to month, unless the terms of the notice were in some way modified. Williams v. Foss-Armstrong H. Co. 135 Wis. 280, 115 N. W. 803. Counsel for respondent endeavor to distinguish the instant case from Williams v. Foss-Armstrong H. Co., supra, on the ground that the tenancy from month to month mentioned in the notice was modified by evidence which showed a holding over for a year from May 1, 1912. The civil court, however, held to the contrary, and such holding is supported by the evidence.\\nThe main evidence relied upon by respondent under this head is an alleged conversation testified to by Mr. Davis, president of ’ respondent, which he claimed he had on March 26, 1912, with Mr. Stark, an officer of appellant, and two letters, one dated July 26 and tbe other July 30, 1912. Tbe alleged conversation Mr. Stark testified never occurred, and tbe civil court beld that tbe preponderance of tbe evidence showed that it did not occur. Tbe two letters, tbe civil court beld, did not change tbe situation created by tbe notice and payment of rent under it'.\\nCounsel for respondent insists that tbe notice of March 25, 1912, was not sufficient under sec. 2187, Stats. In this we think counsel is mistaken. It plainly, notified respondent that tbe lease expired on April 30, 1912, and that any bolding thereafter would be from month to month at $300 per month. This, when accepted, was sufficient to create a new tenancy on tbe terms of tbe notice.\\nIt is also argued that tbe letters of July 26th and July 30th, before referred to, amounted to an offer and acceptance of a tenancy to May 1, 1913. Tbe civil court was well warranted in finding that these letters did not establish such a contract, or modify tbe terms of tbe tenancy created by the notice of March 25, 1912, and payment of rent under it. Tbe letter of July 26th was written by appellant to respondent informing it that appellant bad an offer to lease tbe property in question for a term of ten years from May 1, 1913, and stating that before making any arrangements it wished to be advised of tbe intentions of tbe respondent as to occupying tbe premises after May 1,1913. Tbe respondent replied by tbe letter of July 30th, saying very briefly that it expected to occupy its new quarters by May following. There is nothing in these letters which modifies tbe terms of tbe notice of March 25th. On the contrary, such correspondence is consistent with a monthly tenancy and offer by appellant to negotiate for another lease.\\nBut it is argued by respondent that tbe evidence offered by it was received for a limited purpose, therefore its rights were prejudiced. We do not so understand the record. We think that the evidence was received and considered by the civil court for-the purpose for which it was offered, and that, considering all the evidence offered in its broadest scope, the civil conrt was justified in its findings and conclusions.\\n- The circuit court reversed the judgment of the civil court and ordered a new trial upon the ground that the respondent did not have a fair trial in the civil court; that there was manifest prejudicial error in the record of the proceedings in the civil court; and that substantial justice cannot otherwise be done. The statute creating the civil court, ch. 549, Laws of 1909, as amended by eh. 425, Laws of 1911,- and ch. 320, Laws, of 1913, sec. 28, sub. 3, provides, in substance, that on appeal from the civil to the circuit court every judgment of the civil court shall be affirmed or modified and affirmed as so modified, unless, by reason of'manifest prejudicial error in the trial of the action in which such judgment was rendered, any party thereto has not had a fair trial in the civil court; but in any such case of mistrial, where substantial justice cannot otherwise be done and the rights, of the parties otherwise protected, the judgment of the civil court shall be reversed, and the action ordered tried in the circuit court. Point is made that the law was changed pending the appeal in this case by ch. 320, Laws of 1913. It will be seen, however,' that the provision allowing a new trial on account of manifest prejudicial error has not been changed, and no change was made by the amendment of 1913 affecting the questions before us on this appeal.\\nWe are convinced that manifest prejudicial error within the meaning of the statute is such error as warrants this court in reversing the circuit court, and that with reference to reversal by the circuit court of judgments of the civil court the same rule which obtains in this court on reversal of circuit court judgments on appeal to this court also obtains; and that 'a new trial shall be ordered by the circuit court only in cases where substantial justice cannot otherwise be done and the rights of the parties otherwise protected, in which case the judgment of tbe civil court shall be reversed and tbe action ordered tried in tbe circuit court. Eder v. Grifka, 149 Wis. 606, 136 N. W. 154; Hanna v. C., M. & St. P. R. Co., post, p. 626, 146 N. W. 878. In tbe case at bar, therefore, tbe court erred in setting aside tbe findings of tbe civil court for tbe reason that such findings were not against tbe clear preponderance of tbe evidence. Tbe findings of fact of tbe civil court, incorporated in its decision, must be regarded as findings of fact here. Duncan v. Duncan, 111 Wis. 75, 86 N. W. 562; Hubbard v. Ferry, 141 Wis. 17, 123 N. W. 142; Clausing v. Jacobs, 147 Wis. 438, 133 N. W. 582. It follows that tbe order appealed from must be reversed.\\nBy the Oourt. — Tbe order of tbe court below reversing tbe judgment of tbe civil court and granting a new trial is reversed, and tbe cause remanded with directions to affirm tbe judgment of tbe civil court.\",\n",

       "       'text': 'In an action, inter alia, to set aside an allegedly fraudulent conveyance, the plaintiff appeals, as limited by his brief, from so much of an order of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Bunyan, J.), dated November 14, 2012, as granted the motion of the defendant 238 Rodney, LLC, and the cross motion of the defendants Miriam Schvimmer and Israel Schvimmer, for, inter alia, certain injunctive relief to the extent of directing him to furnish the defendants with a satisfaction of judgment and general releases pursuant to a settlement agreement, directing a referee to execute the satisfaction of judgment and general releases in the event the plaintiff does not execute those documents, and enjoining him from taking any further action in an action entitled Zanani v Schvimmer, pending in the Civil Court of the City of New York, New York County, under index No. 300232-TSN-06.\\nOrdered that the order is reversed insofar as appealed from, on the law, with one bill of costs payable by the respondents appearing separately and filing separate briefs, the motion and the cross motion are denied in their entirety, and so much of the order as directed the defendants to deposit the sum of $60,000 into escrow is vacated.\\nIn 2001, the plaintiff represented Miriam Schvimmer and Israel Schvimmer in a partition action instituted by them, which was settled after they discharged the plaintiff. In 2005, the plaintiff commenced an action against the Schvimmers in the Supreme Court, New York County, to recover outstanding legal fees owed for his representation of them in the partition action (see Zanani v Schvimmer, 50 AD3d 445 [2008]). The plaintiffs action eventually was transferred from the Supreme Court to the Civil Court of the City of New York, New York County (hereinafter the Civil Court action). While the Civil Court action was pending, the plaintiff commenced this action against the Schvimmers (hereinafter the Schvimmer defendants) and 238 Rodney, LLC (hereinafter 238 Rodney), in the Supreme Court, Kings County (hereinafter the fraudulent conveyance action), pursuant to Debtor and Creditor Law §§ 273-a and 276 to set aside the allegedly fraudulent conveyance of the Schvimmer defendants’ interest in the property which was the subject of the settled partition action.\\nThe plaintiff obtained a judgment against the Schvimmer defendants in the Civil Court action, which was entered on November 13, 2008. Thereafter, the plaintiff served the Schvimmer defendants with a subpoena pursuant to CPLR 5224 seeking disclosure relevant to satisfy the judgment. The Schvimmer defendants’ failure to comply with the subpoena led to a series of orders issued by the Civil Court, holding them in contempt and staying warrants of commitment pending their compliance with the subpoena.\\nIn the fraudulent conveyance action, on December 15, 2010, the plaintiff, the Schvimmer defendants, and 238 Rodney entered into a written settlement agreement, pursuant to which the defendants agreed to pay the plaintiff the total sum of $60,000 in two $30,000 installments in exchange for the plaintiff’s delivery of a stipulation canceling the notice of pendency and a satisfaction of judgment. Before the first installment was due, on December 29, 2010, the plaintiff moved in the Civil Court action to punish the Schvimmer defendants for contempt for failing to comply with the orders in that action staying the warrants of commitment pending their compliance with the postjudgment subpoena and to recover costs and expenses incurred as a result of the Schvimmer defendants’ misconduct in failing to comply with the subpoena and contempt orders. The Schvimmer defendants cross-moved, inter alia, to enjoin the plaintiff from enforcing the judgment in the Civil Court action, arguing that the settlement agreement in the fraudulent conveyance action settled all claims against them in the Civil Court action as well. Meanwhile, the parties to the settlement agreement failed to perform their initial obligations under the agreement.\\nIn an order entered May 11, 2011, the Civil Court, New York County, granted that branch of the plaintiffs motion which was to hold the Schvimmer defendants in contempt and denied the Schvimmer defendants’ cross motion, but it did not address the plaintiffs request for costs and legal fees incurred as a result of the Schvimmer defendants’ misconduct. The plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Term, First Department, from so much of the order as did not grant his request for costs and legal fees. The Schvimmer defendants cross-appealed, arguing again that the settlement agreement settled all of the plaintiffs claims against them. The Appellate Term affirmed the finding of civil contempt against the Schvimmer defendants and the denial of their cross motion, specifically determining that their submissions, including the settlement agreement, “failed to establish that they were relieved of the obligation to comply with the subpoena.” The Appellate Term modified the order appealed from by granting that branch of the plaintiffs motion which was to recover costs and legal fees pursuant to Judiciary Law § 773, and remitted the matter to the Civil Court to determine the costs and fees incurred as a result of the Schvimmer defendants’ contemptuous conduct.\\nThereafter, the plaintiff moved in the Civil Court action for leave to enter judgment against the Schvimmer defendants for costs and legal fees incurred as a result of their contemptuous conduct. Before the return date of the motion, 238 Rodney moved in the Supreme Court in the fraudulent conveyance action, inter alia, to enjoin the plaintiff from taking any action in the Civil Court action, for a declaration that the settlement agreement resolved any and all claims between the parties in both the Civil Court action and the fraudulent conveyance action, and to compel the plaintiff to issue general releases to the Schvimmer defendants and 238 Rodney pursuant to the settlement agreement. The Schvimmer defendants cross-moved, inter alia, for the same relief. The Supreme Court granted the motion and the cross motion to the extent of directing the defendants to place $60,000 in escrow, directing the plaintiff to furnish the defendants with a satisfaction of judgment and general releases, directing a referee to execute these documents on the plaintiffs behalf if he did not, and enjoining the plaintiff from taking any action in the Civil Court action.\\n“The doctrine of collateral estoppel bars relitigation of an issue which has necessarily been decided in a prior action and is determinative of the issues disputed in the present action, provided that there was a full and fair opportunity to contest the decision now alleged to be controlling” (Capellupo v Nassau Health Care Corp., 97 AD3d 619, 621 [2012]; see Tydings v Greenfield, Stein & Senior, LLP, 11 NY3d 195, 199 [2008]). “The party seeking the benefit of collateral estoppel bears the burden of proving that the identical issue was necessarily decided in the prior proceeding, and is decisive of the present action” (City of New York v College Point Sports Assn., Inc., 61 AD3d 33, 42 [2009]; see Buechel v Bain, 97 NY2d 295, 304 [2001]). “The party against whom preclusion is sought bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a full and fair opportunity to contest the prior determination” (City of New York v College Point Sports Assn., Inc., 61 AD3d at 42; see Buechel v Bain, 97 NY2d at 304).\\nHere, the doctrine of collateral estoppel barred the Schvimmer defendants from arguing that the settlement agreement fully resolved any and all issues between the parties in both actions. Thus, they were barred from receiving injunctive relief enjoining the plaintiff from taking further action in the Civil Court action and entering a judgment in that action for the costs and legal fees incurred as a result of their contemptuous conduct. The plaintiff met his burden of establishing that these issues were necessarily determined against the Schvimmer defendants by the Appellate Term on the appeal arising from the Civil Court action, and the Schvimmer defendants failed to demonstrate that they lacked a full and fair opportunity to contest the prior determination..\\nMoreover, 238 Rodney, which was not a party to the Civil Court action, lacked standing to seek any injunctive relief with respect to that action, which was only commenced against the Schvimmer defendants. 238 Rodney had no legally cognizable interest in obtaining a declaration that the settlement agreement fully resolved all issues between the plaintiff and the Schvimmer defendants in the Civil Court action and an injunction precluding the plaintiff from entering a judgment against the Schvimmer defendants in that action for costs and legal fees resulting from the Schvimmer defendants’ contemptuous conduct (see generally Bank of N.Y. v Silverberg, 86 AD3d 274, 279 [2011]; Caprer v Nussbaum, 36 AD3d 176, 182 [2006]).\\nAccordingly, the Supreme Court erred in granting 238 Rodney’s motion and the Schvimmer defendants’ cross motion to the extent of directing the plaintiff to furnish the defendants with a satisfaction of judgment and general releases, directing a referee to execute the satisfaction of judgment and general releases in the event the plaintiff does not execute those documents, and enjoining the plaintiff from taking any action in the Civil Court action. Since the court conditioned the release of the defendants’ $60,000 payment from escrow upon the plaintiffs delivery of general releases, so much of the order as directed the defendants to place $60,000 in escrow must be vacated.\\nRivera, J.E, Lott, Roman and Hinds-Radix, JJ., concur.',\n",

       "       'text': 'Order, Supreme Court, New York County (Marylin G. Diamond, J.), entered December 26, 2007, which denied plaintiffs motion to stay and remove a Civil Court proceeding for consolidation with the instant action, and stayed this action pending resolution of the Civil Court proceeding, unanimously affirmed, with costs.\\nDefendant agreed in Civil Court to the entry of a judgment of eviction and to vacate the premises in exchange for $550,000, in accordance with NY City Civil Court Act § 204. The Housing Part of Civil Court has the same subject matter jurisdiction to compel compliance with this “so-ordered” settlement agreement (see CPLR 5221 [a] [3]; NY City Civ Ct Act § 1508) as would the Supreme Court (see NY City Civ Ct Act § 212). Once such jurisdiction is established, Civil Court is able to hear related matters, such as plaintiffs cross motion to disgorge disputed funds, and the determination of monies due defendant, pursuant to its adjunct power under section 212.\\nPlaintiffs argument that it was unable to provide defendant with copies of the settlement between the remaining rent stabilized tenant and the prospective purchaser is unavailing. The plain language of the settlement makes it clear that plaintiff would provide not only any agreement it entered into with the remaining rent stabilized tenant, but “any other agreements or writing or documents related to any compensation received by [the tenant] for her surrendering and vacating her apartment at the Premises.”\\nWe reject plaintiffs argument that the Civil Court proceeding must be removed to Supreme Court because it seeks substantial disclosure. A summary proceeding pursuant to the Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law is a special proceeding (CPLR art 4) in which disclosure may be utilized by leave of court (CPLR 408; McQueen v Grinker, 158 AD2d 355, 359 [1990]). Stay of an action rests within the court’s discretion (see Britt v International Bus Servs., 255 AD2d 143, 144 [1998]).\\nIn general, only where the decision in one action will determine all the questions in the other action, and the judg ment on one trial will dispose of the controversy in both, is a stay justified; this requires a complete identity of the parties, the causes of action and the judgment sought (Pierre Assoc. v Citizens Cas. Co. of N.Y., 32 AD2d 495, 497 [1969]). Here, the Civil Court proceeding involved an enforcement action in which plaintiff willingly submitted its contention of a breach on the part of defendant. The central issue in both the Civil Court proceeding and the Supreme Court action is whether defendant breached the confidentiality provision of her settlement agreement, thereby requiring defendant to disgorge all funds previously received from plaintiff. Accordingly, the IAS court’s sua sponte grant of a stay pending resolution of the Civil Court proceeding was not improper. Concur—Andrias, J.P, Gonzalez, Moskowitz and DeGrasse, JJ.',\n",

       "       'text': 'Arthur A. Klotz, J.\\nThis is a motion for leave to amend the summons and complaint to the extent of increasing the demand for damages on behalf of the plaintiff Samuel Miller from $2,000 to $10,000.\\nThe action was initially instituted in the Municipal Court of the City of New York on September 17,1960, requesting damages on behalf of this plaintiff, in the sum of $2,000.\\nThe affidavit of the treating physician, attached to the moving papers, indicates that the plaintiff Miller sustained a whiplash injury to the neck; fracture of the posterior surface of both C-6 and C-7; arthritic lipping of C-6 and C-7; thinning of the inter-vertebral disc between C-6 and C-7; numbness and tingling in the fifth fingers of both hands; and limitation of motion of the cervical region. The supporting affidavit of plaintiff’s attorney on this application sets forth that plaintiff did not learn of the seriousness of the injuries until November 8, 1960. No reason for the delay in making the present motion is presented.\\nThe court would be inclined to deny the application because of this long delay, except that the injuries plaintiff complains of, substantiated by a medical affidavit, appear of sufficient gravity to warrant relief. While prejudice because of the delay in making this motion is claimed by the defendant, none is in fact shown. The defendant had a physical examination of the plaintiff on November 29, 1960, and another one will be directed as a condition for the granting of the present motion.\\nIt appears appropriate to set forth that motions of this nature have been denied by some of my colleagues based on section 192 (subd. [c], par. [2]) of the New York City Civil Court Act. That section in pertinent part provides:\\n“ § 192. Cases in abolished courts carried over. All actions and proceedings pending in the city court of the city of New York or the municipal court of the city of New York at the time this act takes effect shall be deemed pending in this court and shall be governed by the following subdivisions of this section. * * *\\n“ (c) For the purpose of the disposition of such actions and proceedings only, the jurisdiction of this court shall be deemed:\\n“ (2) contracted to that of the abolished court so as to prevent this court from giving relief of such nature or in such amount as could not be given by the abolished court.”\\nThis section has been interpreted to preclude a motion to raise the amount of damage claimed beyond the jurisdiction of the former court from which the action emanated. A literal reading of section 192, of course, sustains this interpretation.\\nThe Civil Court of the City of New York came into being September 1, 1962, and has jurisdiction in tort actions up to $10,000, in all cases instituted in the new Civil Court. In the exercise of this jurisdiction, the court has the powers that the Supreme Court would have in like actions and proceedings (N. Y. City Civ. Ct. Act, § 16).\\nThe Civil Court also has a dual jurisdiction in that the jurisdiction of the court is contracted on matters transferred to it from the Municipal Court of the City of New York or the City ,Court of the City of New York to that of the respective abolished courts. This, to me, means that in the normal processing of cases transferred to the Civil Court of the City of New York from either the former Municipal Court of the City of New York or the former City Court of the City of New York, the Civil .Court is limited in granting relief by the same jurisdictional limitations as the respective abolished courts. But litigants in such contracted causes still have the rights given by section 110-a of the Civil Practice Act which provides that where the damages sustained by a plaintiff are greater in amount than .originally alleged, and the court in which such action is pending does not have jurisdiction thereof, or is not empowered to award a judgment for such increased amount, the action may be removed to a court having the proper jurisdiction.\\nIt seems to me that where a litigant who heretofore had a case .pending in either the Municipal Court of the City of New York, with its jurisdictional limit of $3,000, or the City Court of the City of New York, with its jurisdictional limit of $6,000, desires to increase the request for damages to the sum of $10,000, such an application can be made to a Judge of the Civil Court of the City of New York and that, in these circumstances, the Civil Court has a dual position. It is, of course, as heretofore indicated, a court of contracted jurisdiction with regard to cases transferred to it from the former Municipal Court of the City of New York and the City Court of the City of New York. It is also an expanded civil court under the constitution of the State of New York with jurisdiction in tort cases up to $10,000. It may hear a motion made pursuant to section 110-a of the Civil Practice Act in a contracted cause and, upon a proper showing, transpose this pending old litigation from the contracted jurisdiction of the Civil Court to the expanded jurisdiction of the Civil Court, and section 192 of the New York City Civil Court Act should not be read to prevent a motion of this kind from being made in this court. Such an interpretation gives meaning to section 192 (subd. [c], par. [2]) of the New York City Civil Court Act and to section 110-a of the Civil Practice Act as well. It prevents unnecessary circuitous action. To hold otherwise would require a litigant to move for relief under section 110-a of the Civil Practice Act in the Supreme Court, which court would, if it favorably entertained the motion, be required to transfer the cause to that court and, in turn, retransfer it to the Civil Court of the City of New York, since the cause would then be within the jurisdictional limitation of the Civil Court.\\nIt is for these reasons that I conclude that the Civil Court of the City of New York has the power to grant relief on a motion to increase the amount of damages originally requested.\\nPlaintiff will be required to submit to another physical examination if defendant feels so advised. The time of such examination shall be indicated on the settlement of the order to be entered hereon. The motion is granted accordingly.',\n",

Upon an appeal to the circuit court from a judgment of the civil court of Milwaukee county in an action for forcible entry and detainer, the procedure is governed by sec. 28, ch. 549, Laws of 1909, and not by sec. 3370, Stats.

The defendants answered setting forth that the premises in dispute were held by them under a written lease from the plaintiff expiring April 30,- 1910, and that before said lease expired the parties entered into an agreement whereby the term of the lease was extended until July 1,1910. The issues were submitted to a jury and a verdict returned in favor of the plaintiff, upon which judgment was subsequently entered. Thereupon the defendants appealed the action to the circuit court for Milwaukee county. Upon due notice plaintiff made a motion in that court for an order confirming the judgment of the civil court. The motion was granted and an order made reciting that the court was satisfied that no manifest prejudicial error was committed in the trial of said action in the civil court, and that both parties thereto had a fair trial in said court, and directing that judgment should be entered confirming tbe judgment of tbe civil court.

       "       'text': \"ViNJE, J.\\nTbe most important assignment of error is that tbe civil court bad no jurisdiction of an action of forcible entry and detainer. If this assignment is well founded it disposes of tbe whole case, for, if tbe lower court has no jurisdiction over tbe subject matter of tbe action, an appeal confers no jurisdiction upon the appellate court, and in such case its duty is to dismiss tbe action. Felt v. Felt, 19 Wis. 193; Klaise v. State, 27 Wis. 462; Stoltman v. Lake, 124 Wis. 462, 102 N. W. 920; Miltimore v. Hoffman, 125 Wis. 558, 104 N. W. 841.\\nTbe civil court of Milwaukee county was established by cb. 549 of the Laws of 1909. Sec. 5 of that act, defining its jurisdiction, provides:\\n“Tbe said civil court shall have jurisdiction and cognizance-of tbe actions and proceedings set forth and enumerated in section 3572 of the statutes, when the amount claimed or involved in such actions or proceedings does not exceed tbe sum-of one thousand dollars; and shall possess, except so far as may be inconsistent with tbe provisions of this act, tbe jurisdiction and powers over persons and subject matter heretofore possessed by justices of the peace in tbe city of Milwaukee immediately prior to tbe passage of this act, provided said court shall have jurisdiction of any action founded on an account when tbe same shall not exceed in amount, or shall have been reduced by payments to an amount not exceeding one thousand dollars; and shall have territorial jurisdiction co-extensive with tbe county of Milwaukee.” ■ .\\nIt is also given jurisdiction of actions for libel, slander, malicious prosecution, or false imprisonment, and of actions-for or against any town within tbe county, where in each of tbe above classes of actions tbe amount claimed or involved does not exceed $1,000.\\nUpon reference to sec. 3572, Stats. (1898), it will be observed that it consists of twelve subdivisions, each of which, except subd. 9, contains a limitation as to amount. Subd. 9 reads: “Actions for forcible entry and detainer.” Defend■ant contends that tbe clause in sec. 5 of tbe civil court act, “when tbe amount claimed or involved in sucb actions or proceedings does not exceed tbe sum of one thousand dollars,” should be held to limit every subdivision of sec. 3572, Stats. (1898), so that subd. 9 would read as follows: “Actions for forcible entry and detainer — when tbe amount claimed or involved does not exceed tbe sum of one tb’ousand dollars;” and that, inasmuch as no amount involved or claimed appeared upon tbe record in this action, tbe civil court was without jurisdiction. We are unable to give that construction to the provisions of sec. 5 of tbe act. In our opinion tbe clear legislative intent was to give tbe civil court jurisdiction of every action or proceeding mentioned in each subdivision, except subd. 9, when tbe amount claimed or involved does not exceed $1,000, and to give it jurisdiction of actions for forcible entry and detainer regardless of tbe amount .involved or claimed. In other words, the clause as to limitation of amount does not limit subd. 9 of sec. 3572. This construction seems so clear and obvious as not to require argument or analysis to support it. It is sufficient to say that in 'actions for forcible entry and detainer there is no definite amount of money involved and hence none can be claimed. It would be absurd to provide a money limit where no money is sought to be recovered. Tbe damages sustained by reason of an unlawful detainer must be recovered in a separate action. Sec. 3367, Stats.! (1898). _ _ |\\n_ _ It is also urged that tbe circuit court bad no power to enter' judgment upon tbe appeal without a trial de novo as provided by sec. 3370, Stats. (1898). This raises tbe question of wbetber tbe provisions of tbe section of tbe statute mentioned, as to sneb cases appealed from tbe civil court, govern tbe procedure thereof in tbe appellate court, or wbetber it is-governed by tbe provisions of tbe civil court act. Sec. 28 of that act relates to appeals to tbe circuit court and provides as follows:\\n“1. Except as herein provided, an appeal may be taken to-tbe circuit court of Milwaukee county by any party to an action or proceeding in said civil court from any final judgment-of said civil court or from any order of said civil court from which an appeal to tbe supreme court might be taken if such order were made by a circuit court. . . .\\n“2. Upon such appeals tbe circuit court shall either affirm or reverse any judgment so appealed from, except that said circuit court may modify, and affirm as modified, any such judgment in all cases where tbe same might have been so modified, and affirmed as modified, if such appeál bad been taken to tbe supreme court from tbe judgment of tbe circuit court.\\n“3. Every judgment of said civil court shall be affirmed or modified and affirmed as so modified, by tbe -circuit court, upon appeal, unless, by reason of manifest prejudicial error in the trial of tbe action in which such judgment was rendered, any party thereto has not bad a fair trial thereof in tbe civil court; but in any such case of mistrial, where substantial justice cannot otherwise Be done and tbe rights of tbe parties-otherwise observed and protected, tbe judgment of tbe civil court therein shall be reversed, and tbe circuit court shall order tbe action tried in said circuit court in tbe same manner as if originally brought there. . . .\\n“4. At any time after tbe filing in tbe circuit court of tbe return upon any appeal from said civil court, any party to tbe action or proceeding in which such appeal is taken, upon notice given as required of other motions in tbe circuit court, may move that the judgment appealed from be affirmed, or reversed, or modified and affirmed as modified, or that tbe order appealed from be affirmed or reversed. . .\\nIt will be perceived that under this scheme a new trial is bad in tbe circuit court only when that court is satisfied that. by reason of manifest prejudicial error in the trial in tbe civil court the parties did not have a fair trial, and that substantial .justice cannot otherwise be done and the rights of the parties otherwise observed and protected. The wisdom of this scheme becomes apparent upon a moment’s reflection. The purpose of establishing the civil court was to provide a reasonably adequate and competent tribunal in which cases of minor importance could receive a fair, and in most of them a final, trial, and so relieve the circuit court of the burden of trying such cases de novo upon appeal. It is a matter of common knowledge that trials in justices’ courts are usually mere matters of form, even when defendants appear therein, and it is •equally well known that in many cases the defendant does not ■even appear to defend, but prefers to see what case plaintiff makes by his evidence, and then takes an appeal to the circuit ■court. It was no doubt to stop this abuse, as well as to relieve the circuit court of the trial of the majority of cases of which the civil court has jurisdiction, that the act provided that only in cases where manifest prejudicial error had intervened, and substantial justice to the parties could not otherwise be done> a new trial should be had.\\nThe court created is far higher in character and dignity than is a justice’s court. It has jurisdiction to the amount of $1,000, and can try actions for libel, slander, malicious prosecution, or false imprisonment, and actions for or against any town in the county where the amount claimed or involved does not exceed the jurisdictional limit of $1,000. The judge, in order to be qualified to hold the office, must have been a practicing attorney in the state for three years prior to his election. He is paid a salary of $3,000 per year, and is forbidden to practice law in any of the courts of the county while holding his office. Secs. 7, 13. The court has a clerk and seven deputy clerks. Sec. 11. It will thus.be seen that a tribunal has been created well qualified to try cases intrusted to its jurisdiction, and that appeals coming from the civil court to the circuit court may properly stand upon a different footing than appeals coming from a justice’s court. A careful reading of the language of sec. 28 of the act fails to disclose any exception thereto in cases of forcible entry and detainer, and we are of the opinion that none was intended. Such actions upon appeal are governed by the provisions of the civil court act and not by see. 3370, Stats. (1898), relating to appeals from justices’ courts. The circuit court therefore properly entertained the motion to affirm the judgment.\\nIt is also urged by the defendant that the verdict of the jury in the civil court was contrary to the evidence and hence the judgment should have been reversed. The circuit court, by affirming the judgment, sustained the verdict. We find nothing in the record to warrant us in disturbing this ruling. On the contrary, we think the preponderance of the evidence supports the verdict.\\nBy the Court. — Judgment affirmed.\",\n",

       "       'text': \"Mathews, Commissioner).\\nThe case was a civil action for damages for personal injuries, commenced in the Civil Court of Record for Hillsborough County, by the petitioners as plaintiffs, against the respondent, as defendant. The defendant appeared and filed his plea of “not guilty.” Thereafter the cause was placed upon the trial docket. There had existed in said Civil Court a long established and continuous practice and custom of notifying all attorneys practicing before that Court, not only of the sounding of the docket, but it was also the custom of that court to cause a printed list of all cases set by the Court at the sounding of the docket to be mailed to all attorneys of record in the cases set, stating the dates on which the cases were to be tried. Shortly before February 25th, 1931, the presiding Judge of the Civil Court resigned. On February 25th, 1931, the newly appointed Judge of the Civil Court decided to hold a trial session of that- court, beginning March 9th, 1931. Thereupon the then Judge of the said Civil Court, disregarding the previous continuous custom of the court, oh which the attorneys practicing therein had relied, directed the Clerk to call by telephone the office of all the attorneys of record in cases which were ready for trial in said court, and to notify the attorneys that the court would, on February 28th, 1931, set causes for trial. Neither the defendant nor his attorneys received any notice whatsoever of the sounding of the docket, nor did the Clerk of the Court notify the attorneys for defend ant in any manner of the date on which this case had been set for trial, either by telephone or by mailing a printed list of the cases, though a typewritten list of the eases set for trial was posted on the wall in the Clerk’s office. •\\nAt the sounding of the docket on February 28th, 1931, this ease was set for trial on March 12th, 1931, and on that date neither the defendant nor his attorney appearing, the court ordered the cause to proceed ex parte, and verdict and judgment resulted in favor of the plaintiffs for the full amount claimed in plaintiff’s declaration. Thereafter, on March 30th, 1931, during the term at which the judgment was rendered and entered, and immediately upon the discovery of the same, the defendant filed his motion to vacate and set aside the verdict and final judgment in said cause, properly supported by affidavits.\\nThereafter, on April 11th, 1931, upon hearing had, the Judge of the Civil Court of Record made an order refusing to vacate the final judgment therein rendered, upon the ground that he was without jurisdiction to hear and determine the motion.\\nThereafter the defendant, taking a bill of exceptions, sued out writ of error to the Circuit Court of Hills-borough County, Florida, which Court on December 29th, 1931, handed down its opinion wherein the order entered by the Judge of the Civil Court of Record was reversed, and the said judge was directed to hear and determine the defendant’s motion to vacate the judgment on its merits. The Civil Court of Record of Hillsborough County went out of existence on December 31,1931, without having passed upon defendant’s motion; and thereafter on April 19th, 1932, the Circuit Court, upon a consideration of defendant’s motion to vacate the judgment granted the same and entered an order vacating and setting aside the verdict and judgment of the Civil Court of Record.\\nPlaintiffs, on May 2nd, 1932, filéd their petition herein for the issuance of a writ of certiorari, alleging that there was no remedy by writ of error as the order complained of was not a final judgment. The writ was issued on said date to W. A. Dickerson, Clerk of the Circuit Court in and for Hillsborough County, directing said Clerk to transmit to this Court the record of a certain cause determined in the Circuit Court, wherein petitioners herein were plaintiffs and respondent herein was defendant. Upon return to the writ, the respondent moved to quash the writ upon several grounds, the substance of which may be stated to be that the Circuit Court was not without jurisdiction to make the order complained of and that the record discloses no procedure in the Circuit Court which was not in accordance with the essential requirements of the law.\\nThe writ of certiorari lies to determine whether the inferior tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction, or has not proceeded according to the essential requirements of the law in cases where no direct appellate proceedings are provided by law. Brundage vs. O’Berry, 101 Fla. 320, 134 So. 520.\\nWhere review of judgment of civil court of record by writ of error from circuit court is cut off by abolishment of former court, certiorari is' the proper remedy to review errors apparent of record. Salario v. Latin-American Bank, 104 Fla. 256, 139 So. 899; Acts of 1931, Ch. 14663.\\nIn this ease the Circuit Court had handed down its decision on the appeal on December 29th, 1931, before the Civil Court of Record had become extinct. By that decision, the circuit court reversed the civil court and directed it to determine respondent’s motion to vacate the judgment on its1 merits. Before its mandate was complied with, the civil court went out of existence and its jurisdiction automatically became vested in the circuit court and it thereupon became incumbent upon the circuit court to proceed with the unexercised powlers formerly committed to the civil court of record. State ex rel. Landis vs. Dickenson, 103 Fla. 907, 138 So. 376.\\nAlso the circuit court as the successor to the jurisdiction of the civil court of record could legally proceed to comply with the mandate theretofore filed in the civil court of record, and was fully at liberty to proceed to determine the merits of respondent’s motion to vacate the judgment, for this was a further judicial proceeding required to be taken at the time the civil court of record was abolished. State ex rel. Landis vs. Dickenson, supra.\\nRespondent’s motion to vacate the judgment against him was filed during the term at which the judgment was rendered. Alabama Hotel Co. vs. Mott Iron Works, 86 Fla. 608, 98 So. 825; Robinson vs. Farmers & Merchants Bank, 95 Fla. 940, 117 So. 393; Whitaker vs. Wright, 100 Fla. 282, 129 So. 889.\\nThe motion to vacate the verdict and judgment was based upon surprise resulting from a violation of an es^ tablished custom upon which defendant had a right to rely. Flournoy vs. Monson, 51 Fla. 198, 41 So. 398. It was addressed to the sound legal discretion of the court which heard and considered the motion on the evidence presented, and that discretion does not appear to have been abused. Alabama Hotel Co. vs. Mott Iron Works, supra.\\nIt does not appear that the circuit court exceeded its jurisdiction, and it does not appear to have failed to proceed according to the essential requirements of the law.\\nIt is ordered that the writ of certiorari he, and the same is hereby quashed.\\nPer Curiam.\\nThe record in this cause having been considered by the court, and the foregoing opinion prepared under chapter 14553, Acts of 1929 (Extra Session), adopted by the court as its opinion, it is considered, ordered and decreed by the court that the writ of certiorari be, and the same is hereby quashed.\\nBuford, C.J., and 'Whitfield, Terrell, Brown and Davis, J.J., concur.\",\n",

       "       'text': 'In a proceeding to enforce compliance by Skyline NYC, LLC, with the New York City Housing Maintenance Code (Administrative Code of City of NY, tit 27, ch 2), the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development appeals, by permission, from an order of the Appellate Term for the 2nd, 11th, and 13th Judicial Districts dated September 29, 2008, which reversed an order of the Civil Court, Bangs County (Gonzalez, J.), dated February 1, 2007, denying the motion of Skyline NYC, LLC, to vacate a judgment entered upon its default in answering or appearing and to dismiss the petition, and thereupon granted the motion, vacated the judgment entered upon default, and dismissed the proceeding.\\nOrdered that the order dated September 29, 2008, is affirmed, with costs.\\nThe petitioner commenced this proceeding to enforce compliance by Skyline NYC, LLC (hereinafter the owner), with the New York City Housing Maintenance Code (Administrative Code of City of New York, tit 27, ch 2; hereinafter the Housing Maintenance Code) by compelling it to correct certain outstanding violations of the Housing Maintenance Code extant at its property. In the order to show cause submitted and filed with the verified petition to commence the proceeding {see NY City Civ Ct Act § 400 [1]), the Civil Court directed that service of those papers was to be effected upon the owner by regular first-class mail, with certificate of mailing. When the owner defaulted in answering the petition or appearing in the proceeding, an order to correct certain violations and a subsequent judgment imposing civil penalties were entered against it. The owner subsequently moved to vacate both the order to correct the violations and the judgment entered upon its default in answering or appearing, and to dismiss the petition, upon the grounds, inter alia, that service by regular first-class mail was unauthorized and improper. The Civil Court denied the motion, concluding that it had the authority to direct service by regular first-class mail, and that the petitioner had complied with the terms of the order to show cause. The Appellate Term reversed the order of the Civil Court denying the motion, vacated the judgment, and dismissed the proceeding, concluding that the Civil Court did not have authority to direct service of the order to show cause and petition by regular first-class mail without the petitioner’s showing of special circumstances, and that, in effect, the Civil Court lacked personal jurisdiction over the owner. The New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development appeals, contending that the Civil Court had the authority under the New York City Civil Court Act and the Housing Maintenance Code to direct service by regular first-class mail, without a showing of special circumstances. We agree with the Appellate Term.\\nThe New York City Civil Court Act (hereinafter the Act) provides, as relevant here, that service, within the City of New York, of a summons, a notice of petition, or an order to show cause commencing a special proceeding may be made in the same manner as authorized in Supreme Court practice under the CPLR (see NY City Civ Ct Act § 403; see also NY City Civ Ct Act § 400 [2]; CPLR 403 [c], [d]). The Act also provides, however, that service of process in certain actions and proceedings commenced in the Housing Part of the Civil Court involving the enforcement of laws regarding maintenance of housing standards may also be served, “as an alternative,” as provided for “in the housing maintenance code of the administrative code of the city of New York” (NY City Civ Ct Act § 110 [a], [m] [1]). Insofar as relevant here, section 27-2115 of the Housing Maintenance Code provides that, in proceedings such as the one at bar:\\n“(h) (1) . . . the tenant . . . may . . . apply to the housing part for an order directing the owner and the department to appear before the court. Such order shall be issued at the discretion of the court for good cause shown, and shall be served as the court may direct . . .\\n“(j) If a tenant seeks an order directing the owner and the department to appear before the court pursuant to subdivision (h) . . . of this section, the court may allow service of the order by the tenant by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.”\\nThese two subsections must be read together. If, as the Civil Court held, that court may, under subdivision (h), order that service be effected in any manner that it directs, subdivision (j) would be superfluous since the court would already have possessed, even in the absence of subdivision (j), the authority expressly granted to it by subdivision (j) to direct that service be effected by a tenant through the use of registered or certified mail. Indeed, the enactment of subdivision (j), which postdated the enactment of subdivision (h), would have accomplished nothing. Contrary to the conclusion of the Civil Court, however, courts must give effect to the wording of a statute without rejecting any words as superfluous, and must harmonize related provisions in a way that renders them compatible (see Matter of Tall Trees Constr. Corp. v Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Town of Huntington, 97 NY2d 86, 91 [2001]). Subdivision (j), therefore, must be read as effectively providing the Civil Court with the option of permitting service of a notice of petition or order to show cause in a manner not otherwise authorized by subdivision (h) or by other applicable statutes, but which would nevertheless ensure that an owner actually receives process, namely, by authorizing service by the tenant by certified or registered mail (see Mem of City of NY, Bill Jacket, L 1980, ch 526, 1980 NY Legis Ann, at 209-210; cf. CPLR 2103 [a]).\\nAccordingly, the Appellate Term properly concluded that the Civil Court was not authorized, under the circumstances of this case, to permit service of the order to show cause and petition by regular first-class mail, with certificate of mailing. Consequently, the Appellate Term properly reversed the order of the Civil Court, granted the owner’s motion to vacate the judgment and dismiss the petition, and dismissed the proceeding.

       "       'text': 'The following opinion was filed May 14, 1912:\\nKeRWOT, J.\\nOh. 549, Laws of 1909, as amended by ch. 425, Laws of 1911, regulates the procedure in the civil courts of Milwaukee county. The record in this case shows that the plaintiff, in attempting to appeal from the judgment of the civil court to the circuit court, served a notice of appeal and affidavit that the appeal was made in good faith and not for the purpose of delay upon the clerk of the civil court, but served neither upon the judge of said court. The question, therefore, arises whether any appeal was ever taken from the judgment of the civil court. We find no provision of law authorizing such appeal without service upon the judge of the civil court. On the contrary, it seems that service upon the judge of the civil court is necessary under the statute. Subd. 1 of sec. 14, ch. 549, Laws of 1909, as amended, provides that all “proceedings in said civil court and in appeals therefrom shall, except as herein otherwise provided, be governed by the provisions of title XXVIII of the statutes, as amended, relating to courts of justice of the peace and proceedings therein in civil cases. . . . The following sections of the statutes are hereby declared to be inapplicable to said court or the proceedings therein: Secs. 3569, 3584 to 3592, inclusive; 3598, 3616, 3611, 3623, 3638, 3666, 3661, 3116, and 3776.” Subd. 2 of the same section and chapter as amended provides that in actions and proceedings specified in sees. 3572 and 3573, Stats., commenced in said court, where the amount involved shall exceed the sum of $200, except actions of forcible entry and detainer, “the practice, pleadings, trials, judgments and proceedings thereafter shall be governed by the provisions of law relating to circuit couifis and proceedings therein; except that the time in which any proceeding shall be had shall be governed by the provisions of this act and of said title XXVIII so far as applicable. . . .” The “proceedings thereafter” refer to proceedings on the judgment in the civil court and do not include appeals from the judgment. Proceedings after judgment, under this provision of the statute, have reference to proceedings for the enforcement of the judgment or in conformity with the judgment, not in hostility to it, while proceedings upon appeal have reference to proceedings adverse to the judgment. This becomes apparent when read in connection with subd. 1 of sec. 28, ch. 549, Laws of 1909, as amended, which provides:\\n“. . . Except in bastardy cases, and except as herein otherwise provided, an appeal may be taken to the circuit court of Milwaukee county by any party to an action or proceeding in said civil court from any final judgment of said civil court, or from any order of said civil court from which an appeal to the supreme court might be taken if such order were made by a circuit court. ■ Such appeals shall be taken within twenty days after the entry of the judgment or order appealed from, and the returns and amended returns upon such appeals shall be made by the clerk of said civil court in tlie manner provided in ch. 160 of the statutes, relating to appeals from justices’ courts. . .\\nAlso the following portion of subd. 5 of sec. 28 of said ch. 549:\\n“The proceedings upon any appeal from any judgment or order of the civil court, except as herein otherwise provided, shall be governed by the provisions of ch. 160 of the statutes relating to appeals from justices’ courts and judgments of justices of the peace so far as such provisions may be applicable thereto.”\\nAs to the questions reviewable on appeal see Eder v. Grifka, 149 Wis. 607, 136 N. W. 154.\\nWe think the provisions of the statutes referred to leave appeals from the civil to the circuit court governed by the statutes relating to appeals from courts of justices of the peace, except that in appeals from judgments of the civil court the returns and amended returns upon appeal shall be made by the clerk; but that the notice of appeal and affidavit must be served upon the civil judge. This was not done in the case at bar, therefore no appeal was taken, and the circuit court was without jurisdiction to make the order ^appealed from.\\nNo other questions need be considered.\\nBy the Court. — The order appealed from is reversed.\\nTimlin, J., took no part.',\n",

       "       'text': \"The following opinion was filed June 2, 1936 :\\nFowler, J.\\nBoth parties to the actions attack the orders of the circuit court reversing the judgments and remanding the cases to the civil court for retrial, the appellants on the ground that the circuit court should have ruled that on the undisputed evidence Petersen was not negligent as matter of law, and should have reversed the civil court’s judgments and dismissed the complaints on the merits, and the respondents on the ground that the civil court’s findings of negligence are supported by the evidence and the circuit court should have affirmed the judgments. The appellants also claim that if the civil court’s findings of negligence are supported by the evidence, the damages assessed by the civil court are so grossly excessive that the circuit court’s order for a new trial should be affirmed or other appropriate relief should be granted to them.\\nIn entering the order appealed from, the circuit court acted under sec. 2, ch. 399, Laws of 1935, which reads as follows:\\n“Upon an appeal from a judgment of the civil court to the circuit court, the circuit court may reverse, affirm or modify the judgment, and in case of a reversal or modification the circuit court may enter such judgment as may he proper. Where, however, by reason of manifest prejudicial error in the trial of the action in the civil court any party thereto has not had a fair trial and where substantial justice cannot otherwise be done and the rights of the parties otherwise observed and protected, the judgment of the civil court shall be reversed, and the circuit court shall remit the case to the civil court for a new trial or further proceedings.”\\nThe circuit judge was of the view that “manifest prejudicial error” occurred on the trial of the cases in the civil court “necessitating a new trial in that court.” The basis of this view, as disclosed by the written opinion of the circuit judge, is that there was “no' finding that Petersen invaded the left side of the road just before the collision (nor any basis in the evidence for such finding),” and therefore no basis for the trial court’s findings of negligence, and as neither the driver of the truck nor a person on the driver’s seat with him were produced as witnesses on the trial, there should be a new trial to procure their testimony to establish the “actual position and movements of the truck,” and thus afford a basis for a finding as to Petersen’s negligence. We are of opinion that the circuit judge was wrong in his view that Petersen could not be found guilty of negligence as to lookout or control of his car in absence of evidence that he did not invade the left side of the road. After passing the headlights of the truck, when his view was not interfered with, and when he was in a safe position on the highway, he turned left to get back “into his line of travel,” and went so far to his left that he collided with the truck. This in our opinion fully warranted the inference of the civil court that Petersen was negligent as to lookout and control of his car, even if the truck was invading his side of the road. The finding of the civil court was not error to say nothing of its not being “manifestly prejudicial error.” Nor was it “manifestly prejudicial error” or any error at all for the civil court to base its findings on the evidence that the parties saw fit to present, and not order a new trial on its own motion for production of the testimony of witnesses that the parties, for reasons satisfactory to themselves, did not care to' present.\\nThe above seems to us sufficient to show that the circuit court should have affirmed the judgments of the civil court, unless the assessments of damages by that court were so high as to compel interference with the judgments entered. We do not consider that the citation of adjudicated cases is necessary or would be helpful. We are not unmindful of the rulings in Eisenhut v. Eisenhut, 212 Wis. 467, 248 N. W. 440, 250 N. W. 441, and Cleary v. Eckart, 191 Wis. 114, 210 N. W. 267, as to the duties of host to guest in automobile cases, but it seems obvious to us that the facts of the instant case do not bring it within the reason or the rule of either of them. The case of Poneitowcki v. Harres, 200 Wis. 504, 228 N. W. 126, is more to the point. As to the damages assessed by the civil court, we cannot regard them as beyond the limits which the injuries involved might reasonably warrant.\\nBy the Court. — The order of the circuit court in each case is reversed, and the cause remanded with directions to enter judgment affirming the judgment of the civil court.\\nA motion for a rehearing was denied, with $25 costs, on September 15, 1936.\",\n",

Defendant surrendered possession shortly thereafter, and an order was entered in April 1996 (Dankberg, J.) converting the proceeding to a plenary action. Plaintiff then served a complaint under a new index number which, in its present incarnation, sets forth causes of action for rent in the sum of $77,887.24 for the period April through July 1995 and in the sum of $311,154.17 for the period August 1995 through October 1996. Defendant’s motion to dismiss for lack of statutory jurisdiction to hear the action or, in the alternative, to transfer the action to Supreme Court for plenary consideration, was denied by Civil Court.\\nIt is of course true that a judgment for rent may be rendered in a summary proceeding “without regard to amount” (CCA 204), and jurisdiction is not divested merely because of the removal of the respondent subsequent to the commencement of the proceeding (Four Forty-One Holding Corp. v Bloom, 148 Misc 565). However, in this case, with the service of new pleadings for the recovery of money damages only (substantially in excess of what was originally sought in the nonpayment petition), it cannot be realistically argued that the matter retained its character as a summary proceeding. All that is before the court, in form as well as substance, is an action at law for past due rent which cannot be pursued in the plenary part of Civil Court to the extent the amount sought exceeds that court’s jurisdictional limit of $25,000 (CCA 202; S.S.I.G. Realty v Bologna Holding Corp., 213 AD2d 617, 619). Under such circumstances, the proper course was to transfer the action to Supreme Court pursuant to article VI, section 19 (f) of the NY State Constitution (Hillman v CNA Ins. Cos., 132 Misc 2d 421).\\n*\\nPlaintiff also sought to interpose an additional cause of action for future rent ($1,189,407.30) which would have accrued through the lease termination date in November 2001, but this relief was denied below.',\n",

This litigation was originally com menced as a summary nonpayment proceeding and calendared in the commercial landlord-tenant part of the Civil Court. After the tenant surrendered possession of the premises, the proceeding was deemed a plenary action and transferred to the general Civil Court calendar for resolution of the monetary claims for outstanding rent (see, CPLR 103 [c]; Cabell, Kennedy & French v Walshe, NYLJ, Apr. 29, 1986, at 6, col 2 [App Term, 1st Dept]). The majority takes no issue with this procedure, but holds that the matter cannot be pursued in the plenary part of the Civil Court to the extent that the amount sought exceeds that court’s jurisdictional limit of $25,000. In my view, however, subject matter jurisdiction vested when this matter was commenced as a summary proceeding and, therefore, the Civil Court retained jurisdiction to render judgment for rent due without regard to amount.\\nIn a summary proceeding, the Civil Court has subject matter jurisdiction “to render judgment for rent due without regard to amount” (CCA 204). The Civil Court’s jurisdiction to adjudicate an unlimited rent claim vested when this matter was commenced as a summary proceeding. Once subject matter jurisdiction vested, it “was not divested by subsequent events, although of such character as would have prevented jurisdiction from attaching in the first instance” (Four Forty-One Holding Corp. v Bloom, 148 Misc 565, 567 [App Term, 1st Dept]). Therefore, the subsequent deeming of this matter to be a plenary action, after tenant surrendered possession, and the transfer of the matter from one Civil Court calendar to another, did not divest the Civil Court of jurisdiction to render judgment for rent due without regard to amount (see, Paumi Corp. v Khafi, NYLJ, Jan. 31, 1990, at 24, col 3).\\nLandlord’s service of a new pleading does not warrant a contrary result. Landlord has simply sought to amend the original claim for rent to assert a claim for rent that postdates the petition. Due consideration should be given to not placing form over substance where, as here, the Civil Court ab initio properly obtained jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter. It is the Civil Court that is the preferred forum to conduct landlord-tenant litigation (Cox v J.D. Realty Assocs., 217 AD2d 179). Having been properly commenced as a summary proceeding in the Civil Court, this matter should be litigated to conclusion in that court. Civil Court’s denial of the motion to transfer this matter to Supreme Court should therefore be affirmed.\\nParness, P.

       "       'text': 'In an action to recover damages for personal injuries, etc., the plaintiff appeals, by permission, from an order of the Appellate Term of the Supreme Court, Second and Eleventh Judicial Districts, dated November 7, 2005 [10 Mise 3d 33], which affirmed an order of the Civil Court of the City of New York, Kings County (Rubin, J.), dated April 1, 2004, granting the motion of the defendant From Head to Toe of Brooklyn, Inc., Beauty Center, sued herein as From Head to Toe of Brooklyn, Inc., and the separate motion of the defendants 407 Seventh Avenue Owners Corp., sued herein as 407 Seventh Avenue Corp., Roman Katsnelson, and Yury Leschinsky, inter alia, to dismiss the action as abandoned pursuant to CPLR 3404.\\nOrdered that the order dated November 7, 2005 is reversed, on the law, with one bill of costs payable by the respondents appearing separately and filing separate briefs, the order of the Civil Court of the City of New York, Kings County, dated April 1, 2004, is reversed, and the defendants’ motions, inter alia, to dismiss the action as abandoned pursuant to CPLR 3404 are denied.\\nThe plaintiff commenced this personal injury action in the Civil Court of the City of New York, Kangs County, in 1996. The action appeared on the “ready” trial calendar on May 31, 2001. The plaintiff failed to appear on that date, and the action was “marked off’ the calendar. The plaintiff never moved to restore the action to the trial calendar, and in 2004 the defendants made separate motions to dismiss the action pursuant to CPLR 3404 for failure to prosecute. The Civil Court granted the defendants’ motions, and the plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Term of the Supreme Court for Second and Eleventh Judicial Districts.\\nIn a 2-1 decision, the Appellate Term affirmed the Civil Court’s order dismissing the action. In doing so, the Appellate Term overruled several decisions in which that court had held that CPLR 3404 did not apply to Civil Court actions. The plaintiff, by permission of the Appellate Term, appeals to this Court. We reverse.\\nCPLR 3404 provides that “[a] case in the supreme court or a county court marked ‘off’ or struck from the calendar or unanswered on a clerk’s calendar call, and not restored within one year thereafter, shall be deemed abandoned and shall be dismissed without costs for neglect to prosecute.” The Appellate Term majority acknowledged that CPLR 3404, by its terms, applies only to actions in the Supreme Court or the County Court, but concluded that the statute could properly be applied to the lower courts through New York City Civil Court Act § 2102, which provides that “[t]he CPLR and other provisions of law relating to practice and [procedure] in the supreme court, notwithstanding reference by name or classification therein to any other court, shall apply in this court as far as the same can be made applicable and are not in conflict with this act.”\\nAs the Appellate Term dissenting Justice correctly observed, however, CPLR 3404 does in fact conflict with the provision of the Uniform Rules for the New York City Civil Court governing matters marked off the trial calendar (see 22 NYCRR 208.14 [c]), which, unlike CPLR 3404, makes no provision for the dismissal of an action that has been marked off the trial calendar. The Civil Court’s rules previously contained a section which, in language similar to that of CPLR 3404, provided for the automatic dismissal of actions as abandoned if no motion to restore was made within one year after the case was marked off the calendar (see 22 NYCRR former § 2900.17). That provision, however, was repealed, effective January 6, 1986. The Civil Court rule which now governs actions stricken from the calendar (see 22 NYCRR 208.14 [c]) makes no provision for dismissing an action for neglect to prosecute (see LoFredo v CMC Occupational Health Servs., 189 Misc 2d 781 [2001]). The replacement of a provision authorizing dismissal with a provision that does not authorize dismissal presumably reflects a deliberate choice to omit any authorization for such a dismissal. Applying the automatic dismissal provision of CPLR 3404 in Civil Court actions conflicts with that deliberate omission, and, therefore, is not permitted by New York City Civil Court Act § 2102.\\nContrary to the conclusion of the Appellate Term majority, this Court’s decision in Gonzalez v First Natl. Supermarket (232 AD2d 609 [1996]) should not be read as “implicitly approving] of the application of CPLR 3404 in the Civil Court” (Chavez v 407 Seventh Ave. Corp., id. at 35), as the issue of the statute’s applicability was not presented in that case.\\nAccordingly, CPLR 3404 does not apply to Civil Court actions, and the Civil Court had no authority to dismiss this action as abandoned. Therefore, the defendants’ motions, inter alia, to dismiss the action should have been denied.\\nThe parties’ remaining contentions are without merit, are not properly before us, or have been rendered academic in light of our determination.

       "       'text': 'OPINION OF THE COURT\\nCabmen R. Velasquez, J.\\nThe decision and order on this motion by plaintiff, Marvin Johnson, for an order restoring this action to the trial calendar is as follows:\\nThis action, which was commenced in 1995, was marked off the calendar and restored on several occasions. It was last marked off the calendar on January 17, 2002.\\nA pro se motion to restore the action to the trial calendar was submitted on March 26, 2006. This motion was denied by an order of Judge Culley dated May 12, 2006 for failure of the plaintiff to present either an excusable default or a meritorious claim. A subsequent pro se motion for reargument and/or renewal of that motion was denied by an order of Judge Culley dated February 7, 2007. More than two years later, the plaintiff, who is now represented by an attorney, again moves to restore the action to the trial calendar. The instant motion is based upon facts that existed and were relied upon at the time of the determinations made by Judge Culley. Therefore, the decisions rendered by Judge Culley will not be disturbed by this court (see Nong Yaw Trakansook v 39 Wood Realty Corp., 18 AD3d 633 [2005]).\\nThe defendant has not cross-moved to dismiss the action. However, in the opposing affirmations the defendant requests both that plaintiffs motion be denied and the action dismissed. The issue presented is whether this court is precluded from dismissing the action by the Appellate Division, Second Department decision in Chavez v 407 Seventh Ave. Corp. (39 AD3d 454 [2007]), which held that Civil Court actions cannot be dismissed for failure to prosecute since CPLR 3404 does not apply to Civil Court actions.\\nIn the Chavez case, the action had been marked off the calendar three years before the Civil Court granted motions made by the defendants to dismiss the action pursuant to CPLR 3404 for failure to prosecute. The dismissal orders were affirmed by the Appellate Term. However, the Appellate Division, Second Department reversed and denied the motions, ruling unequivocally that “CPLR 3404 does not apply to Civil Court actions, and the Civil Court had no authority to dismiss this action as abandoned.” (Chavez v 407 Seventh Ave. Corp. at 456; see also Harris v Stern & Montana, LLP, 16 Misc 3d 136[A], 2007 NY Slip Op 51619[U] [2007]; LoFredo v CMC Occupational Health Servs., 189 Misc 2d 781 [2001].)\\nThe Appellate Division observed that CPLR 3404 conflicted with the New York City Civil Court rule which governs matters marked off the trial calendar and makes no provision for the dismissal of such actions (see 22 NYCRR 208.14 [c]). The Civil Court rule provides only that such actions may be restored by motion made within one year after the action or proceeding has been stricken. Also noted was the fact that the Legislature had replaced an earlier Civil Court rule, which provided for the automatic dismissal of actions marked off the calendar as abandoned, if no motion to restore was made within one year (see 22 NYCRR former 2900.17), with the current Civil Court rule, which makes no provision for dismissing an action for neglect to prosecute (see 22 NYCRR 208.14 [c]). The Appellate Division reasoned that “[t]he replacement of a provision authorizing dismissal with a provision that does not authorize dismissal presumably reflects a deliberate choice to omit any authorization for such a dismissal.” (Chavez at 456.) Therefore, it concluded that Civil Court actions marked off the calendar cannot be dismissed pursuant to CPLR 3404 for failure to prosecute (id.).\\nIn this case, the dismissal sought by the defendant is not the dismissal for failure to prosecute authorized by CPLR 3404. The defendant’s request for dismissal is predicated upon the plaintiffs inability to establish a reasonable excuse for the failure to restore the action to the calendar within one year and a meritorious cause of action, as required to restore this action to the trial calendar (see Sawak v Brown, 20 Misc 3d 136[A], 2008 NY Slip Op 51536[U] [2008]; Ambrose v Rudzewick, 19 Misc 3d 143[A], 2008 NY Slip Op 51100[U] [2008]). There is no reason to conclude that the Legislature, when it omitted authorization for the dismissal for failure to prosecute of Civil Court actions marked off the calendar for more than one year, intended to preclude the dismissal of Civil Court actions which it has been determined cannot be restored to the trial calendar (see Babickaia v Kanevsky, 20 Misc 3d 1128[A], 2008 NY Slip Op 51650[U] [2008]; 475-481 W. 159th St. Realty Corp. v Gerlain, NYLJ, July 13, 2006, at 22, col 3, 2006 NY Misc LEXIS 2853 [2006]). To allow such actions to remain active, when they cannot be litigated, would unnecessarily clutter the Civil Court records and subject the defendant or defendants to a pending claim which cannot be pursued.\\nAccordingly, the plaintiffs motion to restore this action to the trial calendar is denied and the action is dismissed, without costs or disbursements.',\n",

Goldman, J.), entered on or about June 28, 1989, awarding possession of the subject apartment to petitioner, unanimously affirmed, without costs.\\nIn this owner occupancy proceeding pursuant to Rent Stabilization Code (9 NYCRR) § 2524.4 (a), Civil Court initially dismissed the landlord’s petition, after trial, upon the ground that the 120-150 day notice of non-renewal was defective (Powers v Babic, 141 Misc 2d 344) but Appellate Term reversed and remanded to Civil Court \"for findings of fact on the issue of [petitioner’s] good faith” (Powers v Babic, 143 Misc 2d 58).\\nOn remand, Civil Court, reviewing the pre-remand trial transcript that had been made before it, and without conducting a hearing, concluded that the petitioner did evince the requisite good faith in seeking to recover possession of the apartment for his ailing father and stepmother, and awarded him possession. Respondent moved to vacate this judgment after learning that petitioner’s father had died shortly before Civil Court had rendered its decision. This motion was denied by Civil Court on the ground that Rent Stabilization Code § 2520.6 (n) includes \"stepmother” in the definition of immediate family. Appellate Term unanimously affirmed.\\nContrary to respondent’s contention, Appellate Term’s remand did not require that Civil Court conduct another hearing on the issue of the petitioner’s good faith. Rather, Appellate Term simply recognized that Civil Court, having observed the witnesses’ demeanor and heard their testimony, was in a better position to make findings of fact on the issue of good faith, especially as the issue rested in large measure on considerations relating to the credibility of witnesses (Nightingale Rest. Corp. v Shak Food Corp., 155 AD2d 297). This Civil Court did, after reviewing the record that had been made before it prior to the remand.\\nNor did the death of the petitioner’s father, in the interim, require vacatur of the judgment of possession since the 30-day notice of termination served by petitioner on respondent specifically stated that petitioner intended to recover posses sion of the premises for the use and occupancy of his stepmother as well as his father (Rent Stabilization Code § 2520.6 [n]).

       "       'text': 'OPINION OF THE COURT\\nCarol R. Edmead, J.\\nIn this CPLR article 78 proceeding in the nature of a writ of prohibition, petitioner Annette Da Silva, a defendant in an underlying counsel fees action in Civil Court, New York County (Gold v Da Silva, Civ Ct, NY County, index No. 35449/2009 [the Civil Court action]), seeks an order declaring the decision of the Civil Court (Peter Moulton, J.) which granted summary judgment in favor of respondent David J. Gold, a plaintiff in the Civil Court action, void ab initio, and vacating the judgment entered against Da Silva, on the ground that the Civil Court (Moulton, J.) lacked subject matter jurisdiction because said Civil Court action had previously been dismissed. Da Silva also seeks attorneys’ fees and disbursements.\\nGold moves, pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (2), (4) and (7), to dismiss the instant article 78 proceeding.\\nIn response, Da Silva cross-moves to stay this court’s determination of Gold’s CPLR 3211 dismissal motion, pending reso lution of Da Silva’s motion in the Civil Court to vacate the summary judgment order and the judgment.\\nFactual Background\\nGold, a duly licensed attorney in New York, entered into a contingency fee agreement with Da Silva, a medical services provider, for professional services in litigating a debt collection claim against one of Da Silva’s patients, in the amount of $21,756. Thereafter, as the litigation progressed, Da Silva allegedly refused to appear for depositions and such lack of cooperation ultimately made it impossible for Gold to prosecute her claim. After unsuccessful attempts to collect payment from Da Silva for legal services he performed on her behalf, Gold, on or about September 3, 2009, commenced the Civil Court action against her.\\nOn or about October 13, 2009, Gold moved for summary judgment and on November 4, 2009, the parties appeared before Judge Anil C. Singh, Civil Court, New York County, for a hearing. On the day of the hearing, Judge Singh, at the request of Da Silva who appeared pro se, adjourned the motion, directing that opposition papers be filed by December 4, 2009, and reply papers by January 19, 2010. On the same day, the court clerk, apparently in error, scheduled a date for a pretrial conference on December 14, 2009, which would have been prior to the date indicated by Judge Singh for the submission of the reply papers. Upon the parties’ informing the court of such error, Judge Singh instructed Gold to request an adjournment of the conference date by sending a letter to the court and directed that the parties “need not appear” on December 14. Judge Singh made a hand-written notation to that effect on the order sheet.\\nOn December 14, however, the Civil Court action was erroneously dismissed for the parties’ failure to appear at the conference. Unaware of the dismissal, the parties filed their respective papers on the summary judgment motion as originally directed by Judge Singh.\\nOn February 4, 2010, Judge Peter Moulton granted Gold’s summary judgment motion, and the Clerk of the Civil Court entered a judgment in the amount of $9,426.25 against Da Silva.\\nOn or about May 12, 2010, Da Silva, through her attorney, filed a motion to vacate the order granting summary judgment and the judgment, arguing that the Civil Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction on February 4, 2010 to grant the motion since the action had previously been dismissed and was not properly restored to the calendar.\\nOn June 3, 2010, while the decision on the motion to vacate was pending, Da Silva filed the instant petition seeking to reinstate the December 14, 2009 dismissal of the Civil Court action by Judge Singh, a declaration that the summary judgment order issued by Judge Moulton was void ab initio and to vacate the judgment.\\nGold now moves to dismiss the petition on several grounds: (1) pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (2), for lack of subject matter jurisdiction; (2) pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (4) (another action pending), since Da Silva’s motion to vacate is pending in Civil Court; and (3) pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (7), for failure to state a cause of action against Gold, given that the writ of prohibition sought herein is not an appropriate remedy to address the Civil Court’s alleged lack of authority to grant summary judgment. Thus, the court should dismiss the petition and preclude Da Silva “from further filing of frivolous lawsuits” against Gold.\\nIn response, Da Silva cross-moves for a stay of the determination of Gold’s motion pending resolution of Da Silva’s motion to vacate the Civil Court summary judgment order. It is argued that the stay would not “unduly prejudice” Gold, while allowing Da Silva “to have her day in court.” Da Silva acknowledges that if her motion to vacate is granted by the Civil Court, this proceeding would be moot.\\nDa Silva also argues that this court should deny Gold’s motion because she cannot obtain other relief if this proceeding is dismissed. Da Silva retained counsel after the time for an appeal had expired and filed the instant petition just one day before the expiration of the four-month limitations period for filing a petition for a writ of prohibition. Further, argues Da Silva, she cannot assert a claim directly against Judge Moulton, because he has “absolute judicial privilege and immunity.”\\nIn reply, Gold argues that, since by the order dated September 21, 2010, Judge Singh denied Da Silva’s motion to vacate, her cross motion to stay, before this court, is now moot. Further, since by his September 21, 2010 order, Judge Singh vacated, sua sponte, his December 14, 2009 order of dismissal, admitting the procedural error, the February 4, 2010 order of Judge Moulton granting summary judgment to Gold is valid.\\nFurther, Gold argues that Da Silva cannot commence a proceeding under CPLR 7801 to challenge a Civil Court determination, unless it involves punishing for contempt of the court. Alternatively, even if the Civil Court’s February 4, 2010 ruling (Moulton, J.) was in excess of jurisdiction or power, prohibition is not warranted because Da Silva had another adequate legal remedy — she could have appealed the order or judgment, or moved to reargue or renew. Da Silva cannot now seek a writ of prohibition on the basis that the order and/or judgment are “unappealable” simply because Da Silva did not timely appeal. And, she has requested a review of the February 4, 2010 ruling by filing in the Civil Court a motion to vacate.\\nFinally, Da Silva has not been prejudiced by not being able to properly oppose the merits of the motion since summary judgment was granted after both parties had an opportunity to set forth their respective arguments in their papers. And, in any event, had the error been discovered by the Civil Court and the case been restored to the calendar upon Gold’s motion, the outcome of the motion would ultimately be the same. Thus, the motion to dismiss should be granted.\\nDiscussion\\nCPLR 3211 (a) (2): Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction\\nIn this proceeding, petitioner seeks two forms of relief: (1) a judgment reinstating the Civil Court’s December 14, 2009 dismissal of the Civil Court action; and (2) a judgment declaring the February 4, 2010 Civil Court summary judgment decision void ah initio and a nullity. While Gold asserted “lack of subject matter jurisdiction” (CPLR 3211 [a] [2]) as the basis of dismissal, he sets forth no arguments in support of this ground.\\nNevertheless, CPLR 7801 provides that relief, inter alia, by a “[writ of] prohibition shall be obtained in a proceeding under this article.” CPLR 7803 (2) provides in pertinent part:\\n“The only questions that may be raised in a proceeding under this article are: . . .\\n“2. Whether the body or officer proceeded . . . without or in excess of jurisdiction.”\\nThus, this court may entertain the instant article 78 proceeding pursuant to article VI, § 7 (a) of the New York State Constitution (“The supreme court shall have general original jurisdiction in law and equity”) and pursuant to CPLR 7804 (b) (“A proceeding under this article shall be brought in the supreme court in the county specified in subdivision [b] of section 506 except as that subdivision otherwise provides”).\\nAn article 78 proceeding in the nature of prohibition is designed to prevent an inferior court from proceeding with a judicial matter over which it has no jurisdiction or to prevent it from exceeding its authorized powers in a case over which it has jurisdiction in the first instance (Matter of Voccola v Shilling, 88 Misc 2d 103, 111 [Sup Ct, Kings County 1976], citing Matter of Lee v County Ct. of Erie County, 27 NY2d 432, 436-437 [1971]). Prohibition is an extraordinary remedy issued in the sound discretion of the court where the grievance cannot be redressed by ordinary proceedings at law or in equity (Voccola, citing Matter of Hogan v Court of Gen. Sessions of County of N.Y., 296 NY 1, 8 [1946]). Furthermore, a writ of prohibition is not usually available if there is an adequate remedy by way of appeal (Voccola at 111, citing Matter of Lee v County Ct. of Erie County, 27 NY2d at 437). Nevertheless, where the lower court is exceeding its jurisdiction and the writ furnishes a more effective remedy, it may be availed of even though the error might be corrected by appeal {id).\\nGiven that the Civil Court has dismissed the erroneous dismissal of the Civil Court action and the underlying motion to vacate the Civil Court’s summary judgment was denied (on September 21, 2010), Da Silva’s application herein for a judgment reinstating the Civil Court’s December 14, 2009 dismissal of the Civil Court action and declaring the Civil Court summary judgment decision void, necessarily requires this court to review and overturn said September 21, 2010 order vacating the dismissal. A review of such an order can be had only by direct appeal or by leave to the Appellate Term (Matter of Maddox v Milin, 11 Misc 3d 1091[A], 2006 NY Slip Op 50814[U] [Sup Ct, NY County 2006], citing 22 NYCRR 640.1, 730.1 [b] [denying application to Supreme Court to vacate a Civil Court order for lack of subject matter jurisdiction to vacate orders of the Civil Court]). Thus, dismissal of the petition based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction is warranted.\\nAssuming arguendo that this court had jurisdiction of the issues presented, the court would still be required to dismiss the petition, for the reasons stated below.\\nCPLR 3211 (a) (7): Failure to State a Cause of Action\\nOn a motion to dismiss a petition for failure to state a claim under CPLR 3211 (a) (7) and 7804 (f), the allegations of the petition, and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from those allegations, must be accepted as true and the petition must be liberally construed in favor of the petitioner (Violi v New York State Dept. of Motor Vehs., 15 Misc 3d 1044 [Sup Ct, Westchester County 2007], citing Matter of 10 E. Realty, LLC v Incorporated Vil. of Val. Stream, 17 AD3d 472 [2d Dept 2005]; Anguita v Koch, 179 AD2d 454 [1st Dept 1992]). The central question on a motion to dismiss is whether the petition’s allegations state a legally cognizable claim (Held v Kaufman, 91 NY2d 425 [1998]). The court’s role is simply to determine whether the facts, as alleged, fit into any valid legal theory (Sokoloff v Harriman Estates Dev. Corp., 96 NY2d 409 [2001]).\\nWhen a petitioner seeks relief in the nature of prohibition, pursuant to CPLR 7803 (2), the court must make a two-tiered analysis. “It must first determine whether the issue presented is the type for which the remedy may be granted and, if it is, whether prohibition is warranted by the merits of the claim” (Matter of Holtzman v Goldman, 71 NY2d 564, 568 [1988]).\\nProhibition is an extraordinary remedy which is available only when a clear legal right to relief exists, and, in cases where judicial authority is challenged, when the court acted “or threatens to act either without jurisdiction or in excess of its authorized powers” (Matter of Neal v White, 46 AD3d 156, 159 [1st Dept 2007]; Matter of Hirschfeld v Friedman, 307 AD2d 856, 858 [1st Dept 2003], citing Matter of Holtzman v Goldman, 71 NY2d 564, 569 [1988]). Although the distinction between legal errors and actions in excess of power is not always easy to discern, “abuses of power may be identified by their impact upon the entire proceeding as distinguished from an error in a proceeding itself proper” (Matter of Johnson v Price, 28 AD3d 79, 82 [1st Dept 2006], quoting Matter of Holtzman v Goldman, 71 NY2d at 569). Moreover, “prohibition is available only when a court exceeds its juris diction in a manner that implicates the legality of the proceeding itself” (Johnson v Price at 82, quoting Matter ofHirschfeld v Friedman, 307 AD2d at 858; Matter of Doe v Axelrod, 71 NY2d 484, 490 [1988]; see also Matter of Pirro v Angiolillo, 89 NY2d 351 [1996]; Matter of State of New York v King, 36 NY2d 59, 62 [1975]).\\nProhibition is never available, however, “merely to correct or prevent trial errors of substantive law or procedure, however grievous” (Matter of Hirschfeld v Friedman, 307 AD2d 856, 858 [2003], quoting La Rocca v Lane, 37 NY2d 575, 579 [1975], cert denied 424 US 968 [1976]). Rather, the “orderly administration of justice requires that correction of litigation errors merely be left to the ordinary channels of appeal or review” (Matter of National Equip. Corp. v Ruiz, 19 AD3d 5, 11 [1st Dept 2005], quoting La Rocca v Lane, 37 NY2d at 579). Thus,\\n“[the remedy of] prohibition does not issue as of right, but only in the sound discretion of the court, [taking into consideration such factors as] the harm caused by the excess of power, the availability or unavailability of an adequate remedy on appeal or at law or in equity, and the remedial effectiveness of prohibition if such an adequate remedy does not exist” (Matter of Greenwald v Scheinman, 94 AD2d 842, 844 [1983], lv denied 60 NY2d 551 [1983] [citations omitted]).\\nIn this proceeding, prohibition does not lie because Da Silva failed to demonstrate a clear legal right to relief through prohibition.\\nEven if the court were to assume that the February 4, 2010 summary judgment decision was erroneously issued in the absence of the statutory power, as the Court of Appeals held, “errors of law . . . are not to be confused with a proper basis for using the extraordinary writ” (Matter of State of New York v King, 36 NY2d 59, 62 [1975]), and even “egregious errors in pretrial and trial rulings, such as the erroneous exclusion of important evidence, do not form a proper basis for an article 78 challenge, regardless of the fact that [a party] ha[s] no appellate recourse to correct the ruling” (Matter of Johnson v Price, 28 AD3d 79, 81 [2006], citing Matter of Hirschfeld v Friedman, 307 AD2d 856 [2003]).\\nBased on the record, the parties’ failure to appear at the December 14, 2009 pretrial conference resulted in an inadvertent dismissal of the Civil Court action (Singh, J.), which was apparently not reflected in the Civil Court’s records. Thus, even though the action was dismissed and not properly restored to the calendar, Judge Moulton, in deciding the summary judgment motion as it was presented to him, acted under the color-able right of judicial authority. Furthermore, by virtue of the adjournment, requested by the parties, both Gold and Da Silva had an opportunity to litigate the merits of the motion. Therefore, under the circumstances, Judge Moulton’s February 4, 2010 decision was, at most (and that is not this court’s finding), an “error of procedural or substantive law,” and not “an action taken in the absence of the necessary authority to act” (Matter of Johnson v Price, 28 AD3d at 82) warranting the remedy of a writ of prohibition.\\nMoreover, even if “an act in excess of power” is perceived, the appropriate vehicle for challenging the propriety of the Civil Court’s summary judgment determination was a direct appeal from that order (see Matter of DeVincenzo v Morgenthau, 161 AD2d 476 [1st Dept 1990]). Additionally, prohibition is not available where its proponent has an adequate alternative remedy at law, and Da Silva was not without “another adequate remedy” since she has sought relief from Judge Moulton’s order by a motion to vacate pursuant to CPLR 5015 (a) (Matter of Crain Communications v Hughes, 74 NY2d 626 [1989]). Indeed, the appropriate remedy to review any claimed error in a Civil Court order or judgment is through the appellate process (Matter of McGuire v Spires, 214 AD2d 402 [1st Dept 1995]; see also 22 NYCRR 640.1, 730.1 (b); NY Const, art VI, § 8). Therefore, a writ of prohibition will not lie and the instant petition must be dismissed (see Maddox, supra).\\nIn light of the foregoing, and, accepting the allegations of Da Silva’s petition as true, the court concludes that the challenged action of the Civil Court is not “the type of issue for which the remedy of a writ of prohibition may be granted” and, thus, Da Silva failed to state a claim warranting relief in the nature of a writ of prohibition (Matter of DeVincenzo v Morgenthau, 161 AD2d 476 [1990]; see Matter of Gold v Gartenstein, 54 NY2d 627 [1981]).\\nAccordingly, Gold’s motion to dismiss the petition is granted and, in view of the denial of Da Silva’s Civil Court motion to vacate, her instant cross motion for a stay pending a determination by the Civil Court, is denied.\\nConclusion\\nBased on the foregoing, it is hereby ordered and adjudged that the motion of the respondent David J. Gold for an order dismissing the petition of Annette Da Silva is granted pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (2) and (7), and the petition is hereby dismissed; and it is further ordered that the cross motion of the petitioner to stay the determination of respondent Gold’s motion is denied.\\n1\\n. To the extent that Da Silva seeks a writ of prohibition, the court treats such application as an article 78 proceeding even though Da Silva’s pleading contains no reference to article 78 (Goldman v White Plains Ctr. for Nursing Care, LLC, 9 Misc 3d 977, 801 [Sup Ct, NY County 2005] [article 78 was designed to facilitate requests for relief based on the common-law writs of mandamus, prohibition and certiorari without regard to the technical distinctions between them]).\\n2\\n. The court notes that Gold asserted no arguments in his initial moving papers to support this claim.\\n3\\n. The court notes that on September 21, 2010, after Da Silva filed the instant petition with this court, the Civil Court (Singh, J.) denied her motion to vacate the summary judgment decision.\\n4\\n. Dismissal pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (4) on the ground that the underlying Civil Court action is pending is unwarranted. At the time of the instant motion, Da Silva’s motion to vacate was pending in the Civil Court. However, on September 21, 2010, Judge Singh, sua sponte, vacated his December 14, 2009 order of dismissal as a procedural error, and Da Silva’s motion to vacate the summary judgment order was essentially denied. In view of such disposition of Da Silva’s Civil Court motion, the Civil Court action is no longer pending, and dismissal of the petition pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (4) is denied.\\n[5]\\n5. CPLR 506 (b) provides: “Proceeding against body or officer. A proceeding against a body or officer shall be commenced in any county within the judicial district where the respondent made the determination complained of.”\\n6\\n. Section 208.14 (b) (3) of the Uniform Rules for Trial Courts (22 NYCRR) provides: “If no party appears, the judge may strike the action from the calendar or make such other order as appears just.”\\n7\\n. Pursuant to Uniform Rules for Trial Courts (22 NYCRR) § 208.14 (c), “[a]ctions stricken from the calendar may be restored to the calendar only upon stipulation of all parties so ordered by the court or by motion on notice to all other parties, made within one year after the action is stricken.”',\n",

       "       'text': 'OPINION OF THE COURT\\nLeventhal, J.\\nOn this appeal, we are asked to decide whether the 20-day time period to file proof of service of process, when service is made upon a person of suitable age and discretion pursuant to CPLR 308 (2), applies to an action commenced in the Civil Court of the City of New York. For the reasons discussed below, we find that the 20-day time period does not apply.\\nIn August 2007 the plaintiff commenced this action in the Civil Court of the City of New York, Queens County (hereinafter the Civil Court), to recover damages for personal injuries against Perdomo M. Rodriguez, Gabriel Perez, and Carmen Perez. The plaintiff alleged that on June 11, 2005, he was a passenger in a vehicle owned and operated by Rodriguez which collided with another vehicle owned by Carmen Perez and operated by Gabriel Perez. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants’ combined negligence and recklessness in the operation of the respective vehicles was the proximate cause of the serious injuries he allegedly sustained as a result of the accident.\\nAccording to the affidavit of service from the plaintiffs process server dated December 18, 2007, a copy of the summons and complaint was delivered to Rodriguez’s wife at his home on December 13, 2007. On the following day, the plaintiffs process server mailed copies of those documents to Rodriguez’s residence. However, proof of service was not filed with the Civil Court until January 2, 2009, more than one year after “suitable age and discretion” service was effected. Rodriguez did not appear in the action or answer the complaint.\\nOn March 4, 2009, the plaintiff filed a notice of inquest against Rodriguez only. On July 14, 2009, following an inquest, judgment was entered against Rodriguez and in favor of the plaintiff in the principal sum of $25,000. In September 2009, the plaintiff commenced a separate action against Long Island Insurance Company, Rodriguez’s insurer, to enforce the judgment.\\nIn February 2010, Rodriguez moved pursuant to CPLR 2004 and 2005 to vacate the default judgment upon the grounds that “said default upon which the judgment was entered into should not have been granted, was excusable and was based upon a meritorious defense.” In an affidavit, Rodriguez averred that neither he nor his wife were ever served with the summons and complaint.\\nIn an order entered February 17, 2010, the Civil Court granted Rodriguez’s motion to vacate the default judgment in “the interest of justice,” stressing the strong public policy in favor of resolving cases on the merits. The plaintiff then appealed to the Appellate Term for the Second, Eleventh, and Thirteenth Judicial Districts (hereinafter the Appellate Term). Before the Appellate Term, the plaintiff contended that since service had allegedly been effected by delivering the summons and complaint to Rodriguez’s wife, he was required to submit an affidavit from her in order to rebut the presumption of proper service created by the process server’s affidavit of service. As Rodriguez failed to submit an affidavit from his wife, and failed to explain that failure, the plaintiff argued that the Civil Court erred in vacating the default judgment.\\nBy order dated March 2, 2011, the Appellate Term affirmed the order of the Civil Court (36 Misc 3d 76 [2011]). Initially, the Appellate Term agreed with the plaintiff that Rodriguez’s affidavit in support of his motion “was insufficient to refute the presumption of proper service created by the affidavit of plaintiffs process server” (id. at 77). Nevertheless, the Appel late Term found that the plaintiffs failure to file proof of service within the 20-day period set forth in CPLR 308 (2) rendered the default judgment a nullity. In reaching its conclusion, the Appellate Term reasoned:\\n“CPLR 308 (2) requires that where, as here, service is made by delivering the summons within the state to a person of suitable age and discretion followed by mailing, ‘proof of such service shall be filed with the clerk of the court designated in the summons within twenty days of either such delivery or mailing, whichever is effected later; service shall be complete ten days after such filing . . . .’ The New York City Civil Court Act similarly requires the filing of proof of service to complete service (CCA 410 [b]), and specifies that service of the summons and complaint shall be made within 120 days of the filing of the summons and complaint (CCA 411; cf. CPLR 306-b). In the Civil Court, following the filing of proof of service, which completes substituted service (see Siegel, Practice Commentaries, McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 29A, CCA 402; cf CPLR 308 [2] [service is complete 10 days after proof of service is filed]), the defendant has 30 days within which to appear and answer (CCA 402 [b]).\\n“The rules set forth in the Civil Practice Law and Rules respecting the filing of proof of service in the event of substituted service by the ‘nail and mail’ method are identical to the rules for filing proof of service in the event of substituted service by service on a person of suitable age and discretion followed by mailing (compare CPLR 308 [2] with CPLR 308 [4]). In Discover Bank v Eschwege (71 AD3d 1413 [2010]), where the plaintiff served by the ‘nail and mail’ method (see CPLR 308 [4]) but, without obtaining judicial permission to do so, filed proof of service more than 20 days following such service, the Appellate Division, Fourth Department, vacated the default judgment that had been entered against the defendant; in so doing, that court commented that, while the failure to file proof of service within the time specified in CPLR 308 (4) was not a jurisdictional defect but was rather a ‘procedural irregularity’ that could be cured by an order permit-\\n“Here, without obtaining an order permitting late filing, plaintiff filed proof of service of the summons with endorsed complaint approximately 375 days after serving defendant Rodriguez by substituted service pursuant to CPLR 308 (2). As there was no order permitting the late filing of plaintiffs proof of service, the default judgment ‘was a nullity requiring vacatur’ (id.), and we conclude that the Civil Court did not improvidently exercise its discretion in granting defendant Rodriguez’s motion to vacate the default judgment that had been entered against him. Accordingly, the order of the Civil Court is affirmed” (Rodriguez v Rodriguez, 31 Misc 3d 76, 77-78 [2011]).\\nThe plaintiff moved for leave to reargue his opposition to Rodriguez’s motion to vacate, or, in the alternative, for leave to appeal to this Court. In support of his motion, the plaintiff argued, among other things, that the Appellate Term erred in applying the 20-day time period to file proof of service pursuant to CPLR 308 (2) to this action because the New York City Civil Court Act (hereinafter the CCA) has its own provisions regarding the filing of proof of service.\\nIn an order dated May 23, 2011, the Appellate Term denied the plaintiffs motion (2011 NY Slip Op 74017[U] [2011]). By decision and order on motion dated August 31, 2011, this Court granted the plaintiffs motion for leave to appeal from the order dated March 2, 2011 (2011 NY Slip Op 82318[U] [2011]). On appeal, the plaintiff contends that the 20-day time period for filing proof of service pursuant to CPLR 308 (2) is not applicable to an action commenced in the Civil Court.\\nThis action was commenced in the Civil Court to recover damages for personal injuries in a sum not exceeding $25,000, which is the maximum amount recoverable in that court (see CCA 202). According to the affidavit of service submitted by the plaintiff, Rodriguez was served by service upon a person of “suitable age and discretion,” in that, on December 13, 2007, the summons and complaint were left with Rodriguez’s wife, at his home, and the summons and complaint were mailed to Rodriguez’s home on the following day. Service upon a party by way of delivery to a person of “suitable age and discretion” and then mailing is not explicitly provided for in the CCA. However, CCA 403, entitled “Summons; method and place of service,” effectively incorporates the method of service provisions of the CPLR by providing, as pertinent here, that “[s]ervice of summons shall be made in the manner prescribed in supreme court practice” (see Matter of Ebanks v Skyline NYC, LLC, 70 AD3d 943, 944 [2010]; see also CCA 400 [2]).\\nCPLR 308 (2), in turn, provides that personal service upon a person can be made\\n“by delivering the summons within the state to a person of suitable age and discretion at the . . . dwelling place or usual place of abode of the person to be served and by . . . mailing the summons to the person to be served at his or her last known residence ... in an envelope bearing the legend ‘personal and confidential’ . . . such delivery and mailing to be effected within twenty days of each other.”\\nThe affidavit of service submitted by the plaintiff’s process server complied with these provisions.\\nHowever, CPLR 308 (2) further provides that “proof of such service shall be filed with the clerk of the court designated in the summons within twenty days of either such delivery or mailing, whichever is effected later; service shall be complete ten days after such filing.” The plaintiff asserts that this provision requiring the filing of proof of service is not applicable to an action brought in Civil Court. In support of this contention, the plaintiff relies upon the history of article 4 of the CCA.\\nPrior to 2005, CCA 409 required that a copy of a summons and complaint with proof of service be filed within 14 days after service. In September 2005, various provisions of the CCA were amended in order to implement a commencement by filing system in the Civil Court (see L 2005, ch 452; Siegel, Practice Commentaries, McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 29A, NY City Civ Ct Act § 411, 2012 Pocket Part at 63) which was analogous to the commencement by filing system in effect in, inter alia, the Supreme Court (see CPLR 304; L 1992, ch 216). As pertinent here, CCA 409 was amended to provide that “[p]roof of service of the summons and complaint. . . shall be filed with the clerk of the court in the county in which the action is brought” (CCA 409 [a]).\\nThe 2005 amendment of CCA 409 eliminated the 14-day time period to file proof of service in an action commenced in the Civil Court. Discussing the import of the amendment in a practice commentary, Professor David Siegel notes that “ [section 409 was amended in 2005 to eliminate all reference to time periods for filing proof of service, substituting a simple requirement that the proof be filed with the clerk of the civil court in the county of venue, but specifying no time limit” (Siegel, Practice Commentaries, McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 29A, NY City Civ Ct Act § 409, 2012 Pocket Part at 60).\\nAnother provision relevant to our consideration is CCA 411. As part of the implementation of a commencement by filing system in the Civil Court, CCA 411 currently provides that service of a summons and complaint must be made within 120 days of the filing thereof and permits a court, upon good cause shown, to extend the time for service. In addition, under the CCA’s scheme for service of process, unless service is made by personal deliveiy, service in the Civil Court is complete upon filing of proof of service (see CCA 402 [b]; 410). By contrast, where a defendant is served by personal delivery, service is complete immediately (see CCA 402 [a]; 410).\\nA review of the foregoing provisions makes clear that the 20-day time period to file proof of service contained in CPLR 308 (2) was never applicable to an action commenced in the Civil Court because, prior to 2005, proof of service had to be filed within 14 days of service. Presently, there is no deadline to file proof of service in an action commenced in the Civil Court (see CCA 409). In practical terms, this means that a defendant’s time to answer a complaint in the Civil Court is not triggered until proof of service is filed, unless that defendant was personally served (see CCA 402 [if personally served, a defendant has 20 days to appear and answer; if not personally served, a defendant has 30 days from filing of proof of service to appear and answer]; 410).\\nCCA 2102, entitled “Civil practice; general provisions; CPLR applicable,” states: “The CPLR and other provisions of law relating to practice and procedure in the supreme court, notwithstanding reference by name or classification therein to any other court, shall apply in this court as far as the same can be made applicable and are not in conflict with this act” (emphasis added).\\nJust such a conflict would be created if the CPLR 308 (2) 20-day deadline for filing proof of service is applied to Civil Court actions. Considering that CCA 409 previously required a plaintiff to file proof of service (except with personal delivery) within 14 days of service, and the current version of CCA 409 eliminated the 14-day time period for filing proof of service, the application of the 20-day time period to file proof of service set forth in CPLR 308 (2) conflicts with CCA 409. The replacement of that portion of CCA 409 which required the filing of proof of service within 14 days of service, with a provision deleting such a deadline, reflects a deliberate choice by the legislature to discard a specific time period to file proof of service in actions commenced in the Civil Court. Moreover, while some may question why no deadline was imposed by the legislature for the filing of proof of service in a Civil Court action, it is not for the courts to legislate such a deadline. If the legislature deems it prudent to require a plaintiff to file proof of service with the clerk of the Civil Court within a certain time period, it can enact such legislation. For example, the legislature can mandate that the filing provisions of CPLR 308 (2) apply to the filing of proof of service in Civil Court actions. Absent any legislative directive, we are constrained to allow the plaintiff to file his proof of service more than one year after such service.\\nThus, the Appellate Term should not have applied the 20-day time period to file proof of service set forth in CPLR 308 (2), as that provision conflicts with the current version of CCA 409 (see CCA 2102). Since the current version of CCA 409 does not include a deadline for filing the proof of service, the Appellate Term erred when it found that the plaintiffs filing of the proof of service approximately 375 days after serving Rodriguez was untimely (cf. Chavez v 407 Seventh Ave. Corp., 39 AD3d 454 [2007]).\\nRodriguez’s reliance upon Discover Bank v Eschwege (71 AD3d 1413 [2010]) to impose a 20-day time period to file proof service pursuant to CPLR 308 (2) is misplaced, as that case involved an action commenced in the Supreme Court, not the Civil Court.\\nOnce proof of filing of service in this case was actually filed on January 2, 2009, service became complete. Accordingly, Rodriguez had 20 days to answer or move to extend his time. He did neither. Hence, Rodriguez defaulted. As the Appellate Term correctly determined, Rodriguez’s affidavit submitted in support of his motion was insufficient to vacate the judgment. Although Rodriguez did not specify which paragraph of CPLR 5015 (a) he relied upon, his affidavit suggested that he was seeking to vacate his default pursuant to CPLR 5015 (a) (4) on the ground of lack of jurisdiction. However, he failed to demonstrate his entitlement to vacatur on this ground.\\nThe affidavit from the plaintiffs process server constituted prima facie evidence of proper service pursuant to CPLR 308 (2), and Rodriguez’s unsubstantiated denial of receipt was insufficient to rebut the presumption of proper service (see US Natl. Bank Assn, v Melton, 90 AD3d 742 [2011]; Prospect Park Mgt., LLC v Beatty, 73 AD3d 885, 886 [2010]; Sturino v Nino Tripicchio & Son Landscaping, 65 AD3d 1327 [2009]; Beneficial Homeowner Serv. Corp. v Girault, 60 AD3d 984 [2009]; Mortgage Elec. Registration Sys., Inc. v Schotter, 50 AD3d 983 [2008]). Furthermore, since Rodriguez did not submit an affidavit from his wife, to whom the summons and complaint were delivered, Rodriguez failed to rebut the presumption of proper service.\\nRodriguez’s remaining contention is without merit.\\nAccordingly, the order of the Appellate Term dated March 2, 2011, is reversed, on the law, the order of the Civil Court entered February 17, 2010, is reversed, and Rodriguez’s motion, in effect, pursuant to CPLR 5015 (a) (4) to vacate the judgment of the Civil Court entered July 14, 2009, is denied.\\nRivera, J.P, Angiolillo and Cohen, JJ., concur.\\nOrdered that the order of the Appellate Term for the Second, Eleventh, and Thirteenth Judicial Districts dated March 2, 2011, is reversed, on the law, with costs, the order of the Civil Court of the City of New York, Queens County, entered February 17, 2010, is reversed, and the motion of the defendant Perdomo M. Rodriguez, in effect, pursuant to CPLR 5015 (a) (4) to vacate the judgment of the same court entered July 14, 2009, is denied.',\n",

       "       'text': 'Order, Supreme Court, New York County (Alice Schlesinger, J.), entered March 11, 2003, which, in an action by a residential cooperative against defendant tenants-shareholders to recover damages with regard to defendants’ apartments, granted defendants’ motion for an injunction staying a Civil Court summary holdover proceeding commenced by plaintiff, unanimously reversed, on the law, without costs, and the motion denied. Appeal from order, same court and Justice, entered March 10, 2003, unanimously dismissed, without costs, as abandoned.\\nPlaintiff landlord commenced a breach of contract and fraud action against its tenants in Supreme Court. About two years later, plaintiff commenced a summary holdover proceeding in Civil Court. The parties moved and cross-moved for summary judgment on the claims and counterclaims in the Supreme Court action. The resulting order is not at issue on appeal. Defendants also moved in the Supreme Court for an injunction staying the summary holdover proceeding and to strike the notice of termination. Although observing that “there is not perfect coincidence between the Civil Court proceeding[ ] and th[is action],” the court nevertheless found that “there is certainly a great deal of coincidence” and that the essence of both was “improper alterations and the like.” Consequently, the Supreme Court granted a stay conditioned upon defendants’ payment of use and occupancy in addition to monthly maintenance and apparently did not address that branch of the motion to strike the notice of termination.\\nWe reverse. The Civil Court is the preferred forum for resolving landlord-tenant issues (see Post v 120 E. End Ave. Corp., 62 NY2d 19 [1984]; Cohen v Goldfein, 100 AD2d 795 [1984]). Indeed, “[o]nly where Civil Court is without authority to grant the relief sought should the prosecution of a summary proceeding be stayed” (Scheff v 230 E. 73rd Owners Corp., 203 AD2d 151, 152 [1994]). Thus, given the strong preference for resolving landlord-tenant disputes in Civil Court due to its unique ability to resolve such issues, the Supreme Court erred in staying the summary holdover proceeding. Even if there were no strong preference for adjudicating landlord-tenant proceedings in Civil Court, defendants here did not make the requisite prima facie showing to obtain an injunction staying the summary holdover proceeding (see CPLR 6301, 6312; Koultukis v Phillips, 285 AD2d 433 [2001]).\\nAlthough on the face of the appellate record presented, neither side requested consolidation before the nisi prius court, both sides, on appeal, make perfunctory requests to consolidate the Supreme Court action and Civil Court proceeding. However, consolidation is inappropriate given the distinct nature of the respective causes and the prejudice to plaintiff in depriving it of the appropriate recognized forum for a summary holdover proceeding (see CPLR 602; Post, supra, 62 NY2d at 28 [Civil Court has jurisdiction of landlord/tenant disputes and when it can decide dispute, “it is desirable that it do so”]). Moreover, neither side contends that the Civil Court is incapable of determining the holdover proceeding, “and, thus, . . . ha[s] not established the necessity for consolidation” (Scheff, supra, 203 AD2d at 152).

       "       'text': \"PEARSON, Judge.\\nLeroy J. Blackwelder and Mary Louise Blackwelder, his wife, filed their complaint in the Circuit Court of Dade County, Florida, against Charles J. Bodner and prayed for the foreclosure of a certain deed which they alleged to be a mortgage. The defendant, Bodner filed a verified answer in which he alleged that the property was not subject to the claimed mortgage by reason of the fact that his predecessor in title had secured a judgment in the Civil Court of Record, in and for Dade County, Florida, and had thereafter in supplementary proceedings secured an order of a judge of the civil court of record which set aside and declared void the deed sought to be foreclosed. The legal title to the real estate upon which the foreclosure was prayed was in Bodner by virtue of a deed he received from the purchaser at a sale held upon levy of execution from the civil court of record.\\nA summary final decree for the defendant was entered upon the deposition of Leroy J. Blackwelder, the pleadings, exhibits and testimony in the court file of the civil court of record case. The plaintiffs appeal from this summary final decree and we reverse.\\nIt appears from the record that the grantor of the deed sought to be foreclosed as a mortgage was D’Ercole Enterprises, a corporation. The deed was dated December 20, 1956. This company was, on May 29, 1957, sued in the civil court of record by Steelco of Miami, Inc. Judgment was secured in said suit on July 16, 1957. Thereafter, proceeding under section 55.55, Fla.Stat., F.S.A., Steelco secured an order from the civil court of record which held the conveyance from D’Er-cole to Blackwelder to be in fraud of creditors and further held that the deed was void. The court then set the deed aside and directed that levy should be made against the property. Pursuant to this order of the civil court of record the judgment sale was had and Steelco became the purchaser of the property involved. Subsequently Steelco conveyed to Bodner, who is the appellee here.\\nThe summary final decree was in part as follows:\\n“4. Said deed from D’Ercole Enterprises, Inc. to Leroy J. Blackwelder, filed December 21, 1956 in Deed Book 4380, Page 450, aforesaid, was held to be without consideration and fraudulent to creditors of D’Ercole Enterprises, Inc. by prior Order and Judgment of the Civil Court of Record.\\n“5. The deed dated June 12, 1957, filed June 13, 1957, in official records book 287, page 434, from Leroy J. Blackwelder and Mary Louise Black-welder, his wife, to Mary Louise Blackwelder, conveying Lots 13, 14 and IS of Block 78, above described was held to be without consideration, and was fraudulent to creditors of D’Ercole Enterprises, Inc. by prior Order and Judgment of the Civil Court of Record.\\n“6. Leroy J. Blackwelder has no legal or equitable interest in the property in question, and any such interest he may have had in said property he conveyed to his wife, Mary Louise Blackwelder.\\n“7. The judgment, the execution and the sale of the premises in question thereunder, taken as aforesaid in the Civil Court of Record, and the subsequent appeal, are dispositive of the issues' raised by the plaintiffs in this action and are res judicata and may not be collaterally attacked by these proceedings.”\\nThe appellant has filed 9 assignments of error, number 7 of which is as follows:\\n“The Court erred in holding that the judgment of the Civil Court of Record referred to in Paragraph ‘C’ of said Decree was effective inasmuch as the Court had no jurisdiction over the subject matter or of the parties, so as to entitle it to accomplish’ that result.”\\nWe find this assignment to be well taken. [The remaining assignments of error have been considered but no reversible error is found therein.]\\nThe Civil Court • of Record in and for Dade County, Florida, is a statutory court. A limitation upon the jurisdiction of the Civil Court of Record in and for Dade County, Florida, is provided by Article V, section 6 of the Constitution of the State of Florida, 26 F.S.A., which expressly states that the circuit courts shall have exclusive original jurisdiction in all cases in equity and “all actions involving the titles or boundaries of real estate, * * *.” This language has been construed by the Supreme Court of Florida in Barrs v. State, 95 Fla. 75, 116 So. 28, to mean that where the necessary result of a judgment is that one party gains or the other party loses an interest in real estate, the circuit court has jurisdiction.\\nThe powers granted to courts upon proceedings supplementary to execution unsatisfied by section 55.55 Fla.Stat, F.S.A., may not diminish the constitutional powers granted exclusively to the circuit courts. Therefore the order of judgment of the civil court of record, holding that the deed from D’Ercole to Black-welder to be void, was beyond the jurisdiction of that court; as such it was without legal effect and was not a bar to the present action by-Blackwelder to foreclose the deed as a mortgage.\\nHowever, it affirmatively appears from the summary final decree entered by the chancellor that he did not base his decision entirely -'upon the findings included in the paragraphs above quoted. Therefore it does not follow that the summary final decree is erroneous. Nevertheless, since it is apparent that the decree was entered under a misapprehension as to the effect of the order of the civil court of record, we reverse the summary final decree and return the cause to the trial judge for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\\nReversed and remanded for further proceedings.\\nHORTON, C. J., and CARROLL, CHAS., J., concur.\\n1\\n. “55.55 Proceedings supplementary; application of property to satisfaction of execution. — The judge may order any property of the judgment debtor not exempt from execution, in the hands of either himself or any other person or due to the judgment debtor, to be applied toward the satisfaction of the judgment debt.”\\n2\\n. Chap. 33, Ma.Stat., F.S.A.\\n3\\n. Actually Const. Art. 5, § 11, 26 F.S.A., was interpreted in the Barrs ease, supra, but the language construed is the same as that contained in the present amendment.\\n4\\n.See note 1, supra.\",\n",

Under ch. 320, Laws of 1913, the circuit court can reverse a judgment of the civil court upon appeal and grant a new trial in the circuit court only when by reason of “manifest prejudicial error, . . . any party thereto has not had a fair trial thereof in the civil court,” and then only “where substantial justice cannot otherwise be done and the rights of the parties other wise preserved and protected.” It was error, therefore, to grant a new trial absolutely on the ground of excessive damages.\\n3. Where damages allowed in the civil court are manifestly excessive, the circuit court upon appeal may, if they were allowed by the civil judge, reduce the amount of the recovery, or, if the excessive allowance was by a jury in the civil court, may make an alternative order giving respondent an option to avoid a new trial by accepting a smaller sum.\\nAppeal from an order of the circuit court for Milwaukee county: J. 0.

       "       'text': \"Timlin, J.\\nSec. 3069, Stats., provides that an order made by the circuit court granting a new trial may be carried by appeal to the supreme court. This provision long antedates the establishment of the civil court in Milwaukee, and no «doubt originally- applied only to orders made by the circuit •court in cases tried by that court. ,\\nBy ch. 549, Laws of 1909, the civil court of Milwaukee county is established with powers and jurisdiction therein specified. Provision is made in sub. 1 -of sec. 28 of that chapter for an appeal to the circuit court for Milwaukee county from any final judgment of said civil court or from any order of the civil court from which an appeal to the supreme court might be taken if such order were made by a circuit court. We are unable to limit the scope of these words found in .sec. 3069 merely on the ground that this statute existed before tbe civil court was established and before tbe circuit court was given tbe power in tbis case exercised. We must bold tbe order appealable; altbougb a case is presented where tbe legislature might properly cut off an appeal and allow a review on appeal from tbe final judgment only.\\nOb. 320, Laws of 1913, following sec. 28, cb. 549, Laws of 1909, provides that every judgment of tbe civil court shall be affirmed or modified and affirmed as so modified by tbe circuit court upon appeal, unless, by reason of manifest prejudicial error in tbe trial of tbe action in which such judgment was rendered, any party thereto has not bad a fair trial thereof in tbe civil court; but in any such case of mistrial, where substantial justice cannot otherwise be done and tbe rights of tbe parties otherwise preserved and protected, tbe judgment of tbe civil court therein shall be reversed, and tbe circuit court shall order tbe action tried in said circuit court in tbe same manner as if originally brought there, except, etc.\\nIt is quite apparent that reversing a judgment of tbe civil court .and ordering a new trial absolutely on tbe ground of excessive damages is in violation of tbis express statute. Eor the judgment is not to be reversed and a new trial ordered even when tbe grave errors described in tbis statute have occurred, except when substantial justice cannot otherwise be done and tbe rights of tbe parties cannot otherwise be preserved. But in all cases of excessive allowance of damages by tbe civil judge, tbe circuit judge, if warranted by tbe evidence, may reduce tbe amount of recovery, and in all cases of excessive allowance of damages by a jury in the civil court tbe circuit court may make tbe alternative order described in Rueping v. C. & N. W. R. Co. 123 Wis. 319, 101 N. W. 710; Heimlich v. Tabor, 123 Wis. 565, 102 N. W. 10; Beach v. Bird & W. L. Co. 135 Wis. 550, 116 N. W. 245; Secard v. Rhinelander L. Co. 147 Wis. 614, 133 N. W. 45.\\nTbis might end the case and is also a valuable right of tbe respondent in that court, giving him tbe option of ending tbe litigation then and there, and it obviates tbe necessity of a new trial in ease tbe order is accepted by either party. Therefore, by following the cases above cited substantial justice may be done without compelling a new trial, consequently the circuit court is to follow this course. The order here appealed from was therefore in violation'.of statute and must be reversed. In all cases where the amount of damages awarded by the judge of the civil court is up fof review in the circuit court, the circuit court is not to disturb the award unless there is manifest error. If the circuit court has acted thereon, this court will sustain the ruling of the circuit court whenever that can be done upon the evidence. There seems to be an opinion prevalent that the statute in question enlarges the power of the circuit court to reverse judgments of the civil court on appeal. We understand the statute restricts such power in a considerable degree. That is, not only must there be error discovered, but that error must be manifest — that is, clearly apparent, — it must also be prejudicial to the party appealing, and it must also have deprived him- of a fair trial. Even then such error is to be corrected in some other way than by granting a new trial except in those cases in which substantial justice cannot otherwise he accomplished.\\nBy the Gourt.- — Order reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings according to law.\",\n",

The Grievance Committee now moves to confirm the Special Referee’s report and to impose such discipline upon the respondent as the Court may deem just and proper. The respondent opposes the Grievance Committee’s motion.\\nCharges one and two of the petition are predicated upon a common set of factual allegations, as follows:\\nThe respondent filed a motion for summary judgment dated July 4, 2003, in Civil Court, Queens County, on behalf of GPM Chiropractic, PC., in an action entitled GPM Chiropractic, P.C., as Assignee of Martinez Lydia v Nationwide Ins.

By decision and order dated June 22, 2004, the Civil Court denied the motion “due to [the plaintiffs] failure to submit a properly signed affidavit of merit. Although the affidavit submitted in support of the motion states to be by Ernest Horowitz, M.D., the signature page, which does not contain an original signature, indicates that it was signed by Paul Mostun, D.C.”\\nThe respondent filed a motion for summary judgment dated July 9, 2003, in Civil Court, Queens County, on behalf of V.S.

By decision and order dated August 16, 2004, the Civil Court denied the motion, finding that, at a hearing held on July 13, 2004, the respondent “admitted that the instant motion served upon the court differed from the motion served upon the defendant.

As such the court may not consider the purported affidavit and as such, [the plaintiff] cannot make its prima facie showing.” The Civil Court further stated that the respondent “annexes the purported affidavit of Oleg Barshay, D.C., which the court cannot consider. The court finds that the papers filed with the court include an affidavit sworn to on June 14, 2004, while [the respondent’s] affirmation of service avers that service of the within Notice of Motion & Motion for Summary Judgment & Exhibits were served February 3, 2004. Finally, the court is losing patience with [the respondent], who appears to be oblivious to the procedures set forth in the CPLR with respect to filing with the court the same papers one serves upon the opposing side, as he continues to submit motions before the annexed affidavits are even executed and notarized.”\\nThe respondent filed a cross motion for summary judgment dated June 29, 2004, in Civil Court, Queens County, on behalf of IVB Medical Inc., in an action entitled TVB Med. Supply, Inc., as Assignee of Harold Soto v State Farm Mut. Ins. Co. (index No. 038430/04), wherein the plaintiff, a health services provider, sought reimbursement through New York State’s No-Fault Insurance Law. By decision and order dated March 28, 2005, the Civil Court denied the cross motion, finding that the NF-3 claim form served upon defense counsel was not signed. Yet, “[mysteriously,] the claims forms annexed to the plaintiffs papers [filed with the court] have a signature of ‘Berlovich.’ The court has previously admonished [the respondent] for the ‘bait and switch’ tactics used when submitting papers to the court.”\\nThe respondent filed a motion for summary judgment dated January 26, 2004, in Civil Court, Queens County, on behalf of PDG Psychological, P.C., in an action entitled PDG Psychological, P.C., as Assignee of Patricia Sandino v GEICO Ins.

By decision and order dated May 13, 2005, the Civil Court denied the motion, finding, inter alia, “in the matter at bar, it is apparent upon the court’s examination of the motion papers and as corroborated upon the sanctions hearing . . . that the supporting affidavit of Phil Goldstein, M.D., filed with the court and signed and notarized on June 20, 2004, is clearly not the same supporting affidavit contained [in the copy of the motion served upon defense counsel] which, according to the affirmation of service of [the respondent], were served upon [the defendant] on February 3, 2004 — four months before. The allegation of counsel contained in his affirmation as to service of [the plaintiffs] motion papers, purportedly including the supporting affidavit contained therein, is an impossibility. Moreover, the defendant is prejudiced by the very fact of defense counsel’s unawareness, on the return date, of the substance of the actual moving papers submitted to the court for its consideration.”\\nThe respondent filed a motion for summary judgment dated April 26, 2004, in Civil Court, Queens County, on behalf of PDG Psychological, P.C., in an action entitled PDG Psychological, P.C., as Assignee of Joseph Donna v Travelers Ins. Co. (index No. 100063/03), wherein the plaintiff, a health services provider, sought reimbursement through New York State’s No-Fault Insurance Law. By decision and order dated May 16, 2005, the Civil Court denied the motion, finding, inter alia, that it is “apparent upon the court’s examination of the motion papers and as corroborated upon the sanctions hearing . . . that the NF-3 claim form contained in the motion papers submitted to the court appears to have been altered. It appears that the handwritten name of the plaintiff health provider has been added above the printed name ‘Philip D. Goldstein’ in the space allotted for the provider’s signature, with the handwritten word ‘by’ also added to the immediate left thereof. Therefore, as it cannot be established that [the] plaintiff has submitted a copy of the actual NF-3 claim form allegedly submitted to [the defendant], [the] plaintiff cannot establish its submission to [the] defendant of its proof of claim.”\\nThe respondent filed a motion for summary judgment dated March 12, 2004, in Civil Court, Queens County, on behalf of Omni Chiropractic, P.C., in an action entitled Omni Chiropractic, P.C., as Assignee of Victor Ramos v New York Cent. Mut. Fire Ins. Co. (index No. 139599/03), wherein the plaintiff, a health services provider, sought reimbursement through New York State’s No-Fault Insurance Law. By decision and order dated May 16, 2005, the Civil Court denied the motion, finding, inter alia, “as disclosed upon the sanctions hearing . . . the moving papers filed with the court differed from that which were served upon [the] defendant. In view of such defect, the allegation in the affirmation as to service of [the respondent] that the within motion papers were served upon the defendant [is] patently erroneous and, at best, mistaken. The defendant is prejudiced by the very fact of its unawareness, on the return date, of the substance of the actual moving papers submitted to the Court for its consideration.”\\nThe respondent filed a motion for summary judgment dated March 12, 2004, in Civil Court, Queens County, on behalf of PDG Psychological, P.C., in an action entitled PDG Psychological, P.C., as Assignee of Dawn Miller v General Assur. Co. (index No. 032304/04), wherein the plaintiff, a health services provider, sought reimbursement through New York State’s No-Fault Insurance Law. By decision and order dated June 17, 2005, the Civil Court denied the motion, finding, inter alia, that the dis crepancy in the dates of the affidavit of Phil Goldstein submitted in support of the motion (March 22, 2004), and [the respondent’s] affirmation in support of the motion (March 12, 2004), “raises doubt that the copy of the document submitted is that of the actual supporting affidavit itself, as required by CPLR 2214, and also leaves open to speculation the propriety of [the] plaintiff’s motion papers as a whole. Additionally, the purported NF-3 proof of claim allegedly submitted to [the] defendant appears to have been altered as the wording ‘PDG Psychological, PC. By’ was clearly added after the issuance of the original NF-3.”\\nThe respondent filed a motion for summary judgment dated March 12, 2004, in Civil Court, Queens County, on behalf of Contemporary Acupuncture, P.C., in an action entitled Contemporary Acupuncture, P.C., as Assignee of Victor Ramos, Also Known as Victor Robles v New York Cent. Mut. Fire Ins. Co. (index No. 139595/03), wherein the plaintiff, a health services provider, sought reimbursement through New York State’s No-Fault Insurance Law. By decision and order dated June 17, 2005, the Civil Court denied the motion, finding, inter alia, “[i]n the matter at bar, it is apparent, as corroborated upon the sanctions hearing . . . that the one page supporting affidavit of Arkady Kiner, filed with the court and signed and notarized on March 12, 2004, is clearly not the same supporting affidavit as the undated two page supporting affidavit that was served upon [the defendant]. The allegation of [the respondent] contained in his affirmation as to service of [the] plaintiffs motion papers, purportedly including the supporting affidavit contained therein, is therefore erroneous. Moreover, the defendant is prejudiced by the very fact of defense counsel’s unawareness, on the return date, of the substance of the actual moving papers submitted to the court for its consideration.”\\nThe respondent filed a motion for summary judgment dated March 11, 2004, in Civil Court, Queens County, on behalf of PDG Psychological, PC., in an action entitled PDG Psychological, P.C., as Assignee of Melissa Charon v Progressive Cas. Ins. Co. (index No. 128621/03), wherein the plaintiff, a health services provider, sought reimbursement through New York State’s No-Fault Insurance Law. By decision and order dated June 17, 2005, the Civil Court denied the motion, finding, inter alia, “[i]n the matter at bar, it is apparent, as corroborated upon the sanctions hearing . . . that the one page supporting affidavit of Phil Goldstein, Ph.D., filed with the court and signed and notarized on March 11, 2004, is clearly not the same supporting affidavit as the undated and [un-notarized] two page supporting affidavit, which was served upon [the] defendant.

(index No. 38441/04), wherein the plaintiff, a health services provider, sought reimbursement through New York State’s No-Fault Insurance Law. By decision and order dated June 20, 2005, the Civil Court denied the cross motion, finding, inter alia, “as corroborated upon the sanctions hearing . . . the document submitted to the Court as the NF-3 in this action is not the NF-3 which was received by [the] defendant on June 2, 2003 — the May 28, 2003 NF-3 received by the defendant, as opposed to the purported NF-3 submitted to the court, being unsigned, billing the amount of $671 (rather than $675.50) and listing the items allegedly provided in a different order.”\\nThe respondent filed a motion for summary judgment dated January 26, 2004, in Civil Court, Queens County, on behalf of Oleg Barshay, D.C., P.C., in an action entitled Oleg Barshay, D.C., P.C., as Assignee of Garcelle Louis v State Farm Mut.

By decision and order dated June 24, 2005, the Civil Court denied the motion, finding, inter alia, that the discrepancy between the dates of the affidavit of Paul Mostun submitted in support of the motion (March 22, 2004), and the respondent’s affirmation in support of the motion (March 12, 2004), “raises doubt that the copy of the document submitted is that of the actual supporting affidavit itself, as required by CPLR 2214, and also leaves open to speculation the propriety of [the] plaintiffs motion papers as a whole . . . Additionally, even more egregious is the fact, apparent upon the court’s examination of the motion papers and as corroborated upon the sanctions hearing . . . that each of the two NF-3 claims allegedly submitted to the defendant appears to have been altered as, in each, the wording ‘GPM Chiropractic, PC. By’ was clearly added above the space allotted for the provider’s signature after the issuance of the original NF-3s.”\\nThe respondent filed a motion for summary judgment dated March 12, 2004, in Civil Court, Queens County, on behalf of GPM Chiropractic, P.C, in an action entitled GPM Chiropractic, P.C., as Assignee of Mary Mojica v General Assur.

By decision and order dated June 24, 2005, the Civil Court denied the motion, finding, inter alia, that the discrepancy between the dates of the affidavit of Paul Mostun submitted in support of the motion (March 22, 2004), and the respondent’s affirmation in support of the motion (March 12, 2004), “raises doubt that the copy of the document submitted is that of the actual supporting affidavit itself, as required by CPLR 2214, and also leaves open to speculation the propriety of the plaintiff’s motion papers as a whole . . . even more egregious is the fact, apparent upon the court’s examination of the motion papers and as corroborated upon the sanctions hearing . . . that each of the two NF-3 claims allegedly submitted to the defendant appears to have been altered as, in each, the wording ‘GPM Chiropractic, EC. By Pavel Mostun’ was clearly added above the space allotted for the provider’s signature after the issuance of the original NF-3’s.”\\nBy decision dated June 23, 2005, the Civil Court sanctioned the respondent for his conduct related to the foregoing actions (see PDG Psychological, P.C. v State Farm Ins. Co., 9 Misc 3d 172 [2005]). The Civil Court found that in six matters (PDG Psychological, P.C., as Assignee of Ekaterina Tchkadova v State Farm Mut. Ins. Co. [index No. 100072/03]; Oleg Barshay, D.C., P.C., as Assignee of Dorelus Bradford v State Farm Mut. Ins. Co. [index No. 47044/02]; Dilon Med. Supply Corp., as Assignee of Gaston Dandrade v General Cas. Co. of Wisconsin [index No. 133324/03]; Dilon Med. Supply Co., as Assignee of Dale Logan v American Ind. Co. [index No. 128714/03]; Oleg Barshay, D.C. P.C., as Assignee of Garcelle Louis v State Farm Mut. Ins. Co. [index No. 47045/02]; PDG Psychological, P.C., as Assignee of Patricia Sandino v GEICO Ins. Co. [index No. 139065/03]) the respondent “removed the earlier executed affidavit (which was served upon his adversary) from the original motion papers to be filed with the court and replaced same with a one-page affidavit, substantially different in its language and dated well after the affirmation of service. No proof of service of these replacement affidavits was filed with the court” (PDG Psychological, P.C. v State Farm Ins. Co., 9 Misc 3d at 174).\\nThe Civil Court further found that, in Delta Diagnostic Radiology, P.C., as Assignee of Jefferson Zelon v Progressive Ins. Co. (index No. 38710/04), the motion served upon defense counsel contained a two-page supporting affidavit dated March 22, 2004, while the motion filed with the court contained a one-page supporting affidavit dated March 12, 2004, “with substantially different contents” (PDG Psychological, P.C. v State Farm Ins. Co., 9 Misc 3d at 174).\\nThe Civil Court further found that, in Omni Chiropractic, P.C., as Assignee of Ramos Victor v New York Cent. Mut. Fire Ins. Co. (index No. 139599/03), the respondent served motion papers upon defense counsel “including a two-page affidavit of Bryan Siegel notarized the same day as the purported service, but the affidavit filed with the court was from an entirely different individual and provider executed after the purported service upon [the] defendant” (PDG Psychological, P.C. v State Farm Ins. Co., 9 Misc 3d at 174).\\nThe Civil Court further found that, in two cases (Contemporary Acupuncture, P.C., as Assignee of Victor Ramos, Also Known as Victor Robles v New York Cent. Mut. Fire Ins. Co. [index No. 139595/03] and PDG Psychological, P.C., as Assignee of Melissa Charon v Progressive Cas. Ins. Co. [index No. 128621/03]), the supporting “affidavits served upon the adversary were undated and on two pages, and yet the papers filed with the court contained a single page, dated affidavit” (PDG Psychological, P.C. v State Farm Ins. Co., 9 Misc 3d at 174-175). The Civil Court further found that, “[significantly, none of the defendants were aware of the bait and switch until either the conference held ... on the return date of the motion or upon the instant [sanctions] hearing” (id. at 175).\\nThe Civil Court further found that, in four cases (PDG Psychological, P.C., as Assignee of Joseph Donna v Travelers Ins. Co. [index No. 100063/03] [claim form “altered by additional handwriting placing the words ‘PDG Psychological, P.C.’ over the signature line and the word ‘by’ next to the ‘signature of E Goldstein’ ”]; PDG Psychological, P.C., as As-\\nsignee of Dawn Miller v General Assur. Co. [index No. 032304/04]; IVB Med. Supply, Inc., as Assignee of Harold Soto v State Farm Mut. Ins. Co. [index No. 038430/04] [the name “ ‘Berlovich’ was inserted on signature line of claim form filed with the court but not on the claim form submitted to the carrier or served upon the carrier’s attorney”]; and GPM Chiropractic, P.C., as Assignee of Mary Mojica v General Assur. Co. [index No. 128588/ 03] [claim form was “altered by inserting ‘GPM Chiropractic, P.C.’ and ‘by Parvel (sic) Moston’ (sic)”]), the respondent “knowingly submitted altered documents to the court, such documents being the very bases of the lawsuits commenced herein. A proper proof of claim is mandated as a building block of a provider’s prima facie case seeking reimbursement under New York State’s No-Fault Insurance Law. Consequently, the courts require a copy of the proof of claims as documentary proof. Apparently to avoid denial of its summary judgment motion[s], the claim forms were altered after service of motion papers upon its adversary (the served papers were not so changed), and, it follows logically, after the initial submission of the claim to the insurance carrier. Each claim form (NF-3) was altered by either adding a ‘signature’ or the corporate name with the word ‘by’ next to the provider’s signature, apparently to signal legal authority” (PDG Psychological, P.C. v State Farm Ins. Co., 9 Misc 3d at 175 [citations omitted]).\\nThe Civil Court further found that in the case of PDG Psychological, P.C., as Assignee of Melissa Charon v Progressive Cas. Ins. Co. (index No. 128621/03), the motion served upon defense counsel contained a two-page undated supporting affidavit and a duplicate of the claim form, while the motion filed with the court contained “substantially different papers including a one-page affidavit, dated and signed, and an altered claim[ ] form” (PDG Psychological, P.C. v State Farm Ins. Co., 9 Misc 3d at 176).\\nThe Civil Court further found that the respondent executed “false ‘certifications’ and false affirmations of service . . . Moreover, the documents were misleading and improper material was submitted knowingly by [the respondent]. The court and [the] plaintiffs’ adversaries were both initially deceived and, through such deception, [the respondent] violated the [Court Rules] as well as the CPLR and sought to affect the decision making process of the court. Although the court has not addressed the merits of many of the underlying motions, it simply cannot get beyond the false and perhaps perjurious filings. [The respondent] has provided no good faith reason for falsifying documents or for submitting documents to the court never served upon his adversaries. The only conclusion the court can conjure is that [the respondent] purposely sought to deceive his adversaries and improperly influence the court’s decision” (id. at 177).\\nThe Civil Court imposed sanctions against the respondent for his misconduct in the sum of $34,000 (id. at 178).\\nBased upon the foregoing, charge one alleges that the respondent engaged in a pattern and practice of conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of Code of Professional Responsibility DR 1-102 (a) (5) (22 NYCRR 1200.3 [a] [5]).\\nBased upon the foregoing, charge two alleges that the respondent engaged in a pattern of conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation, in violation of Code of Professional Responsibility DR 1-102 (a) (4) (22 NYCRR 1200.3 [a] [4]).\\nBased upon the evidence adduced, the Special Referee properly sustained charges one and two. Accordingly, the petitioner’s motion to confirm the Special Referee’s report is granted.\\nIn determining an appropriate measure of discipline to impose, we note that the respondent demonstrates no remorse and persists in blaming others for what he describes as harmless clerical errors. However, the sheer volume of documents at issue suggests otherwise and dispels the respondent’s arguments that he is innocent of conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice and/or conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation. His conduct goes to the very core of the judicial system.\\nUnder the totality of the circumstances, the respondent is disbarred and his name is stricken from the roll of attorneys and counselors-at-law.\\nMastro, A.EJ., Rivera, Skelos, Dillon and Leventhal, JJ., concur.\\nOrdered that the petitioner’s motion to confirm the Special Referee’s report is granted; and it is further,\\nOrdered that pursuant to Judiciary Law § 90, the respondent, Alden Banniettis, is disbarred, effective June 29, 2012, and his name is stricken from the roll of attorneys and counselors-at-law; and it is further,\\nOrdered that the respondent, Alden Banniettis, shall comply with this Court’s rules governing the conduct of disbarred, suspended, and resigned attorneys (see 22 NYCRR 691.10); and it is further,\\nOrdered that pursuant to Judiciary Law § 90, the respondent, Alden Banniettis, is commanded to desist and refrain from (1) practicing law in any form, either as principal or agent, clerk, or employee of another, (2) appearing as an attorney or counselor-at-law before any court, judge, justice, board, commission, or other public authority, (3) giving to another an opinion as to the law or its application or any advice in relation thereto, and (4) holding himself out in any way as an attorney and counselor-at-law; and it is further,\\nOrdered that if the respondent, Alden Banniettis, has been issued a secure pass by the Office of Court Administration, it shall be returned forthwith to the issuing agency and the respondent shall certify to the same in his affidavit of compliance pursuant to 22 NYCRR 691.10 (f).',\n",

       "       'text': 'The following opinion was filed January 28, 1913:\\nPer Curiam.\\nIn December, 1911, this action of garnishment was commenced in the civil court of Milwaukee county by the issuance of a summons in garnishment in aid of an execution. Judgment against the garnishees having been rendered in that court, Nahmens, the execution debtor, attempted to appeal to the circuit court, but did not serve his notice of appeal on the judge of the civil court who tried the case. Both parties appeared generally in the circuit court and, on motion of the respondent, the judgment of the civil court was affirmed, whereupon Nahmens appealed to this court. The case being regularly on the calendar and reached for argument in this court, the appellant (being in default as to the service of ease and brief under the rules) moved to strike the case from the calendar on the ground that this court had no jurisdiction of the action, because of the fact that the appeal to the circuit court was not properly perfected.\\nAfter consideration of the motion the court deems that it should not be granted. It is true that the appeal to the circuit court was not properly taken and the circuit court obtained no jurisdiction of the case thereby. Fred Miller B. Co. v. Milwaukee, 150 Wis. 336, 136 N. W. 157. Whether the circuit court subsequently acquired jurisdiction by the general appearance of the parties without objection in that court, we do not decide. Even if no jurisdiction was ae-, quired by the circuit court, it does not, follow that the appeal - to this court must be dismissed or stricken from the calendar. In such a case this court acquires jurisdiction of the case sufficiently to reverse the judgment because of tbe lack of jurisdiction below. Sucb was the course in the Miller Case, and such is the established doctrine of this court. Kidder v. Fay, 60 Wis. 218, 18 N. W. 839.\\nIn the affidavits filed there is considerable support for the idea that the appellant resorted to this expedient in order to-save himself from an affirmance of the judgment under’ the rule because of his default in serving his case and brief. This court is not disposed to allow injustice to be done in this way if it be possible to avoid it. The motion to strike from the calendar will be denied with $10 costs to be paid within ten days. Upon the payment of $25 to the respondent’s attorney, the appellant will be permitted to serve his-case and brief within ten days from this date, the respondent’s brief to be served within twenty days from this date;: and the case will then be placed on the March assignment for argument. In the event that the appellant fails to serve his-case and brief as allowed in this order, the judgment below will be affirmed upon the filing of proof of that fact by affidavit.\\nIt is so ordered.\\nThe following opinion was filed April 29, 1911:\\nSiebecker, J.\\nThis is an appeal by the defendant in the-original action from a judgment of the circuit court for Milwaukee county affirming a judgment of the civil court of Milwaukee county in the garnishment proceedings.\\nOn December 6, 1911, garnishment proceedings in aid of execution for-the collection of a judgment against the defendant in the principal action, Paul M. Nahmens, were commenced in the civil court of Milwaukee county against the C. E. Gether Company, a corporation, and O. E. Gether individually, as garnishees, by the issuance of a summons on the affidavit of Michael Levin, an attorney for B. F. Baltzstein, the assignee of the judgment of the Carl Worst Advertising Service, plaintiff in the principal action.\\nOn December 17th, the return day of the summons in the garnishment proceedings in the civil court, that court awarded judgment against the garnishees. The garnishee defendants by their attorney moved for a stay of proceedings, which was granted.\\nOn December 19th the defendant in the original action attempted to appeal from the judgment in the garnishment proceedings to the circuit court for Milwaukee county by serving a notice of appeal and affidavit of good faith on the clerk of the civil court. This notice of appeal and affidavit were not served on the judge of the civil court wherein the judgment against the garnishees was awarded and from which court the records in the garnishment proceedings were returned by the clerk of the civil court to the circuit court for Milwaukee county.\\nUpon motion in the circuit court that court affirmed the judgment of the civil court and directed that judgment be entered in the action in the circuit court against the garnishees and against the surety on the appeal bond. The defendant in the original action appealed to this court from the judgment of the circuit court in the garnishment proceedings.\\nAs declared in the case of Fred Miller B. Co. v. Milwaukee, 150 Wis. 336, 136 N. W. 157, the notice of appeal and the affidavit of good faith required for taking an appeal from the civil court of Milwaukee county to the circuit court for such county must be served on the judge of the civil court. This is required under the provisions of ch. 549, Laws of 1909, and to which reference is made in the opinion of the above cited case. As there indicated, under the state of the record before us in this case, showing that the notice of appeal and affidavit of good faith were not served on the judge of the civil court, it must be- held that no appeal from the civil court was taken in this action and that the circuit court was without jurisdiction to make the order and award the judgment appealed from. The proceeding in the circuit court in this case did not cure the jurisdictional defect, as was held to be the result in the case of Manufacturers & M. I. Bureau v. Everwear H. Co. 152 Wis. 73, 138 N. W. 624, where no motion to dismiss or objection to the jurisdiction was made and the parties appeared in the circuit court and tried the case de novo.\\nBy the Court. — The judgment appealed from is reversed.',\n",

Upon the evidence in this case the question whether any injury to plaintiff’s health was proximately caused hy negligence of the attendants in the defendant hospital, or whether the injuries complained of are attributable to ailments with which plaintiff had been afflicted a long time before she entered the hospital as a patient, is field to have been one for the jury.\\n2. An appeal from an order of the circuit court reversing a judgment of the Milwaukee civil court and granting a new trial in the circuit court does not bring before the supreme court for review a previous order of the circuit court denying a motion to dismiss the appeal from the civil court to the circuit court.\\n3. In an action against a physician and a hospital for injury to the health of a patient, where the jury found that plaintiff was injured by the treatment given her by each defendant and that negligence of each' defendant was a proximate cause of the injury, and assessed her damages, but after verdict the trial court correctly held that the physician was not negligent, a new trial was necessary, it being manifest that a part of the damages awarded were for the injury which the jury found was produced by the physician’s treatment.\\nAppKal from an order of tbe circuit court for Milwaukee county: E. T. Eaieciiild, Circuit Judge.\\nAffirmed.\\nTbe appeal is from an order reversing a judgment of tbe civil court of Milwaukee county in favor of tbe plaintiff in tbe sum of $1,500, and granting a new trial in tbe circuit court.\\nTbe plaintiff brought action to recover damages from Dr. Albin A. Krygier and tbe defendant hospital for injuries to her health alleged to have been cáused by negligence in care of her while she was a patient at tbe institution.\\nHer complaint alleges, in substance, that on and prior to the 12th day of March, 1916, the plaintiff, a married woman in pregnant condition, consulted the defendant Albin A. Krygier as to a suitable hospital to go to for confinement; that Dr. Krygier advised going to the Good Samaritan Hospital; that the plaintiff was a patient at that institution for a number of days, during which time she was mistreated both by reason of the physician’s failure to leave instruction as to a proper diet and to care for her and also by reason of neglect on the part of the hospital attendants to care for her and her child, causing permanent injury to the health of the plaintiff. More particularly the complaint alleges: That on arriving at the hospital the patient was, against her wishes, placed in a public ward; that later she was moved to a private room which was unheated; that insufficient bed clothes were provided by the hospital so that she became chilled; that the nurses allowed her on several occasions to remain for hours in cold, water-soaked bedding in spite of her requests that they change the bed clothes; that while irrigating her they left the windows of the room open, exposing her person to chill winds; that on the second day after the birth of her child she was improperly fed; that the nurses persisted in harassing and annoying her by refusing to bring her child to her; that the child was kept a great portion of the time in a bathroom which diseased persons were accustomed to use and where the pans of the hospital were emptied; that this resulted in a heavy cold to the patient, from which she has never recovered, and caused her great nervous suffering.\\nThe answer of Dr. Krygier denied that at any time he was guilty of misfeasance or malfeasance or that he had any knowledge of any mistreatment on the part- of the hospital such as plaintiff’s complaint alleges. He further denied that either patient or her child received any infection or injuries while at the hospital.\\nThe answer of the defendant Good Samaritan Hospital also denied all charges of negligence or malfeasance.\\nTbe case was tried before tbe court and a jury. A special verdict was returned in wbicb tbe jury found that tbe plaintiff sustained injury in consequence of tbe treatment given her at the hospital; that tbe hospital was guilty of negligence in tbe course of its treatment; that this negligence was a proximate cause of the patient’s injury; that tbe plaintiff sustained injury in consequence of tbe treatment given her by Dr. Krygier; that be was guilty of negligence, and that such negligence was a proximate cause of tbe plaintiff’s injury; that no want of ordinary care on plaintiff’s part was a proximate contribution to her injury; and assessed the plaintiff’s damages in tbe sum of $1,500.\\nTbe plaintiff moved for judgment on tbe verdict. Tbe defendant moved for a judgment for tbe Good Samaritan Hospital upon tbe merits, notwithstanding tbe verdict, and asking, in event that the court denied tbe motion, that answers to certain questions be changed by tbe court; that in event these motions be denied tbe special verdict be set aside and a new trial granted.\\nTbe court changed tbe jury’s answer finding Dr. Krygier guilty of negligence and that this negligence was a proximate cause of plaintiff’s injuries, and dismissed plaintiff’s complaint as against Dr. Krygier, and denied tbe motions of tbe defendant Good Samaritan Hospital. Judgment was entered accordingly, Dr. Krygier recovering bis costs from tbe plaintiff.\\nTbe defendant appealed to tbe circuit court for Milwaukee county. Motion by tbe plaintiff to dismiss tbe appeal was denied. Upon the motion of tbe defendant Good Samaritan Hospital to set aside tbe judgment of tbe civil court and award judgment to dismiss tbe complaint upon tbe record and tbe files, tbe circuit court entered an order reversing tbe judgment of tbe civil court' on tbe ground of prejudicial error and granting a new trial in tbe circuit court. Appeal is taken from this order.\\nFor tbe appellant there was a brief by Raymond J. Gannon, and oral argument by Mr. Gannon and Mr. W. L. Gold, both of Milwaukee.\\nEor tbe respondent there was a brief by Robert R. Freeman, attorney, and Henry J. Bendinger, of counsel, both of Milwaukee, and oral argument by Mr. Bendinger.\",\n",

       "       'text': 'SiebeckbR, J.\\nTbe defendant Good Samaritan Hospital, upon tbe return made by tbe civil court on appeal to tbe circuit court, moved to vacate tbe judgment awarding plaintiff recovery of tbe damages found by tbe jury in tbe civil court and that judgment be directed upon tbe record dismissing plaintiff’s complaint. It is claimed that tbe plaintiff is not entitled to recover in this case for tbe reason that any negligence on tbe part of tbe hospital agents and servants is not shown to be tbe proximate cause of tbe injuries complained of by tbe plaintiff. This claim is based on tbe contentions (1) that tbe evidence fails to show that tbe plaintiff is afflicted with tuberculosis; (2) that tbe evidence discloses that tbe injuries complained of are attributable to ailments with which tbe plaintiff bad been afflicted a long time prior to tbe time she entered defendant’s hospital. Tbe evidence bearing on tbe question of plaintiff’s being afflicted with tuberculosis is very meager and indefinite and may be different on a retrial of tbe case. We deem it proper that this phase of tbe controversy be left for determination upon tbe evidence as it may appear upon a retrial of this issue.\\nIt is contended that- it is without dispute that tbe plaintiff bad a goiter before Dr. Krygier treatefl her prior to her entrance into tbe hospital, and that bis evidence shows that this affliction is tbe exciting cause of plaintiff’s alleged nervousness, and hence it necessarily was a mere conjecture of tbe jury to find that tbe nervousness complained of resulted from tbe treatment she received at tbe hospital.\\nWe cannot say upon tbe evidence presented, as a matter of law, that the goiter affliction is the exciting canse of the nervousness plaintiff claims resulted from the alleged mistreatment charged in the complaint, nor is the contention of the defendant, that there is no credible evidence in the case tending to show that the alleged negligence of the hospital attendants is the proximate cause of any injury to plaintiff’s health, sustained by the record. This was a proper inquiry for the jury to determine, and the trial court’s ruling on this point must stand. The claim that the damages are excessive cannot properly be determined upon this appeal in view of the fact that a new trial of the case must be had.\\nThe plaintiff insists that the circuit court erred in denying her motion to dismiss defendant’s appeal of the case from civil court to the circuit court. It appears that judgment was entered in the civil court March 12, 1911, and that the defendant on March Í6th served the required notice, affidavit, and undertaking for an appeal from this judgment to the circuit court, and filed the same in the civil court on March 19th, and that the return of the civil court pursuant to such appeal proceeding was made May 18th, showing that the clerk’s fees were paid on that day. On May 25th the circuit court, upon plaintiff’s application, made an order requiring the defendant to show cause before the court on June 2d why the appeal to the circuit court should not be dismissed for failure to pay the clerk’s fees in the civil court within twenty days after service of the notice of appeal of the case to the circuit court as required by the provisions of ch. 320, Laws 1913.\\nThis motion was heard in the circuit court upon affidavits and an order was made July 19, 1917, denying the motion to dismiss the appeal. On October 15, 1917, the circuit court entered an order upon defendant’s motion reversing the judgment of the civil court awarding plaintiff recovery of damages and costs and directing that the action should be tried before a jury as if originally brought in the circuit court, upon the ground that the defendant had not had a fair trial in the civil court and .that substantial justice cannot be done and the rights of tbe parties cannot otherwise he preserved or protected. The plaintiff took this appeal from the order reversing the civil court’s judgment and granting a new trial of the action in the circuit court.\\nThis appeal is necessarily restricted to a review of this order and cannot embrace any other order by the circuit court in a separate proceeding, such as the motion for dismissal of the appeal above referred to. Nor can this court, upon the return of the civil court record, entertain the suggestion that the circuit court thereby acquired no jurisdiction of the case, since there was a separate and independent proceeding in circuit court to have the appeal from the civil court dismissed, which is supplementary to the return of the civil court on the question involved in such motion.\\nIt is considered that the order of the circuit court refusing to dismiss the defendant’s appeal from the judgment of the civil court is not before this court upon the appeal from the order of the circuit court reversing such judgment and granting a new trial in the action.\\nIt is further contended by the plaintiff that the circuit court erred in granting a new trial, since the • complaint against Dr. Krygier was dismissed for the reason that the evidence shows he was not guilty of any negligence contributing to the injuries plaintiff complains of. By the fourth question of the special verdict the jury found that Dr. Kry-gier’s treatment of plaintiff was injurious and that such treatment proximately contributed to cause the injury.\\nThe civil court after verdict correctly held that the doctor was not negligent in his treatment. It is manifest that the jury awarded her some damages for the injury they found the doctor’s treatment produced. The circuit court held that this state of the case required that a new trial be granted in order that substantial justice be done and the rights of the parties be preserved and protected. We are of the opinion that this ruling was just and proper.\\nBy the Oourt.- — -The order appealed from is affirmed.',\n",

       "       'text': 'Order, Supreme Court, New York County, entered May 18, 1979, denying plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction, is affirmed, without costs. Plaintiffs tenants seek a preliminary injunction (a) tolling and staying the effect of a so-called 10-day notice to cure, dated January 10, 1979, and (b) enjoining the landlords from commencing summary proceedings in the Civil Court. In addition to serious disputed questions as to the ultimate rights of the parties, we think that the preliminary injunction was properly denied for these reasons: As to tolling the 10-day notice to cure, the alleged default is the occupancy by tenants of the premises for residential purposes. If this is indeed a default, there would be no practical way to cure this other than the tenants moving out. In the circumstances, there is no point to tolling the running of the 10-day period. If, on the other hand, the tenants are right and their occupancy is not a default, then there is nothing to cure. As to the branch of the injunction seeking to restrain the institution of holdover summary dispossess proceedings in the Civil Court, tenants can urge, at least in defense of those actions, their contentions by way of legal or equitable defenses. If for any reason it appears that the jurisdiction of the Civil Court will be inadequate to give the parties full relief, the parties can move to consolidate the Civil Court action with the present action in the Supreme Court for a declaratory judgment. (Cf. Barak v 28 E. 6262 Realty Corp., 70 AD2d 543.) We should not at this stage preclude landlords from choosing whatever forum they wish in which to bring their suit in the first instance. We note that on the oral argument defendants’ attorney conceded in personam jurisdiction over defendant Eliahu Lipkis. Concur—Murphy, P.

       "       'text': 'Fein, J. (dissenting).\\nAppellants, tenants of loft premises at 71-33 Franklin Street, are parties to summary proceedings for eviction in Civil Court. All but one of the appellants had two-year leases dating as far back as 1975. Each alleges that at the time of moving in, substantial outlays of cash were made on the understanding that the premises would be used for residential purposes. The landlord assured them that descriptions of the premises in the leases as \"artist studio” and \"creating and doing business in art” were just formalities. Some of the appellants describe their premises at that time as already designed or constructed for living, with full residential bathroom, kitchen, washer and dryer. For these quarters a substantial fixture fee had to be paid to the outgoing tenants, out of which the landlord extracted his own fee as \"key money.” Others substantially improved their premises after moving in, all assertedly with the knowledge and tacit approval of the landlord. Indeed, several of the appellants point to the landlord’s apparent pride in later showcasing these improved lofts to visitors. In each case .appellants allege that these substantial cash outlays for purchase of fixtures or improvements to the premises were undertaken in reliance on the landlord’s oral promise to extend or renew the lease for an additional term upon expiration, because occupancy for only two years would not have justified the sizable investments. One of the appellants never did receive a lease, and none was offered a renewal. Continuing as month-to-month tenants (some paying increased rent pursuant to what they considered to be the new rate under the originally promised renewal), all but one were served in December, 1978 with 30-day notices to terminate tenancy. Within two weeks, all the holdover tenants were additionally served with 10-day notices to cure by immediate cessation of residential occupancy. Following commencement of the summary proceedings in Civil Court, appellants and others brought the instant action in Supreme Court for declaratory relief to the effect that they were not in violation of their leases, and for specific performance of the agreements to renew the leases. Instead of serving complaints, appellants moved for a stay of the running of the notices to cure their alleged leasehold violations by reason of \"residential occupancy”, and for a preliminary injunction against the summary holdover proceedings in Civil Court pursuant to the 30-day termination notices, pending determination of the actions for specific performance. Appeal is from the order denying such relief. The majority characterizes the attempt to stay the notices to cure as meaningless because there would be nothing to cure if appellants are not in default by reason of the manner of their occupancy. But assuming appellants are correct, this is precisely why a stay of the running of these notices is required, to stave off a default which would merely be an additional ground for eviction. Allowing the cure period to run could be fatal to appellants’ future rights in litigation (First Nat. Stores v Yellowstone Shopping Center, 21 NY2d 630; 150 East 57th St. Assoc, v Fletcher, 35 AD2d 947). The leases can be read as intending residential occupancy. (Lipkis v Pikus, 72 AD2d 697, affirming on the majority opinion at Appellate Term). Any cure would require joint action by the landlord and the tenants, as Lipkis (supra) recognizes. Apparently the same landlord is there involved, and those premises are loft premises similarly occupied and altered under similar leases. A stay of the running of the 10-day cure notices is requisite. The majority would further deny a preliminary injunction against the holdover proceedings because the declaratory relief sought below is supposedly available to appellants in the Civil Court action. It is not disputed that the Civil Court is the proper forum for summary proceedings, but what is not clear is the authority of the Civil Court to entertain appellants’ request for the declaratory relief sought in the instant proceeding. While section 743 of the Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law does afford tenants in Civil Court the opportunity to interpose equitable defenses and counterclaims in summary proceedings, there is no authority for the equitable affirmative relief of specific performance that appellants seek here. The majority concludes that this bridge can be crossed when it is reached in the Civil Court proceedings by a motion to consolidate with the instant action in Supreme Court, but such is not always the case (see Lun Far Co. v Aylesbury Assoc., 40 AD2d 794). We have recently held that specific performance of an option to buy is not available to tenants in conjunction with a holdover proceeding in Civil Court (Barak v 28 E. 6262 Realty Corp., 70 AD2d 543). There the landlord’s proceeding for nonpayment of one month’s rent was commenced in Civil Court only after the tenants had brought suit in Supreme Court on an option to purchase. The tenants appealed denial of injunction against the summary proceeding, pendente lite, and consolidation of that proceeding in Supreme Court. We reversed to the extent of granting consolidation on the ground that disposition of the summary proceeding in Civil Court \"would not dispose of all issues” as to the tenants’ rights under their leases. We did not pass on the denial of injunctive relief only because not appealed from and because consolidation obviated the need for such relief. Plaintiffs here do not seek consolidation. They seek an injunction because the Civil Court has no jurisdiction to grant specific performance or a declaratory judgment. The fact that a future consolidation motion might be granted is hardly a ground for denying relief to which plaintiffs are entitled. We have held that a tenant is entitled to a stay of proceedings to terminate a lease pursuant to a notice to cure, pending resolution of the rights of the parties to the lease in a declaratory judgment action in the Supreme Court (Wuertz v Cowne, 65 AD2d 528). For the same reasons there should be a stay of the Civil Court actions here. I would reverse the order appealed from and grant the motion for a preliminary injunction pendente lite, conditioned upon appellants’ payment of the rent at the current rates.',\n",

However, I find inappropriate so much of the relief applied for as seeks to enjoin defendants from commencing summary holdover proceedings in the Civil Court under the 30-day notice to vacate. As the majority points out, should such proceedings be initiated the proper method for procuring a disposition of all of the issues now in controversy between the parties would be to effect a consolidation of any summary proceeding bottomed upon the 30-day notice with this action (cf. Barak v 28 E. 6262 Realty Corp., 70 AD2d 543). Accordingly, I would modify the order appealed from to grant a temporary injunction tolling and staying the effect of the 10-day notice and, except, as so modified, affirm.',\n",

In November, 1948, they commenced the present circuit court action, and alleged in their verified complaint that the first notice they had of the existence of the civil court judgment was when an order for proceedings supplementary to execution, under ch. 273, Stats., was served on them on October 4, 1948, and their attorney then informed them that the judgment had been entered against them pursuant to a cognovit judgment note signed by them. They immediately obtained an order to show cause in the civil court why the judgment docketed on September 30, 1947, should not be vacated and set aside, and why they should not be permitted to file an answer in said matter. After a hearing the civil court dismissed their order to show cause for want of jurisdiction of the court on the ground that, as the judgment was docketed on September 30, 1947, there had elapsed more than the one year within which the civil court is authorized to vacate a default judgment under certain provisions in sub. 1 of sec. 21, ch. 549, Laws of 1909, relating to procedure in the civil court, which authorizes the court to vacate default judg ments “within one year from the docketing of such judgment.” From that dismissal of their motion in the civil court Greinkes did not appeal to the circuit court.\\nInstead they commenced in the latter court their present action for equitable relief restraining enforcement of the civil court judgment. Upon Midland’s motion for summary judgment dismissing Greinkes’ complaint the circuit court granted judgment to that effect for the following reasons. Another provision in said sub. 1 of sec. 21, of the laws relating to procedure in the civil court provides that,—\\n“Said court, or the judges thereof, shall have the same power as the circuit court, or the judges thereof, to entertain motions, make orders, stay proceedings, vacate judgments, and to grant new trials and other relief.” (Ch. 37, Laws of 1939.)\\nThus there is expressly vested in the civil court and its judges the same power in respect to vacating judgments as is vested in the circuit court and its judges by sec. 269.46 (1), Stats., which provides:\\n“The court may, upon notice and just terms, at any time within one year after notice thereof, relieve a party from a judgment, order, stipulation or other proceeding against him obtained, through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect and may supply an omission in any proceeding.”\\nUnder those provisions the period within which relief may be granted by vacating a judgment is at any time within one year after notice thereof, instead of within one year from the docketing thereof. Consequently, if as Greinkes alleged, the first notice they had of the existence of said judgment against them was after the order for supplementary proceedings was served on them on October 4, 1948, then upon their showing to that effect the civil court had jurisdiction and power to grant relief by vacating said judgment at any time within the year after Greinkes had such notice; and the civil court’s denial of such relief on solely the ground that there was want of jurisdiction was an erroneous determination, which they would have been entitled to have reviewed and reversed if they had appealed therefrom to the circuit court. Consequently they had an adequate remedy at law, and there is applicable the rule that when an action at law furnishes complete and adequate relief, there is no occasion for resorting to equity. The «equitable action only lies when there is no adequate remedy at law. Royal Indemnity Co. v. Sangor, 166 Wis. 148, 152, 164 N. W. 821; Coon v. Seymour, 71 Wis. 340, 346, 37 N.

       "       'text': 'Leo Brown, J.\\nThis is a motion by the plaintiffs for an order removing and transferring the action from the Civil Court to this court \"upon the ground that said Civil Court does not have jurisdiction to grant the relief to which the plaintiffs are entitled”, and further granting leave to serve an amended bill of particulars on the ground that \"the damages sustained by plaintiffs are greater in amount than set forth in the original Bill of Particulars.”\\nThe sole basis on which the application is predicated is that the special damages set forth in the original bill of particulars although it alleged that plastic surgery would be required for the two plaintiffs denominated as infants, it did not set forth the estimated cost of the plastic surgery and attending hospitalization which \"were left for a supplemental Bill of Particulars.” It appears that one of these plaintiffs is no longer an infant and this may also be true of the other. Nowhere in the moving papers is there any request by these plaintiffs for an increase in the ad damnum clause. ;\\nThe action which is to recover for personal injuries sustained in a collision between two motor vehicles was originally commenced in this court and having been denied a general preference it was transferred to the Civil Court under CPLR 325 (subd [d]) by an order of this court dated October 23, 1974. An examination of the file indicates that the complaint demanded judgment in favor of the plaintiff Wendal Daniels in the amount of $15,000, in favor of the plaintiff Shelton Daniels in the amount of $25,000, and in favor of the mother for loss of services in the total amount of $10,000.\\nThe plaintiffs do not deny that numerous conferences on this action have been held in the Civil Court and that the trial has been adjourned on several occasions at the request of the attorney for the plaintiffs.\\nThe plaintiffs are in error in their contention that in these circumstances the Civil Court lacks jurisdiction to grant to plaintiffs the relief they seek.\\nCPLR 325 (subd [d]) provides that if the Appellate Division determines that calendar conditions in a lower court permit, it may by rule provide that a court in which the action is pending may, in its discretion, remove the action without consent to the lower court. The Appellate Division, Second Department, has made such a determination. Pursuant thereto, the following rule has been adopted for the Supreme Court, Queens County (22 NYCRR 795.14): \"The Appellate Division having determined that calendar conditions in the Civil Court of the City of New York, Queens County, will permit transfer of cases thereto, the Supreme Court may remove any action or proceeding pending in the Supreme Court to the Civil Court of the City of New York in accordance with the provisions of CPLR 325(d).” It was in accord anee with the foregoing rule that this action was transferred to the Civil Court.\\nCPLR 305 (subd [d]) continues as follows: \"If the action is so removed, then the verdict or judgment shall be subject to the limitation of monetary jurisdiction of the court in which the action was originally commenced and shall be lawful to the extent of the amount demanded within such limitation.”\\nInasmuch as the plaintiffs do not seek any increase in the demand for judgment, it follows that the Civil Court has jurisdiction to grant a verdict or judgment for the amounts demanded in the complaint in the action originally commenced in this court. There is, thus, no ground for retransfer of the case here. Accordingly, that branch of the motion is denied.\\nSince the case is being left in the Civil Court, that court is the proper forum in which to seek permission either to amend the bill of particulars in the manner sought or to serve a supplemental bill of particulars. This court is without jurisdiction to entertain such an application. That branch of the motion is, therefore, also denied, with leave, however, to the plaintiffs to make such application with respect to the bill of particulars in the Civil Court as they may deem advisable.',\n",

Nooney & Co., Inc., on September 21, 1931, instituted suit against the relator, W. B. Veal, in the Civil Court of Record for Duval County, Florida. On that day the Civil Court of Record issued a summons ad respondendum\\' directed to all and singular the sheriffs of the State of Florida. On September 22, 1931, the summons ad respondendum was placed in the hands of the Sheriff of Dade County, Florida, who, on the 24th day of September, 1931, duly served the same in Dade County, Florida, upon the defendant named therein, \"W. B. Veal. The return day in the summons was the first Monday in October, 1931. On or before the appearance day, said W. B. Veal, named in the summons as defendant, entered his special appearance in the Civil Court of Record for Duval County solely for the purpose of contesting the jurisdiction of said court over his person by reason of the service of the summons ad respondendum which .had been made upon him in Dade County, and not in Duval County. Thereafter in due course, the defendant moved to quash the service upon the ground that under Senate Bill 351, 1931 Session of the Legislature, which became Chapter 14664, Acts of 1931, a summons ad respondendum issued out of a Civil Court of Record was provided to run throughout the county only where such Civil Cofirt of Record is situated, and should be directed to the Sheriff of such county, and not to all and singular the sheriffs of the State of Florida, as was done in said ease. The respondent Judge of the Civil Court of Record of Duval County denied the motion to quash. This having been done, petitioner Veal applied to this Court for a rule msi in prohibition alleging that the Civil Court of Record of Duval County was about to take further proceedings in said cause against him without having acquired jurisdiction over his person through the sendee o\\'f a proper summons ad respondendum, or otherwise. Speight v. Horne, 101 Fla. 109, 133 Sou. Rep. 574, 577.\\nThis Court granted the rule nisi and the cause is now before the Court on the demurrer of the respondent Judge to the relator’s suggestion for a writ of prohibition absolute.\\nChapter 14664, Acts of 1931, reads as follows:\\n“AN ACT to Amend Section 9 of Chapter 11357, Acts of the Extraordinary Session of 1925, the Same Being Section 5164 of the Compiled General Laws of Florida, 1927, Relating to Rules of Procedure and Prescribing the Issuance, Service and Return of Process for Civil Courts of Record.\\nBE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA:\\nSection 1. That Section 9 of Chapter 11357, Acts of the Extraordinary Session of 1925, the same being Section 5164 of the Compiled General Laws of 1927, relating to rules of procedure, and prescribing the issuance, service and return of process for Civil Courts of Record be and the same is amended to read as follows :\\n‘5164. RULES OF PROCEDURE. Rules of pleading, practice, procedure and evidence, and the laws of this State prescribing rules of pleading, practice, procedure and evidence, and prescribing issuance, service and return of process for Circuit Courts, shall, so far as they are applicable, govern such Civil Courts of Record; provided, however, that in all civil causes summons ad respondendum and other process, when issued out of any Civil Court of Record of this State shall run throughout the county only where such Civil Court of Record is situated and shall be directed to the Sheriff of such County.’\\nSection 2. All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this are hereby repealed.\\nSection 3. This Act shall become a law upon its passage and approval by the Governor, or upon its becoming a law without his approval.\\nApproved June 2, 1931.”\\nBy reference to this Act, it will be noted that it undertakes specifically to amend Section 9 of Chapter 11357, Acts of the Extraordinary Session of 1925. The Section attempted to be thus amended appears as Section 5164 of the Compiled General Laws of Florida and refers to rules of procedure and prescribes the issuance, service and return of process for certain courts designated as Civil Courts of Record. Conceding, therefore, for the sake of argument, that the statute as drawn is constitutionally sufficient for its purpose, the respondent contends that by its own terms it is not applicable to the court functioning as the Civil Court of Record of Duval County, Florida, and if not so applicable, that the writ of prohibition should be denied by reason thereof. With that contention we shall presently deal.\\nSection 1 of Chapter 14664, Acts of 1931, Laws of Florida, purports by its title and terms to amend only Section 9 of Chapter 11357, Acts of 1925. Chapter 11357, Acts of 1925, created in a certain class of counties therein described certain Civil Courts of Record other than the Civil Court of Record of Duval County, which last mentioned Court was already in existence and functioning at the time under the provisions of Chapter 8521, Acts of 1921. Unless therefore by some legitimate rule of construction, the proviso in amended Section 9 of Chapter 11357, Acts of 1925, can be extended to process issued by the Civil Court of Record of Duval County, which exists under a separate, different and disconnected statute, Chapter 14664, supra, can have no effect upon process of any Civil Court of Record other than those Civil Courts of Record which were created and exist under Chapter 11357, as hereinbefore mentioned.\\nThe purpose of creation, history and legal status of the Civil Court of Record in and for Duval County is a matter of which this Court takes judicial notice. Indeed it is a matter concerning which the bar of Florida is generally familiar since it was first in Duval County that Civil Courts of Record had their initial conception, creation and existence. The original Civil Court of Record in that County was organized under Chapter 6904, Acts of 1915, which Chapter was re-enacted in the Revised General Statutes of 1920 as Sections 3310-3324, R. G. S.\\nPursuant to the 1915 statute, the Civil Court of Record in and for Duval County, with the Judge provided therefor by law, began to function. Afterward in 1921 the Legislature enacted Chapter 8521, Acts of 1921, by which another Court of the same name was created, with a continuance of substantially the same kind of jurisdiction and powers as the old. The subsequent organization and functioning of the present Civil Court of Record of Duval County as a separate and distinct Civil Court of Record from the other Civil Courts of Record of this State, has been consistently recognized for more than ten years last past, not only by this Court, but by the Legislature itself, which, in enacting Chapter 11357, Acts of 1925, Extraordinary Session, designedly brought into existence another class of Civil Courts of Record, giving to them the same title but conferring a broaded jurisdiction with correspondingly increased powers substantially different in terms and relative degree from that provided to be possessed and exercised by the Civil Court of Record of Duval County under Chapter 8521. For example, under Chapter 11357, supra, Civil Courts of Record are given jurisdiction in controversies involving amounts up to $5,000.00, while under Chapter 8521, the Courts there created are limited to $3,000.00. In counties where county courts have been abolished, it is provided that such Civil Courts of Record under Chapter 11357, shall have two judges. See Chapter 11970, Acts of 1927. Other distinctions of importance could be pointed out, but these are sufficient to demonstrate the difference in the character of the courts created by Chapter 11357, supra, despite their similarity in name to those created by Chapter 8521, supra.\\nThe Civil Court of Record of Duval County has never functioned nor exercised jurisdiction other than under Chapter 6904, Acts of 1915, Section 3310-3324, R. G-. S., and Chapter 8521, Acts of 1921. This fact has been noted and referred to in many opinions of this Court, whereof a few are hereinafter cited.\\nThe Supreme Court of Florida, both in directing and sustaining the Civil Court of Record in Duval County as to its jurisdiction, process and procedure, has invariably based its decisions on the particular laws herein-before referred to under which the Civil Court of Record of Duval County was brought into existence and continued to function, and in no instance, that we are aware of, has this Court referred to Chapter 11357, Acts of 1925, or any Act amendatory or supplementary thereto, as having any bearing on the status or powers of those Civil Courts of Record authorized and acting solely under Chapter 8521. Forest Investment Co. v. Aultman, 80 Fla. 790, 87 Sou. Rep. 43; American Ry. Exp. Co. v. Weatherford, 84 Fla. 264, 93 Sou. Rep. 740; State ex rel. Royal Ins. Co. v. Barrs, 87 Fla. 168, 99 Sou. Rep. 668; Barrs v. State ex rel. Jacksonville Realty & Mtge. Co., 91 Fla. 30, 107 Sou. Rep. 249; Atlantic Coast Line Ry. Co. v. Florida Fine Fruit Co., 93 Fla. 161, 112 Sou. Rep. 66; Barrs v. State ex rel. Britt, 95 Fla. 75, 116 Sou. Rep. 28.\\nThe original jurisdiction of the Civil Court of Record of Duval County under the Act of 1915 was confined to a maximum amount of $1500.00. This was increased in 1921 to $3,000.00, in all cases at law where: (a) the cause of action in whole or in part accrued in the county, or (b) the property involved in whole or in part was in the county, or (c) the defendant, or one of the defendants, was found in the county, and in all eases just enumerated, such Court was given exclusive original jurisdiction both by the statute and constitution.\\nCivil Courts o\\'f Record recognized under Chapter 8521, supra, are, within the amounts of their jurisdiction, placed by the Act creating them, upon the same footing as Circuit Courts, and in order that such Civil Courts of Record could properly perform the judicial functions assigned to them in the counties where they existed, it was deemed essential that the process of such courts should extend beyond the limits of the county wherein they were created, in like manner as the process of Circuit Courts runs from the Circuit Court issuing it, to all and singular the sheriffs of all the counties of the State of Florida, against defendants in other counties.\\nSuch purpose and intent was clearly indicated in original Sections 10 and 11 of Chapter 6904, Acts of 1915, which were re-enacted in R. G. S. 3319 and 3320, and again reproduced in exact terms as Sections 9 and 10 of the 1921 Act (Chapter 8521).\\nThe Sections referred to as appearing in the 1921 Act, supra, read as follows:\\n“Sec. 9. The rules of pleading, practice, proee dure and evidence, and the laws of this State prescribing rules of pleading, practice, procedure and evidence, and prescribing the services and return of process of Circuit Courts, shall, so far as they are applicable, govern in Civil Courts of Record.\\nSec. 10. All the provisions of the Revised General Statutes of Florida, and laws amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto, which can be applied to the Civil Courts of Record, or to any proceeding therein, or to any officer thereof, shall be applicable thereon in all cases except where they are inconsistent with the provisions of this Act.”\\nThese Sections of the Act of 1921 stand today unmodified by amendatory act, or otherwise, as will be seen from a careful examination of all the existing subsequent statutes. Chapter 11357, Acts of 1925, does not amend them because it contains an express provision to the effect that such latter Act “shall not apply” to any Civil Court of Record which had already been created under Chapters 6904 and 8521. This being so, it would seem to follow now that if the whole of Chapter 11357, Acts of 1925, as it stood unamended, did not apply to those other Civil Courts of Record which had been created and were in existence under Chapter 8521, Acts of 1921, that the amendment made by the 1931 Legislature to Section 9 of Chapter 11357, Acts of 1925, is likewise inapplicable to such Civil Courts of Record as were created, and which were empowered to function as independent courts, under the prior acts.\\nChapter 14664, Acts of 1931, by its very terms, is limited to nothing more than an attempt to amend Section 9 of Chapter 11357, Acts of 1925. Being so lixhited in its terms, it can be given no legal effect as an amendment to Sections 9 and 10 of Chapter 9521, Acts of 1921. This leaves the last mentioned sections of the 1921 Act in full force and vigor, notwithstanding Chapter 14664, and that being true, relator in this case is without standing to be awarded a writ of prohibition absolute to restrain further proceedings in the case which had been instituted against him in the Civil Court of Record of Duval County. This is necessarily so because relator claims no right to such a writ except such right as may be properly predicated upon and supported by Chapter 14664, and if that Chapter is not applicable to the Civil Court of Record of Duval County, the Civil Court of Record of Duval County has jurisdiction over respondent’s person through the service of process admittedly made upon him in Dade County and such Court should not be prohibited in this proceeding from exercising it.\\nWe are not unmindful of the attack which has been made upon the constitutionality of Chapter 14664 as hereinbefore mentioned, but in view of the fact that the\\' constitutionality of the Act is not necessary to be decided in the present ease, we reserve the constitutional ground for future consideration in a proper case in the event it becomes necessary for us to pass upon it. The demurrer to the suggestion for writ of prohibition should be sustained and the proceeding dismissed because Chapter 14664, Acts of 1931, is not legally applicable to the Civil Court of Record of Duval County, which exists under Chapter 8521, Acts of 1921, and not under Chapter 11357,- Acts of 1925, and an order to that effect will be entered.\\nWrit of prohibition absolute denied and proceeding dismissed.\\nBuford, C.J., and Whitfield, Ellis, Terrell and Brown, J.J., concur.\\n*\\nThe principal contention on constitutional grounds is that the statute as operative is so unjustly discriminatory against litigants having claims cognizable only in Civil Courts of Record in counties where they exist, that it denies due process of law and equal protection of the laws to such litigants.\\n**\\nCourts created under Chapter 11357, Acts of 1925, came into existence in counties having 100,000 or more population according to the last State census. Chapter 8521 had already created a different kind of Civil Court of Record in all counties of more than 100,000 population according to the last Federal census.\\n*\\nTo have provided otherwise might have left the Circuit Courts with jurisdiction of cases within the jurisdictional amounts but not “cognizable” by Civil Courts of Record by reason of their inability to legally perfect service of their process outside the County.

       "       'text': 'OPINION OF THE COURT\\nLeonard N. Cohen, J.\\nPetitioner moves for a turnover of escrow funds held by respondent’s attorney pursuant to respondent’s breach of a stipulation entered into between the parties and their attorneys in open court before a Housing Court Judge. This motion was commenced by show cause order signed by the same Housing Court Judge before whom the stipulation was negotiated and entered, but made returnable to the Civil Court Judge presiding in the Housing Court calendar and motion part.\\nThe sole ground of opposition warranting consideration is respondent’s contention that a Housing Court Judge lacks authority to sign such show cause orders and, therefore, the motion is improperly brought.\\nUnder a Civil Court administrative directive No. 391 dated October 10, 1975, show cause orders \"pertaining to summary proceedings to recover the possession of real property shall be signed only by the Judges presiding in the calendar part of the Housing Part * * * and by no other Judge” and \"they shall be made returnable in said part”.\\nSuch administrative directives are judicial guidelines without binding effect upon Judges. They are hortatory rather than mandatory in form and, as guidelines, are not calculated to interfere with the customary discretion accorded Civil Court Judges. (Kelly St. Block Assn. v Thompson, 64 AD2d 597.)\\nThis directive was issued about three years subsequent to the enactment of section 110 of the New York City Civil Court Act establishing a Housing Court with appointive trial hearing officers and prior to the amendment of subdivision (e) of section 110 of the New York City Civil Court Act on August 11, 1977 effective September 1, 1977, which expressly conferred upon such hearing officers the power \"to hear, determine and grant any relief within the powers of the housing part in any actions or proceeding except those to be tried by jury. Such hearing officers shall have the power of judges of the court to punish for contempts.”\\nThe Housing Court Act was further amended effective June 18, 1978 renaming hearing officers as Housing Judges continuing the same broad powers as Civil Court or Acting Civil Court Judges to hear, determine and grant any relief within the powers of the housing part except for jury trials.\\nIt is therefore clear that notwithstanding the 1975 administrative directive, the Legislature has authorized any Housing Judge, as well as any Civil Court or Acting Civil Court Judge, to grant concurrent Housing Court relief including the signing of show cause orders returnable before Housing Judges.\\nThe 1978 legislative amendment of the Housing Court Act by establishing a new judicial office, Housing Judge, with judicial powers concurrent with a Civil Court Judge to grant any relief other than a jury trial, raises not only administrative and policy considerations, but also a constitutional issue.\\nThe basic origin of the Civil Court is constitutional under section 15 of article VI of the New York State Constitution which provides for Judges to be \"chosen for terms of ten years by the electors of the counties included within the city of New York from districts within such counties established by law.”\\nThe Housing Judges are not elected, but rather appointed for five-year terms by the court’s Administrative Judge from a list of persons selected annually by the advisory council for the housing part. (CCA, § 110, subds [f], [g], [i].)\\nHearing officers, prior to the 1978 legislative amendment, authorized to hear and determine housing nonjury trials, were considered nonjudicial compulsory referees constitutionally exercising judicial functions. (Glass v Thompson, 51 AD2d 69.) However, the court (p 74) there pointed out that \"since the hearing officer is not a Judge of the court, elected as specified in the Constitution, he must be a referee, or lack any power whatever.” The court further stated (p 73) \"If the hearing officer is not a duly elected Judge, or one appointed to fill the unexpired term of such a Judge, and as we have seen, he is not, then he must be a form of referee, for that is the only nonjudicial office which exercises judicial authority.” This reasoning appears to cast doubt on the constitutionality of the recent legislative creation of a new judicial office called Housing Judge.\\nThe State Senate Minority Leader memorandum in support of the 1978 Civil Court Act amendment pointed out that this legislation was \"not intended to change the result in the Glass case”, but it makes no reference to the appellate court’s reasoning in that case, as set forth herein, which appears to raise the unconstitutionality of such a legislative name change. The memorandum also states the legislative purpose for renaming \"hearing officer” to \"Housing Judge” to be an improvement of the stature of such officers and a more \"fitting” title to the position lending it \"vitally needed dignity and greater respect to the court’s proceedings”.\\nThis court is mindful, however, of the strong presumption of constitutionality of a legislative enactment, (Matter of Van Berkel v Power, 16 NY2d 37.) Such a presumption continues until such time that a statute is adjudicated invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction. The appropriate procedure to adjudicate the validity of a statute is an action for a declaratory judgment (Bunis v Conway, 17 AD2d 207) and the proper forum for such adjudication is the Supreme Court (Town of Babylon v Conte, 61 Misc 2d 626; Matter of Voccola v Shilling, 88 Misc 2d 103). A lower court of limited jurisdiction, such as the Civil Court, has no authority to grant that remedy. (Weinstein-Korn-Miller, NY Civ Prac, par 3001.11, and cases thereunder.)\\nAccordingly, the court finds the respondent’s challenge to the show cause order signed by a Housing Judge to be insufficient as a matter of law. The court refers the motion to Housing Court Judge Ralph Waldo Sparks as a continuing jurisdictional matter properly before him involving these parties for final disposition for all purposes.',\n",

Ulsch brought an action in the civil court of record of Duval County against the Mountain City Mill Company for an alleged indebtedness to plaintiff, the declaration containing a special count and common counts. Trial was had on a plea on equitable grounds. Both parties moved for a directed verdict. The court directed a verdict for the plaintiff and rendered judgment thereon, and denied a motion of defendant for new trial. On appeal the circuit court on February 27,» 1931, reversed the judgment for the plaintiff with instructions to the civil court of record “to vacate its said judgment appealed from, and to vacate and set aside the verdict of the jury herein, and its order granting said plaintiff’s motion for an instructed verdict and denying the defendant’s motion for said instructed verdict and to enter judgment for the defendant.” This court granted a-writ of certiorari, and upon hearing and consideration held that the record in the cause did not present any legal issue to be determined and that the equitable plea was not sustained by a preponderance of the evidence; and adjudicated that the “judgment of the circuit court reversing judgment of civil court of record, Duval County, be quashed.” Ulsch vs. Mountain City Mill Co., 103 Fla. 932, 138 So. 483, 486. A petition was filed here asking that a rehearing be granted and that if the judgment of the circuit court is quashed, that the judgment of this court quashing the judgment of the circuit court which reversed the judgment of the civil court of record, “be enlarged by directing the circuit court to order a new trial in said cause and granting to the defendant the privilege to file in said cause a plea to the merits, this to prevent a palpable miscarriage of justice.” On consideration this court entered an Order thus: “Rehearing denied and motion of respondent to give directions refused.” Ulsch v. Mountain City Mill Company, 104 Fla. 418, 140 So. 218-219. The mandate issued by this court is that “the said judgment of the circuit court which reversed the judgment of the civil court of record and remanded the cause with directions to enter judgment in favor of the defendant be and the same is hereby quashed.” Under the statute a copy of the opinions of this court accompany its mandates. Sec. 4691 (2922) C. G. L.\\nIn mandamus proceedings brought by Ulsch against the Circuit Judge it is made to appear that after the receipt of the mandate and accompanying opinions of this court, the Circuit Judge on April 11, 1932, rendered its judgment wherein it is “ordered and adjudged that the judgment of the Civil Court of Record of Duval County, Florida, be, and the same is hereby reversed, and this cause is remanded to said lower court with instructions to said Court to vacate and set aside its judgment appealed from, and to vacate and set aside the verdict of the jury herein, and its order granting said plaintiff’s motion for an instructed verdict, and its order denying the motion of the defendant below for a new trial in said cause and to enter an order in said cause granting to the defendant below a new trial in said cause. It further appearing to the Court from the two opinions handed down by the Supreme Court attached to the mandate in that certain cause lately therein pending wherein N. M. Ulsch was petitioner in certiorari and Mountain City Mill Company, a corporation, was Respondent, that the record on appeal in this cause does not present by way of proper pleading any legal issue as to the defense of the defendant below sought to be set up by way of special plea, it is, further ordered, adjudged and decreed by the Court that upon the remanding of this cause to the Civil Court of Record that said Court enter an order giving leave to the defendant below, Mountain City Mill Company, a corporation, to file in said cause and in said Court such plea or pleas, as advised, pursuant to and in accordance with law and the opinions handed down by the Supreme Court of Florida herein.”\\nThe alternative writ of mandamus commands the Circuit Judge to set aside and vacate the judgment of the Circuit Court of April 11, 1932, which reversed the judgment of the Civil Court of Record, and directs the trial court “to proceed to enter an order vacating and setting aside the order and judgment of the said Circuit Court made and entered under date of February 27th, A. D. 1931, and proceed to enter a judgment affirming the verdict and judgment of the Civil Court of Record therein appealed from on the 10th day of July, A. D. 1930, in obedience to and in accordance with the opinion and mandate of this court;” or to show cause for not doing so.\\nThe respondent Circuit Judge moves to quash the alternative writ of mandamus upon grounds designed to show as a matter of law that the judgment rendered by the Circuit Judge complained of in the writ accords with the mandate and accompanying opinions of this Court in the certiorari proceedings. The motion to quash should be granted.\\nThe first opinion on certiorari, Ulsch v. Mountain City Mill Company, 103 Fla. 932, 138 So. 483-486, contained statements that “the judgment of the civil court of record which was reversed by the circuit court as being contrary to the undisputed evidence in the ease, should stand, the equitable plea not having been sustained by a preponderance of the evidence in favor of the defendant;” and that “the Circuit Judge should have entered a judgment affirming the judgment of the civil court of record.” The quoted statements were not necessary to a proper determination of the question presented in the certiorari proceedings, i. e., whether the judgment of the circuit court reversing the judgment of the civil court of record and directing the trial court to enter judgment for the defendant, should be quashed because it does not accord with the essential requirements of the law. The first opinion also stated that “the record on appeal, upon which the ease was heard and the judgment reversed by the circuit court, did not present by way of a proper pleading, any legal issue as to the right of the plaintiff to recover upon the cause of action sued on” and that the judgment of the trial court should stand, as the equitable plea was not sustained. This court did not hold that the circuit court could not properly reverse the judgment for a neiv trial for error of law in the trial court, Beuttell v. Magone, 157 U. S. 154, but this court did hold that the judgment of the circuit court reversing the judgment of the trial court with directions “to enter judgment for the defendant,” should be quashed. When a judgment at law is reversed for a new trial, further pleadings may ordinarily be allowed unless otherwise directed by the appellate court. Webb Furniture Co., Inc. vs. Everett, 141 So. 115.\\nHowever, the opinion on application for rehearing, Ulsch v. Mountain City Mill Co., 104 Fla. 418, 140 So. 218-219, contains the following:\\n“When a judgment is quashed here on writ of certiorari, that cause is again remitted to' the consideration and determination of the court whose judgment has been set aside. It is consequently within the power of that court to render another judgment not in conflict with the holding of the Supreme Court or other court exercising powers pursuant to the writ of certiorari granted. ’ ’\\n“In the ease at bar, the circuit court, whose judgment of reversal has been quashed, is now at full liberty to render any judgment warranted by the record on appeal from the civil court of record, provided the same be not in conflict with the law of the case as necessarily determined by the proceeding already had in this court.”\\n“We have no authority to' direct what the judgment of the circuit court shall be. We simply quash the judgment heretofore rendered by that court, for the reasons pointed out in our opinion, leaving it to the circuit court to render such new judgment as may be according to law and justice, and not in conflict with what we have heretofore decided.”\\nThe latter opinion also contains a statement that:\\n“the circuit court has authority to enter a proper judgment notwithstanding the fact that we may have already quashed the previous judgment which unconditionally reversed the judgment of the civil court of record and gave it directions to enter a particular judgment for the opposite party.”\\nThe pronouncements of the opinion on application for rehearing necessarily modified the former opinion. If the first opinion may be construed to hold that the Circuit Judge upon receipt of the mandate of this Court, should affirm the judgment of the civil court of record, even though a proper application be duly made for direction or permission for the trial judge to let proper pleas be filed and a new trial be had in due course, such construction of the first opinion is not tenable in view of the opinion on application for rehearing and the terms of the mandate as issued. The mandate from this Court does not require the Circuit Judge to direct the trial court to render a judgment for the defendant. The mandate shows that this court merely quashed “the judgment of the circuit court which reversed the judgment of the civil court of record and remanded the cause with directions to enter judgment in favor of the defendant.”\\nAs to proper appellate action when each party moves in the trial court for a directed verdict in its favor, see Beittell v. Magone, 157 U. S. 154; Empire State Cattle Co. v. Atchison Ry. Co., 220 U. S. 497; Am. Nat'l Bank v. Miller, 229 U. S. 517, 520; Williams v. Freeland, 250 U. S. 295. See also Slocum v. New York Life Ins. Co., 228 U. S. 364.\\nAs stated in the opinion on application for rehearing in the certiorari proceeding, this Court merely quashed the judgment rendered by the Circuit Court on appeal from the Civil Court of Record, “leaving it to the circuit court to render such new judgment as may be according to law and justice, and not in conflict with what we have heretofore decided.” If the judgment rendered by the Circuit Judge April 11, 1932, accords with law and justice, the statements quoted from the first opinion in certiorari do net make such judgment rendered by the Circuit Judge ‘ ‘ conflict with what we have heretofore decided,” because the quoted statements from the first opinion were qualified by the opinion on application for rehearing in the certiorari proceedings.\\nThe motion to quash the alternative writ is granted.\\nTerrell and Brown, J.J., concur.\\nBuford, C.J., and Davis, J., dissent.\\nEllis, J., not participating.\",\n",

Mountain City Mill Co., filed December 21st, 1931, 138 South. Rep. 483, in which it was held:\\n“A circuit court’s judgment affirming or reversing a judgment of the civil court of record may be quashed on certiorari only in a case when, considered with reference to the pleadings and record in the civil court of record, it is not in accordance with the essential requirements of law.”\\n“An equitable plea of the character permitted to be filed in actions at law under our statute is essentially a plea in confession and avoidance inasmuch as it must, of necessity, admit that plaintiff has a case upon which he would be entitled to a judgment at law in the legal proceeding, but which judgment, because of other facts set up in the plea, would nevertheless be such a judgment that a court of equity would grant relief from it as against the plaintiff after he obtained it.”\\n“In a case tried in the civil court of record of Duval County, the record on appeal, upon which the ease was heard and the judgment rendered by the circuit court, did not present, by way of appropriate pleading, any legal issue as to the right of plaintiff to recover upon the cause of action sued on, the only pleading by the defendant being an equitable plea which was not established by the preponderance of the evidence in favor of the plea; held: That judgment by the circuit court reversing plaintiff’s judgment in the civil court of record, on the ground that the undisputed evidence did not sustain plaintiff’s alleged cause of action, was not according to the essential requirements of law, and should he quashed on certiorari.”\\nNo reversible error was made to appear by the record of the proceedings and judgment presented for review in the Circuit Court, and therefore the essential requirements of law demanded the affirmance by the Circuit Court of the judgment of the Civil Court of Record and the judgment of the Circuit Court reversing the judgment of the Civil Court of Record constituted a departure from the essential requirements1 of the law1.\\nAny judgment of reversal by the Circuit Court would be in conflict with the law of the case as stated supra, therefore the motion to quash should be denied and the peremptory writ of mandamus should issue.\\nDavis, J., concurs.',\n",

       "       'text': \"Doerfler, J.\\nThe action is one for unlawful detainer, begun in the civil court of Milwaukee county. The defendant served and filed an answer, and the cause came on for hearing on the 17th day of October, 1928. The defendant then objected to the admission of any evidence, upon the following grounds, to wit:\\n“First. That the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action; second, that the complaint contains no cause of action; third, that the court has no jurisdiction of the person of the defendant; and fourth, that the court has no jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action.”\\nThe objections of the defendant so interposed constitute what is known in the law as a demurrer ore tenus. The following appears from the certified transcript of the docket of the civil court, dated October 19, 1928:\\n“At 9:45 a. m. case called before Branch No. 1. Demurrer argued. Thereupon the court being duly advised in the premises sustains the demurrer ore tenus on the following grounds: First, that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action; second, that the complaint contains no cause of action; and third, that the court has no jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action.\\n“October 19. Plaintiff’s notice of appeal from order sustaining defendant’s demurrer ore terms to plaintiff’s complaint and dismissing complaint, with affidavit of good faith, together with undertaking on appeal. . . . Appellant pays $6 to apply on appeal fees. ...”\\nPlaintiff’s notice of appeal states that the appeal is taken “from the judgment docketed in the above entitled matter . . . sustaining the defendant’s demurrer ore tenus to the plaintiff’s complaint and dismissing said complaint. . . .” The undertaking on appeal also refers to a “judgment sustaining the demurrer ore tenus to the plaintiff’s complaint herein and dismissing said complaint.”\\nThe matter having come on for hearing in the circuit court for Milwaukee county before that branch thereof pre sided over by the Honorable Otto Breidenbach, Judge, and having been argued by the respective parties; the court filed a written opinion', in which opinion the following language appears: “Appeal from order of the civil court sustaining the demurrer ore tenus to the complaint.” After treating what appeared to the parties and the court to be the issue involved in the case, the circuit court’s opinion ends with the following language: “The order of the civil court sustaining defendant’s demurrer ore tenus to the complaint must be overruled with ten dollars costs on motion. Let an order be presented in accordance herewith.”\\nThe order entered, among other things, recites:\\n“The appeal from the order of the civil court of Milwaukee county in the above entitled matter, dated October 9, 1928, sustaining the demurrer ore tenus to the plaintiff’s complaint herein, having come on duly to be heard . . '. : It is now, upon all of the records, files, and proceedings herein, ordered that said order of the civil court.of Milwaukee county be, and the same hereby is, reversed, and that said demurrer, ore tenus be, and the same hereby is, overruled and dismissed. . . . ’\\n“It is. further ordered that this cause be, and the same hereby is, remanded to the civil court of Milwaukee county for further proceedings according to law.”\\nThe notice of entry of the order of the circuit court was thereupon served, in which appears the following language: “You will please take notice that an order was duly made and entered in the above entitled matter ón the 26th day of December, 1928, of which a copy is herewith served upon you.”\\nThe defendant then appealed from the order of the circuit court, and executed an undertaking on such appeal according to law. ’ The record of the civil court aforesaid and of the circuit court are now before this court, and the plaintiff thereupon moved this court to dismiss, the defendant’s appeal upon the ground that the order of the civil court sustaining the demurrer ore tenus is not appealable.\\nThe plaintiff, therefore, on this motion takes the position that the final action of the civil court constituted an order and not a judgment, and that the order sustaining the demurrer ore tenus is not appealable. The position of the defendant is to the effect that although the final action of the civil court in form constitutes an order, it nevertheless in substance is a judgment, and that, being a judgment, an appeal lies therefrom.\\nPlaintiff relies upon the case of Mandelert v. Superior C. L. Co. 104 Wis. 423, 80 N. W. 726, wherein it is said in the syllabus:\\n“A demurrer ore tenus is not a demurrer within the meaning of sub. 3, sec. 3069, Stats. 1898, which authorizes an appeal from an order which ‘sustains or overrules a demurrer; ’ and an appeal cannot be taken from a ruling sustaining a demurrer ore tenus, even though such ruling be embodied in a written order.”\\nThe defendant relies upon the case of Hassler v. Sheets. 169 Wis. 419, 172 N. W. 713, wherein it is said in the syllabus:\\n“A direction of the civil court of Milwaukee county, in an action for unlawful detainer, that ‘this action be and the same is dismissed,’ though in form an order, is in fact and in effect a judgment, and is appealable, being an order of dismissal as distinguished from an order directing judgment of dismissal.”\\nIf the final action of the civil court as revealed by the foregoing docket constitutes a mere order sustaining a demurrer ore tenus, no appeal therefrom lies, and such order cannot be converted into a judgment by the mere fact that the parties thereto treated it as a judgment when in reality it is an order. The express provisions of the statutes on appeal cannot be evaded, either by an agreement between the parties or by a wrong construction placed upon the final action of the civil court; neither could such conversion result from the fact that counsel on the pretended appeal to the circuit court treated such final action of the civil court as a judgment. The right of appeal is statutory, and it exists only where the statute authorizes it.\\nTo hold that the circuit court had jurisdiction under the foregoing facts as disclosed by the docket and the record would result in an annihilation of the statutory provisions on appeal. The language employed by the learned civil’ court clearly constitutes its final action as an order and not a judgment, and the language so employed is clearly distinguishable from that used in the Hassler Case, supra.\\nThe final action of the circuit court on the pretended appeal unmistakably manifests that the appeal was from an order and not from a judgment, and it is also manifest from the record that the issue now before us was at no time presented to the circuit court, but that such court of its own accord treated the appeal as one from an order and not from a judgment, evidently laboring under the mistaken impression that such an order was appealable.\\nBy the Court. — It is therefore ordered that plaintiff’s motion be granted and that the appeal be dismissed; and that the cause be remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\",\n",

       "       'text': 'OPINION OF THE COURT\\nIra B. Harkavy, J.\\nThe whole is greater than its parts!\\nThis case is one of the growing line of cases which highlights the necessity for a unified court system in New York State.\\nThis motion was brought on by defendant for an order dismissing the action against the defendant, District Council 37 Health & Security Plan Trust, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, or in the alternative, transferring the action to the Supreme Court. The relief herein requested, while possible under a unified court system, cannot be accomplished through the mechanism of bringing on a motion to transfer in the Civil Court of the City of New York.\\nThe instant matter was advanced from June 11, 1985 by virtue of defendant-movant District Council 37 Health & Security Plan Trust providing a brief pursuant to order of the undersigned dated April 30, 1985.\\nThe present action arose out of the interpretation of the terms of a trusteed employee benefit plan entered into as the result of collective bargaining between the City of New York and District Council 37, AFSCME (AFL-CIO). The terms, obligations and benefits of the plan are embodied in an 18-page document entitled “Amended and Restated Agreement and Declaration of Trust District Council 37 Health & Security Plan Trust.”\\nPursuant to subdivision 1.2 of article 1 of the Health & Security Plan Trust, an uncompensated board of trustees is empowered to receive employer contributions in accordance with various collective bargaining agreements. The board of trustees through its agents then utilizes these sums to provide numerous welfare benefits to “covered members”, who are or formerly were employees represented by subscribing collective bargaining units.\\nSubdivision 1.2 of article 1 of the Health & Security Plan Trust specifically provides that the collected contributions are to be used for providing “life, sick, accident and other benefits which may be permitted under Section 501 (c) (9) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954”. More specifically, the rules of the plan for covered active employees provides in part A, §§ IIA through VIIIA inclusive, that such active employees are entitled to death, accidental death and dismemberment, weekly disability income, dental, optical, drug, and catastrophic medical benefits.\\nIn the fall of 1984 the plaintiff herein, Henry L. Mallardi, made a claim for reimbursement under the dental portion of the Health & Security Plan Trust. That claim was denied.\\nSubsequently, the plaintiff brought an action for $1,000 in the Civil Court of the City of New York, Small Claims Part, County of Kings, alleging “breach of dental contract — no reimbursement.” Relief sought was the $1,000 together with interest from September 1984.\\nIn response to the complaint, the defendant brought on the instant motion. On April 30, 1985, the undersigned adjourned the motion with instructions to the defendant to submit a brief on the issue of whether the Civil Court has authority to transfer this case from the Small Claims Part to the Supreme Court. The necessity for the defendant’s brief were the issues raised by the moving papers with regard to subject matter jurisdiction. The questions presented involve whether the plaintiff is or is not a beneficiary of the Health & Security Plan Trust and if the plaintiff is in fact a beneficiary then a construction of the rules of the Health & Security Plan Trust, together with a determination as to whether the plaintiff has complied with the rules of the trust.\\nIn order to reach the above questions raised by the defendant, this court would have to sit as a court in equity. Such action cannot be undertaken inasmuch as the Civil Court of the City of New York lacks equity jurisdiction in suits of this nature.\\nOver a decade ago, the Supreme Court, Appellate Division, Second Department, in Matter of Heilman v Ploss (46 AD2d 658, 660 [1974]), a case involving interpretation of benefits under a pension fund, noted that: “It is obvious that the Civil Court of the City of New York has no equitable jurisdiction, except as specifically provided by statute, and therefore, has no jurisdiction of the subject matter of an action against the trustees of a pension fund to recover pension benefits, which requires, in the first instance, a declaration by them that the plaintiff is a beneficiary of the trust.” In accord was the Supreme Court, Appellate Term, First Department, in Kaminsky v Connolly (73 Misc 2d 789 [1972]; Sommers v Horsford, NYLJ, Feb. 13,1976, p 10, col 3).\\nThis uncontroverted status of the law requires this court to reach the ultimate issue of whether the Civil Court of the City of New York has authority and a mechanism to properly transfer a small claims matter in equity to the New York State Supreme Court for disposition.\\nThe defendant herein, District Council 37 Health & Security Plan Trust, avers that authority for a Civil Court ordered transfer can be found in NY Constitution, article VI, § 19 (f). The relevant portion, with bracketed material inserted, of article VI, § 19 (f) provides: “The courts for the City of New York established pursuant to section fifteen [Civil Court of the City of New York] of this article shall transfer to the supreme court or the surrogate’s court or the family court any action or proceeding which has not been transferred to them from any of said courts and over which the said courts for the city of New York have no jurisdiction.”\\nTwo seminal cases interpreting this constitutional provision have emerged from the Appellate Term of the Supreme Court, First Department: Wolffs v District Council 37 Health Sec. Plan (filed Oct. 16, 1980) and Walker v District Council 37 Health & Sec. Plan Trust (filed June 19,1984). Both of these Per Curiam decisions reversed judgments against the defendant in the instant case and in its appellate discretion ordered the matters transferred to the Supreme Court to decide the equity issues set forth above.\\nThe defendant herein has persisted in attempting to have the Civil Court sidestep CPLR 325 (b) in favor of requesting a short-form order directing the small claims clerk to forward the files to the Clerk of the Supreme Court for appropriate disposition. This position ignores the administrative reality that there does not exist a mechanism for the orderly transfer of New York City Civil Court cases in equity to the State-wide Supreme Court system.\\nThe Civil Court of the City of New York exists as a court of limited jurisdiction separately administered from the Statewide Supreme Court system. As such, transfer of cases between the systems is governed by strict procedures set forth in CPLR 325. The Clerk of the Civil Court cannot transfer a case to the Supreme Court or force the Supreme Court to accept a case commenced in Civil Court.\\nThis case is yet another example of the need for a unified court system. While the Supreme Court has authority under CPLR 325 (b) to transfer this matter, the Civil Court as a component of a separate court system may not.\\nThe mistaken effort made by defendant’s counsel in bringing on this motion in the improper forum was ill advised. Had this motion been properly brought in the Supreme Court pursuant to CPLR 325 (b) it would most probably have resulted in obtaining the relief herein requested.\\nThe defendant is hereby directed to make an appropriate motion for transfer of this case pursuant to CPLR 325 (b) in the Supreme Court, Kings County. If upon the expiration of 60 days after receipt by defendant of this order a motion pursuant to CPLR 325 (b) has not been made in Supreme Court, Kings County, this case will be deemed a proper action for Civil Court and the case will continue as an action for moneys due and owing. The case is adjourned to August 15, 1985, pending defendant’s motion.',\n",

       "       'text': 'Quillian, Judge.\\nThe defendant, appellant here, makes two principal contentions: (1) that the Civil Court of Fulton County is a court of record, and, hence, the Georgia Civil Practice Act (and therefore Rule 10 of the Civil Court) is applicable to all cases before it regardless of amount; (2) if there do exist two sets of rules in the Civil Court of Fulton County, predicated on whether the amount involved is $300 or less, this constitutes a violation of the due process and equal protection clauses of the United States Constitution.\\n1. Since its inception there has been a basic dichotomy in the Civil Court of Fulton County. Our appellate courts in construing, inter alia, Georgia Laws 1933 have recognized this fact. As held in Vincent v. Garmon, 95 Ga. App. 642, 643 (98 SE2d 408): \"For this court to have jurisdiction of a case from the Civil Court of Fulton County involving less than $300 the appeal must be taken from the judgment of the appellate division of such court, while in cases involving more than $300 the appeal must be made direct to this court from the Trial Division of the Civil Court of Fulton County.” See Cardell v. Bank of Ga., 78 Ga. App. 134 (50 SE2d 876); Milikin v. Johnson, 78 Ga. App. 479 (51 SE2d 561); Atlanta Laundricoin Corp. v. Hunnicutt, 93 Ga. App. 87 (91 SE2d 127); Pendley v. Union Bankers Ins. Co., 99 Ga. App. 189 (107 SE2d 910); Davis v. Hulsey, 102 Ga. App. 317 (116 SE2d 313); Gavant v. Berger, 182 Ga. 277 (185 SE 506).\\nIn essence as to amounts of less than $300 the court serves as a justice court. See Art. VI, Sec. VII, Par. I of the Georgia Constitution of 1945 (Code Ann. § 2-4201); Ga. L. 1913, pp. 145, 158. While as to amounts of $300 or more the court now has the status of a court of record within the meaning of the Civil Practice Act, see Ga. L. 1956, pp. 3271, 3273, Section 23 (a); Cole v. Cates, 113 Ga. App. 540, 542 (149 SE2d 165). See DeKalb County v. Deason, 221 Ga. 237 (144 SE2d 446), dealing with what constitutes a court of record.\\nWe adopt the result reached in the thorough and learned examination of this topic contained in the opinion of the presiding judge of the Appellate Division of the Civil Court of Fulton County. We quote from that opinion: \"Originally, the only record required to be kept by the Municipal Court of Atlanta was a filing docket (Ga. L. 1913, p. 163); however, through an evolution of amendatory enactments, Sec. 36 of the original Act of 1913 was amended by Ga. L. 1956, p. 3273, which created a new section of the original Act known as \\'Sec. 23 (a).’ That section states in part as follows: \\'the clerk of said court shall keep a book of minutes, properly indexed, wherein he shall record or cause to be recorded all judgments of said court and verdicts of juries rendered therein, wherein the principal amount of said verdict or judgment or the value of the property involved in said verdict or judgment is fixed at or exceeds the sum of three hundred ($300) dollars, together with all orders of said court pertaining thereto. The minutes shall be approved by the chief judge of said court on the last day of each term.’ In 1959 (Ga. L. 1959, p. 2201) the General Assembly amended the Act creating the Civil Court of Fulton County by adding to said Act a new section appropriately numbered and reading as follows: \\'Section 23 (b). From and after the passage of this Act the Clerk of the Civil Court of Fulton County shall be authorized and may from time to time upon the direction of the chief judge of said court, destroy or dispose of old records of said court which have served their usefulness and, which in the opinion of said chief judge, have no further value to the court or to the public, but are merely occupying valuable filing space. The authority hereby granted shall include all of the books, papers and documents of said court now in the possession of said clerk or which may hereafter come into his possession, of any nature and kind whatsoever, which in the case of civil pleadings are at least twenty-five (25) years old, and in the case of criminal warrants, are at least five (5) years old, and which, as aforesaid, in the opinion of the chief judge of said court have served their usefulness and are no longer of value to anyone. Nothing in this Act shall authorize the destruction or disposal of the minutes, the dockets or the indices of the Civil Court of Fulton County.’ It necessarily follows, from a reading of the foregoing, that upon the creation of the Municipal Court of Atlanta there was no statutory authority for permanency of records; that permanency of record keeping for the Civil Court of Fulton County was required by an amendment to the Act creating the court which added the above Sec. 23 (a); however, those amendatory provisions only required permanency of records as to cases [of $300 or more], and further by Acts of 1959 which added Sec. 23 (b) to the original Act creating this court all other records of the court could be destroyed with the exception of the minutes, the dockets or the indices of this court. There being no statutory authority for this court to maintain minutes, dockets or indices in cases [of less than $300], even if it did the same may be destroyed. It is therefore our opinion and decision that as to cases in the principal amount [of less than $300], the Civil Court of Fulton County is not a court of record; therefore the procedure as outlined in the Georgia Civil Practice Act does not apply to the Civil Court of Fulton County in such instances. Appellant contends that Rule 10 of the Civil Court of Fulton County should apply to all cases in that court. Succinctly, Rule 10 paraphrases Code Ann. Sec. 81A-155 (a) which allows default judgments to be opened as a matter of right upon motion filed within 15 days from the date of the judgment and upon the payment of cost and filing of defensive pleadings. Said rule was adopted pursuant to the power vested in the judges of the Civil Court of Fulton County pursuant to Sec. 19 of the Act of the General Assembly of Georgia approved August 30, 1913 (p. 154). That section provides, in part, that rules of procedure and practice shall not be inconsistent with the laws of this State. Sec. 46 of the Acts of 1913, p. 171, having never been re pealed provides that a judgment entered by default may be opened, as a matter of right, within 5 days from the rendition of the same, subject to other procedural requirements. We hold that we are bound by this express statutory requirement in cases [of less than $300], and to hold otherwise would create a rule inconsistent with statutory authority. We further hold that Gresham v. Symmers, 227 Ga. 616 is not applicable to the case in question. Gresham v. Symmers deals with the Civil and Criminal Court of DeKalb County which the General Assembly (Ga. L. 1968, pp. 2928, 2932) declared to be a \\'court of record,’ requiring for that court an index of all cases filed; dockets showing final disposition of all cases; original pleadings in civil cases; and accusations and sentences in criminal cases and further providing that none of those records shall thereafter be destroyed but that they shall be microfilmed and kept as permanent records of the court. In cases [of less than $300] in the Civil Court of Fulton County there is no such statutory requirement, nor permanent record keeping.”\\nSince the amount here involved was less than $300 the trial judge properly applied Section 46 of Georgia Laws 1913, pp. 145, 171, and declined to open the default.\\n2. This case was transferred to this court from the Supreme Court which means that the appellant failed to properly raise any questions as to the constitutionality of certain statutes which in the first division of this opinion were held to be controlling.

       "       'text': 'OPINION OF THE COURT\\nPhilip S. Straniere, J.\\nPlaintiffs, Jessica Arvelo (Arvelo), an infant, by her parent and natural guardian, David Arvelo, and David Arvelo, individually, moved by oral motion during the course of the nonjury trial of the action for permission to file a late notice of claim against the defendant, New York City Board of Education. Defendants, City of New York and the New York City Board of Education, oppose the motion on the ground that the Civil Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain the motion pursuant to General Municipal Law § 50-e (7).\\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\\nPlaintiff, Arvelo, commenced an action against the defendants for personal injuries sustained during gym class at I.S. 2 in November 1995. Plaintiff alleges that the defendants were negligent in the supervision, instruction and safety of the plaintiff during the class. It is uncontroverted that a notice of claim was served on the defendant, City of New York. The note of issue indicates that service of the summons and complaint was completed on April 17, 1996 and issue was joined on May 20, 1996. The action was transferred to this court on April 21, 1998 pursuant to CPLR 325 (d) by order of the Honorable John Leone. During the course of the presentation of plaintiff’s case, at trial it was determined that plaintiff had failed to file a notice of claim against the defendant, Board of Education, notwithstanding the allegation in paragraph “2” of the complaint that “on or about November 28, 1995 a notice of claim was served upon the comptroller in compliance with the requirements of the General Municipal Law and the Education Law.”\\nISSUES PRESENTED\\nI. Does the Civil Court have jurisdiction, to decide a motion to file a late notice of claim?\\nThe court is presented with the initial issue of whether the Civil Court has jurisdiction to entertain a motion to serve a late notice of claim. The mainstream case law and defendants’ position hold that this question is reserved by statute exclusively for the province of the Supreme or County Courts. For the following reasons, the court disagrees and finds that it has jurisdiction to address plaintiffs motion on the ground that the exclusion of the Civil Court from the statute renders General Municipal Law § 50-e (7) unconstitutional.\\nThe Civil Court of the City of New York obtains its jurisdiction from both New York Constitution, article VI, § 15 and the various statutes of the State as adopted by the New York State Legislature. The Civil Courts of the City of New York were constitutionally established in 1962, generally replacing the former City and Municipal Courts. While the Civil Court does not have initial jurisdiction to entertain actions involving sums of money in excess of $25,000, it may be endowed with jurisdiction to do so where the Supreme Court transfers an action pursuant to CPLR 325 (d), as was done in the instant case. CPLR 325 (d) provides that “a court in which an action is pending may, in its discretion, remove such action without consent to such lower court where it appears that the amount of damages sustained may be less than demanded, and the lower court would have had jurisdiction but for the amount of damages demanded.” Thus, there is no dispute that this court has jurisdiction to hear the merits of this action.\\nThe controversy arises concerning the power of this court to decide plaintiffs motion to file the late notice of claim. Defendant relies on General Municipal Law § 50-e (7), added in 1976 (L 1976, ch 745, § 2), which provides that all applications regarding leave to serve a late notice “shall be made to the supreme court or to the county court.” While the statute on its face appears to prohibit an application for this relief to the Civil Court, an examination of the underlying logic of the statute and its legislative history reveals that the Civil Court is, in fact, an appropriate forum for this redress.\\nWith minor exceptions, the constitutional and statutory civil jurisdiction of the Civil and County Courts, as lower courts, mirror each other. They are both courts of limited monetary jurisdiction ($25,000) and have certain express but limited pow ers regarding such matters as mechanic’s liens, foreclosures, deed and contract rescissions and reform. County Courts, which operate in most counties of New York State, no longer exist in the five boroughs of New York City, having been constitutionally abolished and replaced by the unique structure of the Civil Court in 1962.\\nA strict reading of General Municipal Law § 50-e (7) would mandate the conclusion that litigants in New York City whose cases find their way to the Civil Court, either ah initia or by way of a CPLR 325 (d) transfer, must initiate a section 50-e (7) motion only in Supreme Court, while the remaining residents of the State have the possible option of the County or Supreme Courts, depending upon, among other things, their residency or where their case was initiated. In the first situation, a plaintiff who is seeking damages of less than $25,000 and commenced an action in the New York City Civil Court, having become familiar with, and subject to, its particular procedural and calendar requirements and rules, perhaps having engaged in extensive motion practice and, as in this case, began its trial, is required to leave the environs of the Civil Court and bring a motion in Supreme Court. The concomitant result is a further congestion of the Supreme Court’s calendar, at additional expense, including filing fees and yet another waiting period, for the sole purpose of obtaining permission to file a late notice of claim in order to continue the prosecution of the very case commenced in Civil Court. The second possibility would be those cases where the Supreme Court has, by its experience, determined that a certain action should be transferred to the lower court for all purposes (i.e., County or Civil Court) pursuant to CPLR 325 (d). A plaintiff sent to the Civil Court is still required to seek redress back in the Supreme Court (conceivably at any stage in the litigation) for permission to file a late notice of claim. Significantly, once an action is transferred to the Civil Court, pursuant to CPLR 325 (d), it remains in the Civil Court for all purposes, including pretrial and posttrial motions and posttrial judgment enforcement and execution proceedings. Additionally, once a case has been removed to the Civil Court from Supreme Court, its appellate route is to the Appellate Term, rather than the Appellate Division. Defendant would have us accept the irrational conclusion that the Legislature saw fit to endow the Civil Court with the wisdom and power to resolve all legal issues except for permission to file a late notice of claim.\\nDefendant, City, argues that it does not waive its right to assert this defense, which may be raised at any time in the proceeding. The most onerous results attend to the litigant who has commenced its action in the Civil Court, availed itself of the procedures and adhered to the rules of the Civil Court, and yet is compelled to seek a remedy in the Supreme Court. This procedure creates a disparity among litigants, based solely on their place of residence in New York State, which the Legislature had no rational basis for instituting. Consequently, a plaintiff who has proceeded through an entire course of litigation, including discovery and pretrial motions in the Civil Court may, as a result of the strict application of General Municipal Law § 50-e (7), find its trial put on hold while the attorneys travel to Supreme Court for the first and only time, simply and exclusively for the purpose of a ruling on the motion. The illogical consequence is that, should plaintiffs motion be granted by the Supreme Court, the remainder of the litigation would continue in Civil Court, with the parties again becoming passengers on the Castleton Avenue bus and shuttle between Supreme and Civil Courts. Owing to the time involved in the process, it would be extremely likely that if a jury had been impaneled, it would have had to have been disbanded and a new trial started. This, of course, makes no sense and is a waste of precious and sorely needed judicial resources.\\nThe court’s research on this question uncovered a paucity of cases. Those which speak favorably to the issue of late filing of a notice of claim primarily involve small claims actions in which the concept of “substantial justice” was the predicate for allowing a more flexible application of the statute, thereby deeming it permissible to grant the application for relief in the Small Claims Part of the Civil Court, contrary to the dictates of the statute (Schneider v Town of Orangetown, 171 Misc 2d 497 [Just Ct, Rockland County 1997]; Resnick v New York City Health & Hosps. Corp., 161 Misc 2d 156 [Civ Ct, Richmond County 1994]; Lurie v New York City Off. of Comptroller, 154 Misc 2d 950 [Civ Ct, NY County 1992]). While the court applauds the erudition and reasoning followed in this line of cases, and agrees with their holdings, it cannot accept the premise that a litigant, by choosing the Small Claims Part of the Civil Court, benefits from a more inclusive standard of justice than those who, by choice or necessity, find their case in the Civil Court. Justice cannot be a rubber band which expands and contracts depending upon the court which holds it.\\nThe attending result of this disparity is that the Legislature, in adopting General Municipal Law § 50-e (7), has created a restriction on a class of persons, i.e., residents of the City of New York, which results in a denial of equal protection of the laws for those persons, without any rational basis.\\nProfessor McLaughlin, in analyzing the constitutionality of CPLR 325 (d), notes that: “some have argued that the section is unconstitutional, as a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, for it would then discriminate between litigants without any rational basis” (McLaughlin, Practice Commentaries, McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 7B, CPLR C325:4, at 568). Professor McLaughlin also emphasizes other problems with the statute, noting that: “[a] second procedural quirk, fraught with constitutional overtones, is that when a case is transferred from the Supreme Court to the Civil Court, any appeal must go to the Appellate Term. From the Appellate Term it can get to the Appellate Division only by permission of the court” (ibid.). McLaughlin goes on to state that, had the action remained in the Supreme Court, the appeal would have gone directly to the Appellate Division, making the route to the Court of Appeals easier. “Compounding the constitutional problem,” he says, is that the Third and Fourth Departments have no Appellate Term; therefore, appeals from the inferior courts go through the Appellate Division (ibid.). While not offering a conclusive finding, Professor McLaughlin provocatively proffers that: “[t]his discrimination between citizens in different parts of the state is questionable.” (Ibid.) In concluding his commentary, he notes that: “there seems an inherent unfairness in requiring a plaintiff, who files his case in Supreme Court, to pay Supreme Court filing and jury fees, but, when the action is transferred to, say, the New York City Civil Court, the plaintiff is limited to recovering Civil Court costs and fees.” (Ibid.) While we address here a different statute, Professor McLaughlin, in questioning the constitutionality of the disparity of treatment among litigants, raises an issue equally applicable to the analysis of the General Municipal Law.\\nIt would seem that the Legislature, by providing that a motion for permission for late filing of a notice of claim be made in either Supreme or County Court, intended that a lower court of limited jurisdiction would also have the jurisdiction to determine the issue, but inadvertently omitted the reference to the Civil Court. What other rational basis would there have been for the Legislature to have included the lower County Court and omitted the Civil Court, its fraternal jurisdictional twin? Had the Legislature limited the venue to Supreme Court, all citizens of the State, regardless of the situs of their action or their residence, would have been required to travel the same path in the court system. However, the Legislature created certain judicial tributaries for some litigants to follow depending, in part, on their residence, but neglecting to provide New York Civil Court litigants with a similar logical avenue. The Legislature can, of course, do this, but it must have a rational basis. The court is unable to discern or postulate one.\\nAn analysis of the legislative history of General Municipal Law § 50-e (7) is persuasively elucidating by its omission of any discussion concerning the rational basis for not including the Civil Court. Nowhere in the myriad documents submitted in support of or in opposition to the bill is there any relevant discussion regarding the Legislature’s intention with respect to the omission of the Civil Court. The salient purpose of the statute was cogently stated by the Legislature in its statement of the rationale of the bill noting that it was: “[t]o give a more equitable balance by breathing greater flexibility into section 50-e without defeating its basic purpose; codifying existing decisional law on troublesome questions, and overruling decisional law and repealing or amending existing statutes that do not reflect the basic purpose of notice of claim statutes or that have led to unjust results.” (Mem in Support, Bill Jacket, L 1976, ch 745.) In support of the bill, the Judicial Council also emphasized that the bill would achieve flexibility and fairness. In its introductory passage, it stated:\\n“The Judicial Council recommends that all provisions of law which now prescribe different formalities for notices of claims against municipal and district corporations be incorporated in a new section 50-e of the General Municipal Law adapted to modern and progressive concepts of the law of procedure.\\n“The general purpose of the proposed new section is to effect uniformity throughout the state as to requirements for notice of claims against municipal corporations.\\n“The requirement of notice is one of the safeguards devised by the law to protect municipalities against fraudulent and stale claims for injuries to person and property. It is designed to afford the municipality opportunity to make an early investigation of the claim while the facts surrounding the alleged claim are still ‘fresh’. On the other hand, ‘these provisions [notice statutes] were not intended as a trap for the unwary and the ignorant/\\n“An examination of the decisional law, however, indicates that far too often technicalities in this field have prevented the disposition of honest claims on their merits.” (Recommended Improvements and Unification of Requirements of Notices of Claim Against Municipal Corps, Bill Jacket, L 1976, ch 745 [emphasis added].)\\nThe Legislature’s omission of the Civil Court defies its own rationale and that espoused by the Judicial Council in that the omission results in a lack of uniformity, and strict technicalities which serve only to hamper justice rather than promote it.\\nInterestingly, and in further support of the possibility of legislative oversight, the introductory paragraph to Judiciary Law § 190 states that: “[t]he jurisdiction of each county court, except the county courts of counties within the city of New York, extends to the following actions and special proceedings” (emphasis added). This section was amended in 1984 (L 1984, ch 11) and 1988 (L 1988, ch 477), over 20 years after the County Courts were abolished by the New York Constitution. However, the incorrect reference to the County Courts of New York City was not deleted and still exists in the statute. Noteworthy is the fact that in 1969 (L 1969, ch 699) the Legislature added Judiciary Law § 182, in which they designated “[t]he number of judges of the county court in each county to be as follows.” Former subdivision (39) of that section designated Richmond County as having one County Court Judge even though the New York Constitution had seven years previously eliminated this position from Richmond County. Subsequently, the error was corrected. This is another example of legislative oversight or confusion resulting from the multiplicity of courts in this State. Clearly, the Legislature has before it a Herculean task in substituting or adding the Civil Court each time it must delete, modify or amend a statute involving the jurisdiction and powers of the former County Courts in New York City. There, in fact, exist numerous sections of the statutes that apparently give only the County Court the power to hear a particular matter, and an analysis of each particular statute makes it impossible to determine on its face whether there is, in fact, a rational basis for not granting the Civil Court similar powers.\\nIn determining the constitutionality of a statute or government activity, absent invidious discrimination or denial of a fundamental right, the statute or activity must be found unconstitutional if there is no rational basis for a classification or the disparity in treatment of citizens similarly situated (Matter of Tolub v Evans, 58 NY2d 1 [1982]; Board of Educ. v New Paltz United Teachers, 44 NY2d 890 [1978]; Matter of Pascual v State Bd. of Law Examiners, 79 AD2d 1054 [3d Dept 1981], lv denied 54 NY2d 601; Robert v Ford Motor Co., 73 AD2d 1025 [3d Dept 1980]; Matter of Parker v Kolb, 62 AD2d 128 [3d Dept 1978]). Accordingly, based on the foregoing reasons, the court finds that General Municipal Law § 50-e (7) is unconstitutional in that there is no rational basis for the disparity of treatment or the imposition of a greater burden of seeking redress in the Supreme Court for permission to file a late notice of claim on the litigants of Civil Court and, more particularly, residents of New York City. The court further finds no rational basis for the Legislature’s exclusion of the New York City Civil Court in the statutory scheme and creation of this disparate burden on New York City residents as compared to the residents of the other counties who have available the use of either the Supreme Court or County Court, the lower court having similar jurisdiction to that of the New York City Civil Court. Therefore, the court will entertain plaintiff’s motion to file a late notice of claim; for to refuse to do so would deprive plaintiff of the equal protection of the laws as guaranteed by the United States and the New York Constitutions (US Const 14th Amend; NY Const, art I, § 11).\\nII. May the court grant permission to file a late notice of claim?\\nThe court is now presented with the question of whether plaintiff is entitled to file a late notice of claim against the defendant, Board of Education of the City of New York. General Municipal Law § 50-e (5) states that: “[u]pan application, the court, in its discretion, may extend the time to serve a notice of claim * * * In determining whether to grant the extension, the court shall consider, in particular, whether the public corporation or its attorney * * * acquired actual knowledge of the essential facts * * * The court shall also consider all other relevant facts and circumstances, including: whether the claimant was an infant * * * whether the claimant in serving a notice of claim made an excusable error concerning the identity of the public corporation against which the claim should be asserted; and whether the delay in serving the notice of claim substantially prejudiced the public corporation in maintaining its defense on the merits” (emphasis added). The court recognizes the line of cases which stringently applies the statutory rule precluding plaintiff from filing a late notice of claim (Pierson v City of New York, 56 NY2d 950 [1982]; Matter of Zbryski v City of New York, 147 AD2d 705 [2d Dept 1989]). However, for the foregoing reasons, and guided by the above statutory considerations, the court will grant plaintiffs motion and permit a late filing of notice of claim against the defendant, New York City Board of Education.\\nPlaintiff commenced this action against the defendants, City of New York and New York City Board of Education, in 1996 as a result of personal injuries sustained in 1995. General Municipal Law § 50-e (1) (a) requires that: “ [i] n any case founded upon tort where a notice of claim is required by law as a condition precedent to the commencement of an action or special proceeding against a public corporation * * * the notice of claim shall comply with and be served in accordance with the provisions of this section within ninety days after the claim arises.” It is uncontroverted that a notice of claim was filed against the defendant, City of New York. Education Law, title V, article 77, § 3813 (2) provides that: “no action or special proceeding founded upon tort shall be prosecuted or maintained against any of the parties named in this section * * * unless a notice of claim shall have been made and served in compliance with section fifty-e of the general municipal law.” This statute also sets forth the same criteria for consideration for the filing of a late notice of claim as the General Municipal Law.\\nDue to inadvertence, plaintiff failed to file a separate notice of claim against the defendant, New York City Board of Education. However, the City of New York and the Board of Education interposed a single answer, and defended the action by its Corporation Counsel. Of particular significance is the fact that the Office of Corporation Counsel represents both the City of New York and the New York City Board of Education, unlike other departments or agencies of the City, which are represented by different counsel. The practical consequence is that the Board of Education, through its counsel, had knowledge of the details and facts of this incident early in the litigation, once the notice of claim was filed against the defendant, City. There is no claim in this action that the defendant, Board of Education, did not have adequate notice of the facts to investigate the alleged incident and mount an informed and well-prepared defense, which, in fact, it did from the inception, and continued to do so through the presentation of plaintiffs case during the trial. Defendant, Board of Education, has not put forth any evidence to indicate that it would have defended this action any differently had the plaintiff completed the ministerial task and filed a notice of claim at the Board of Education’s offices.\\nMoreover, there is no prejudice to the defendant as a result of any late filing, in view of the City’s actual notice of the incident and its details and the defense of the action. To deny this plaintiff her day in court would result in severe prejudice to the plaintiff, effectively dismissing her claim. While this may expose plaintiff’s counsel to a malpractice claim, this harsh result serves only to further penalize the plaintiff for a ministerial oversight which can otherwise be easily rectified at no cost to the defendant. Plaintiff would be left with the sole remedy of a malpractice action, in which she, by her guardian, in order to prevail, would have to successfully prove her claim against the City and the Board of Education. Thus, her attorney would become the insurer of the defendants while they escape liability for their judicially determined wrongful acts. Additionally, plaintiff would be required to endure further time and expense to institute a plenary action against her counsel, with no assurance of success, and possibly left with only the ravages of a long, arduous journey through the court system. Certainly, had Odysseus been required to deal with the court system rather than battle the Cyclops on his journey home, Penelope would have remarried, his dog would have died, and millions of students would have been spared having to read the Odyssey. Public policy demands that litigation be decided on the merits whenever possible and that tortfeasors bear the responsibility for their own wrongful acts. Technicalities should not be used to circumvent justice.\\nThe court distinguishes this case from those in which no notice of claim at all was filed by the plaintiff. Here, the additional ministerial task of further serving the Board of Education, although designed to specifically put the Board of Education on notice of the action, was a mere superfluous act in light of the Board of Education’s knowledge of the action as a result of the notice of claim filed against the defendant, City of New York. Furthermore, the Board of Education does not conduct its own examination, under oath, of the claimant but utilizes the Corporation Counsel for that purpose under General Municipal Law § 50-h. This scenario is fraught with havoc and confusion for the litigant who is to be burdened with this harsh result for failure to perform a ministerial act which defies logic and common sense in the instant case. Adding to this confusion is the fact that if a litigant consults the Administrative Code of the City of New York, he will find that although it provides the specific requirements regarding actions against the City, there is no mention of the specific procedure for claims against the Board of Education, except to state that the “comptroller may require any person presenting for settlement an account or claim * * * for any cause against the city or the board of education, to be sworn before the comptroller * * * to answer orally as to any facts relative to the justness of such account or claim * * * In adjusting and settling such claims, the comptroller, as far as practicable, shall be governed by the rules of law and principles of equity which prevail in courts of justice.” (Administrative Code, tit 7, ch 2, § 7-203 [actions against New York City — settlement of claims].) This is another example of the disjointed and piecemeal approach to the notice of claims process in the City of New York, which is overburdened with technicalities that create a maze from which the litigant cannot exit.\\nThe court also notes that the New York State Trial Lawyers Association, a widely subscribed to and respected group, publishes as a service to its members a statement entitled “Time Limitations: Notice of Claims” which is a summary of the time and manner of service on municipal corporations. Interestingly, the list describes the notice of claim process for, inter alla, the City of New York, Transit Authority, Health and Hospitals Corporation, New York City Housing Authority and the New York City School Construction Authority. However, nowhere on the list is there a description for the notice of claim filing on the Board of Education, despite the fact that there is a separate statutory filing requirement under the Education Law. This is a curious omission for such an esteemed group, in view of the volume of tort actions that are filed each year against the City of New York involving the Board of Education.\\nAccordingly, following a consideration of all the relevant facts and circumstances as heretofore discussed, including the fact that there is no prejudice to the defendants, plaintiffs motion for a late filing is granted (Matter of Continental Ins. v City of Rye, 257 AD2d 573 [2d Dept 1999]; Matter of Peterson v City of New York, 73 Misc 2d 618 [Sup Ct, Queens County 1973]). Inasmuch as the trial of the action has already commenced, the trial will continue on June 14, 1999 at 9:30 a.m. at the courthouse, 927 Castleton Avenue, Staten Island, New York. The fairest, most equitable and commonsense solution is that the court will entertain an application by the defendants for an opportunity to conduct further discovery, if necessary, and upon good cause shown.',\n",

       "       'text': 'WingeRT, J.\\nWe consider that the trial court was right in holding that the subject matter of plaintiffs complaint against Donaldson Oldsmobile Company is not res ad judicata by virtue of the proceedings in the civil court.\\nThe matter came before the civil court in the course of the replevin action, on a motion by Stobbe to interplead Donaldson. Had such interpleader been granted, Stobbe would then have been in position to file and serve a cross complaint against Donaldson Oldsmobile Company, asserting her claims arising out of the transaction by which she purchased the automobile. Elder v. Sage, 257 Wis. 214, 222, 42 N. W. (2d) 919. Sec. 263.15 (1), Stats. 1955, then in effect, authorized demand for relief by cross complaint, and service of such cross complaint, upon a person not a party “upon his being brought in.”\\nIn the replevin action, Stobbe accompanied her motion for interpleader with a copy of a proposed cross complaint. That may have been a convenience to all concerned, but the cross complaint could have no standing as a pleading in the action unless and until Donaldson was brought in as a party. In-terpleader was governed by secs. 260.19 and 260.20, Stats. 1955, which then made no provision for filing or service of pleadings against a party sought to be interpleaded, before the interpleader was actually ordered.\\nThus the only matter before the civil court when the motion for interpleader came on to be heard, was whether that motion should be granted and Donaldson made a party to the replevin action. The civil court, after listening to statements of counsel and examining “the pleadings therein” (the proposed cross complaint was not then a pleading in the action), and “various certified copies of documents used in connection with said sale,” denied the motion to interplead. Therefore Donaldson never became a party to the action and no claim was ever made against it in that action which the civil court could adjudicate.\\nStress is laid by appellant upon the allegation that the civil court’s order not only denied interpleader, but dismissed the proposed cross complaint on its merits. That portion of the order of the civil court must be treated as surplusage. The court had no authority to adjudicate claims against Donaldson Oldsmobile Company in an action in which that company was not a party, nor to dismiss on the merits a pleading which was merely a proposed pleading, to be effective only if and when the person pleaded against should be made a party to the action. Since the civil court’s purported adjudication of the merits of Stobbe’s claim against Donaldson was made in an action to which the company was not a party, and with respect to a pleading which had no standing in the action, the subject matter is not res adjudícala. Cf., Nehring v. Niemerowicz, 226 Wis. 285, 290-292, 276 N. W. 325.\\nAppellant argues, citing our decision in R. B. General Trucking v. Auto Parts & Service, 3 Wis. (2d) 91, 87 N. W. (2d) 863, that Donaldson’s appearance in the civil court in response to the order to show cause was a general appearance, and that therefore the civil court had jurisdiction over the persons of both Stobbe and Donaldson; that the civil court had jurisdiction of the subject matter of the cross complaint (a demand for money damages for fraud and negligence) ; and that therefore the purported dismissal of the proposed cross complaint on the merits was only erroneous, not void, and since it was not appealed from it stands as a final adjudication precluding consideration of the merits in the present action.\\nWe do not consider that R. B. General Trucking, supra, goes that far. In that case a corporation sought the equitable aid of the circuit court to restrain enforcement of a civil court judgment. The judgment had originally been rendered against an individual, but in a subsequent proceeding in which the corporation appeared generally, the circuit court had amended the judgment to name the corporation as a judgment debtor, though no pleading against it had been served or filed. The circuit court declined to grant relief from the judgment. We held that such denial of equitable relief was proper, since the corporation had a remedy by appeal from the civil court order which it had not exercised. No question of res adjudicata was involved. In R. B., the corporation was before the circuit court on the merits of the claim made against it; here Donaldson appeared only on the question of interpleader, and when that was denied the merits were not before the civil court for adjudication.\\nThe order denying interpleader was not appealable. Jones v. United States F. & G. Co. 210 Wis. 6, 8, 245 N. W. 650; Hartwig v. Harvey, 250 Wis. 478, 480, 27 N. W. (2d) 363. If Stobbe had tried to appeal from it she would have been met with that proposition, and it is doubtful, for the reasons above set forth, that this court would have entertained an appeal from that part of the order purporting to dismiss the proposed cross complaint.\\nBy the Court. — Order affirmed.\\nHallows, J., took no part.\\nCurrie, J., dissents.\\n1\\nSec. 260.19 (4), created by court rule effective September 1, 1956, now provides for service of a proposed cross complaint with the motion papers.',\n",

       "       'text': 'OPINION OF THE COURT\\nDianne T. Renwick, J.\\nPlaintiff Noel Bess commenced this tort action in Supreme Court, Bronx County, alleging labor law violations. The action was later transferred to Civil Court pursuant to CPLR 325 (d). Four years later, plaintiff moves for an order transferring the action back to Supreme Court. The dispositive issue is whether Supreme Court has the wherewithal to facilitate such a transfer at this stage of the proceedings for the reasons averred by movant plaintiff.\\nBackground\\nIn 1999, plaintiff Noel Bess commenced this tort action in New York State Supreme Court, Bronx County, seeking to recover money damages for personal injuries sustained on July 6, 1998, while doing construction/demolition work. Reportedly, before his accident, plaintiff had been removing metal beams and ceiling fans while standing on an elevated platform. The platform collapsed, causing plaintiff’s fall and injuries.\\nOn October 29, 1999, the justice presiding over the preliminary conference removed the case to Civil Court, by an order entered pursuant to CPLR 325 (d) and Uniform Rules for Trial Courts, without the consent of the parties. As reported by one of the parties opposing the motion (defendant), the transfer was triggered by the court’s assessment that plaintiff had sustained only “mild to moderate” injuries (“laceration of the lower lip, and vague allegations of pain and trauma”).\\nFour years later, plaintiff moves in Supreme Court for an order transferring the case back to Supreme Court. Plaintiff argues that Supreme Court initially erred in ordering a transfer to Civil Court based upon the incorrect assessment of the severity of the injuries that plaintiff had suffered. As reported in the bill of particulars, allegedly available to the court at the preliminary conference, plaintiff sustained “very serious injuries” in the nature of a “compression fracture, herniated disk at L4-L5, bulging disk at [L5]-S1, all with resulting pain, restriction, weakness and limitations.” In addition, plaintiff claims that the case has “languished” in Civil Court for four years with no real expectation of reaching trial anytime soon. Such inordinate delay, plaintiff argues, warrants the transfer of the case back to Supreme Court. Defendant and third-party defendant, on the other hand, argue that Supreme Court was divested of jurisdiction over the case once it was transferred to Civil Court.\\nDiscussion\\nUnder rules enacted on the authority of CPLR 325 (d), which implement article VI, § 19 (k) of the New York Constitution, various courts, notably the Supreme Court, can transfer a case down to a lower court. Uniform Rules for Trial Courts (22 NYCRR) § 202.12 (c) (4) and § 202.13 permit such a transfer from Supreme Court to New York City Civil Court. CPLR 325 (d) expands the monetary jurisdiction of the lower court for the cause of action so transferred to the ad damnum clause of such action. Thus, upon transfer, the lower court can grant a judgment in the case in the amount of the original demand in the higher court, even though it exceeds the regular monetary jurisdiction of the lower court. (See CPLR 325 [d].)\\nThe legislative purpose of enacting CPLR 325 (d) was to create a procedural device under which a higher court can freely transfer cases to lower courts of limited jurisdiction to reduce trial calendar congestion in Supreme Court. (Gordon v Board of Educ. of City of N.Y., 134 Misc 2d 284 [Civ Ct 1987]; see also, 74 Siegel’s Practice Review [Aug. 1998]; Siegel, NY Prac § 27 [2d ed].) “What was contemplated by the drafters of [CPLR § 325 (d)] was that the transfer-down power would be used only on cases at or reasonably near the monetary limit of the lower court in the area.” (74 Siegel’s Practice Review, at 1 [Aug. 1998].)\\nContrary to defendants’ suggestion, however, it was not the legislative intent that a transfer to Civil Court pursuant to CPLR 325 (d) would irrevocably divest the Supreme Court of jurisdiction over the transferred case. (See Huston v Rao, 74 AD2d 127 [2d Dept 1980].) For instance, an action may be removed from a lower court, like New York City Civil Court, where it appears that the court in which an action is pending does not have jurisdiction to grant the relief to which the particular plaintiff is entitled. (Huston v Rao, 74 AD2d 127 [2d Dept 1980].) For example, in Zuckermann v Spector (287 AD2d 402 [1st Dept 2001]), the appellate court ordered a retransfer to Supreme Court, where the declaratory relief sought by plaintiffs was not within the Civil Court’s subject matter jurisdiction. In Zuckermann, after the physicians discharged their attorney, he billed them for fees he claimed they had not paid. They sued him, seeking, inter alia, a declaration that he was discharged for cause and they owed him nothing. The appellate court held that since the physicians were seeking declaratory relief which could only be granted by a court of general jurisdiction, Supreme Court, the action had to be transferred back to such a court from the court of limited jurisdiction, Civil Court, to which it had been transferred earlier.\\nAnother circumstance where Supreme Court has been compelled to order a retransfer to the higher court is when the transfer to the lower court engenders substantial prejudice. (See e.g., La Placa v Boorstein, 87 Misc 2d 45 [Sup Ct, Queens County 1976]; Schwartz v New York City Tr. Auth., 104 AD2d 370 [2d Dept 1984]; but see, Pulerwitz v Rand, 141 AD2d 623 [2d Dept 1988].) For instance, in La Placa v Boorstein (supra), plaintiffs medical malpractice action, brought in Supreme Court, was removed to New York City Civil Court pursuant to CPLR 325 (d). The removal deprived plaintiff of the statutory right of a hearing before a medical malpractice panel, since such right is not available in Civil Court. (See Judiciary Law § 148.) Finding that plaintiff should not be denied such an important right, Supreme Court granted plaintiffs motion seeking to transfer the case back to Supreme Court. (La Placa v Boorstein, supra.)\\nCircumstances may also change subsequent to the transfer warranting a transfer back to Supreme Court. The classic example is when it appears that a plaintiffs recovery may reasonably exceed the amount stated in the ad damnum clause of her complaint. In such a situation, the Supreme Court would entertain a motion for a retransfer of the action to that court for the purpose of granting leave to increase the ad damnum clause. (See e.g., Huston v Rao, supra; Pulerwitz v Rand, 141 AD2d 623 [2d Dept 1988]; Mittman v International Menswear, 125 AD2d 377 [2d Dept 1986].) A motion to increase the ad damnum clause must be made in Supreme Court because Civil Court does not have the power to grant such relief. (See Francilion v Epstein, 144 AD2d 633, 633-634 [1988]; 1 Weinstein-Korn-Miller, NY Civ Prac 325.11; Siegel, NY Prac § 25 [2d ed]; but see, Southwell v New York City Tr. Auth., 96 Misc 2d 206 [Civ Ct 1978].)\\nNevertheless, absent the aforementioned extraordinary or compelling circumstances, a Supreme Court has no authority to facilitate a CPLR 325 (d) retransfer. (See, La Placa v Boorstein, supra; Schwartz v New York City Tr. Auth., supra; cf. Tobias v New York Hosp., 279 AD2d 374 [1st Dept 2001] [transfer not improper since plaintiff sustained no prejudice by it].) Indeed, pursuant to the foregoing statute, once an action has been transferred, “the fiction arises that the action was commenced in the transferee court initially * * * [and] [t]he transferor court is thus robbed of all further jurisdiction in the case, and cannot hear subsequent motions.” (Yuan Zhai v Chemical Bank, 180 Misc 2d 442, 445 [Civ Ct 1999], quoting McLaughlin, Practice Commentaries, McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 7B, CPLR C326:l, at 591; see, Mears v Chrysler Fin. Corp., 243 AD2d 270, 271 [1st Dept 1997] [once Supreme Court transfers an action to Civil Court, Supreme Court effectively “ ‘loses all further jurisdiction to act’ ” in the proceeding (citation omitted)]; Graham v New York City Hous. Auth., 224 AD2d 248 [1st Dept 1996] [“By virtue of the transfer of the action to the Civil Court, the Supreme Court was deprived of subject matter jurisdiction and had no authority to conduct any further proceedings with respect to this case”]; see also, Mather v Ginsroe, Inc., 45 Misc 2d 674 [Sup Ct 1965].)\\nIn this case, the court is not convinced that extraordinary or compelling circumstances exist to warrant a transfer of the case back to Supreme Court. To begin with, this is not the case where the possible recovery may exceed the amount stated in the ad damnum clause. Thus, there is no dispute that plaintiff can be adequately compensated for his injuries within the jurisdictional limits of the Civil Court as expanded by CPLR 325 (d). (Cf. Huston v Rao, supra; Pulerwitz v Rand, 141 AD2d 623 [2d Dept 1988]; Mittman v International Menswear, 125 AD2d 377 [2d Dept 1986].)\\nRather, as alluded to before, plaintiff argues that the original transfer was improper because the court failed to realize that the sustained injuries were severe enough to preclude a transfer under CPLR 325 (d). However, except where a party questions subject matter jurisdiction, which is never waived, a party’s remedy is to challenge the Supreme Court’s transfer order by way of reargument or by prescribed appellate procedure. (See, Zuckermann v Spector, 287 AD2d 402 [1st Dept 2001].) A Supreme Court order transferring a case down to Civil Court, pursuant to CPLR 325 (d), is an appealable order to the Appellate Division. (See Tobias v New York Hosp., 279 AD2d 374 [1st Dept 2001]; Samuels v Cauldwell-Wingate Co., 262 AD2d 178 [1st Dept 1999].) Thus, in light of plaintiffs dilatory conduct (four years) in making this motion, plaintiff has forfeited any right he had for review of the original determina tion, at the preliminary conference, transferring the action to Civil Court based on the assessment of the extent of the injuries as only “mild to moderate.”\\nNor is this court convinced that the circumstances of this case have significantly changed since then to warrant a transfer back to Supreme Court. Plaintiffs averment that the action has been languishing in Civil Court with no immediate prospect of reaching a trial is not an extraordinary or compelling reason for facilitating its transfer back to Supreme Court. Indeed, such a transfer with its attendant delays would not guarantee that plaintiff would reach a more expeditious adjudication in Supreme Court. On the contrary, the goals of judicial economy and efficiency could only be hampered, not furthered, by permitting a retransfer based solely on the fact of the delay in adjudication of the action in the lower court. Such a ruling would be an administrative nightmare; it would surely open a Pandora’s box, by encouraging parties to move for re-transfer whenever a party feels her case has not progressed at a satisfactory pace in Civil Court. Also, it would undoubtedly cause many cases to move full circle with the attendant unnecessary administrative cost.\\nConclusion\\nIn sum, this court rejects defendant’s and codefendant’s notion that Supreme Court is irrevocably divested of jurisdiction over a case that has been transferred to Civil Court, pursuant to CPLR 325 (d). Nevertheless, this court is not convinced that plaintiffs alleged predicament — his case languishing in Civil Court, presumably shared by other transferred cases — is a sufficient reason to facilitate its retransfer to Supreme Court, in light of the countervailing policy considerations mentioned above. Such considerations, along with the long delay in making this motion, require a denial of plaintiffs motion seeking an order transferring this action back to Supreme Court.\\n1\\n. The motion is also opposed by third-party defendant Long DeLosa Construction Group, which was not part of the action when the preliminary conference occurred on October 29, 1999.\\n2\\n. CPLR 325 (d) provides that “a court in which an action is pending may, in its discretion, remove such action without consent to such lower court where it appears that the amount of damages may be less than demanded, and the lower court would have had jurisdiction but for the amount of damages demanded.”',\n",

G. L. of 1927, and the circuit court though its judgment was voidable, approved that decision, apparently relying on Bank of Greenwood v. Rawles, et al., 117 Fla. 381, 158 So. 173.\\nThis was an incorrect construction of Section 7066, C. G. L. of 1927, as it was of the case last cited if relied on. Section 7066 C. G. L. of 1927, exempts the cash surrender values of life insurance policies from attachment, garnishment or other legal process in favor of creditors. Disability income benefits are provided under separate contract from cash surrender values and the one is no part of the latter. Disability income benefits inure to the insured in his lifetime, while cash surrender values inure at death or under conditions stated to the insured or to his devisees, legatees or heirs. In the law of insurance disability income benefits and cash surrender values are clearly distinguishable, operate on separate and well defined subjects and there is nothing whatever in Section 7066 C. G. L. of 1927 to indicate that it intended to reach disability income benefits.\\nRespondent relies on Bank of Greenwood v. Rawls, 117 Fla. 381; 158 So. 173, to counter this position. We have not overlooked this' case in reaching our conclusion,, but we think it is clearly distinguishable from the case at bar. There was no inherent right to have the proceeds of life insurance exempted, and the statute relied on does not in terms reach disability benefits and in the Rawls case the policy was settled and discharged and the beneficiaries cut off.\\nIt follows that disability income benefits are not exempt from execution by Section 7066 C. G. L. of 1927 when the life insurance features are not surrendered. Legg v. St. John Truster, 296 U. S. 489; 80 L.

The appellant’s complaint was filed before the appellees’ complaint. The subject matter of the two suits was the same. In the civil court of record action the appellant contended that because of a forfeiture of a ninety-nine year lease, he was entitled to possession of real property on which a motel had been built. The appellees’ complaint alleged that the lease was valid and subsisting and prayed for a declaration to that effect. The complaint did not allege that the civil court of record suit had been filed but alleged simply that the landlord had declared the lease in default and had threatened legal proceedings. There is nothing in the record to show that at the time the appellees filed their complaint they knew that a complaint had been filed in the civil court of record. The appel-lees’ petition for injunction, filed six days after the complaint, alleges that the appel-lees have no adequate remedy except in a court of equity. The circuit court entered an order which temporarily enjoined prosecution of the unlawful detainer action in the civil court of record.\\nThe appellant did not immediately file his notice of appeal from the order entering the temporary injunction. He proceeded in the circuit court by filing an answer and counterclaim, by praying for the appointment of a receiver for the property involved, and by praying the court to im-plead a third party. The circuit court refused to appoint a receiver but did order the third party to be impleaded. Thereafter, the appellant filed his notice of appeal from the order granting the temporary restraining order.\\nThe appellant presents us with the following points:\\n“THE CIRCUIT COURT ERRED IN RESTRAINING THE PROSECUTION OF AN UNLAWFUL DETAINER ACTION FILED BY THE APPELLANT, GOSTA TOLLIUS, AGAINST THE APPELLEES IN THE CIVIL COURT OF RECORD.”\\n******\\n“THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN THE ENTRY OF A TEMPORARY INJUNCTION RESTRAINING THE PROCEEDINGS IN THE CIVIL COURT OF RECORD WHERE THE APPELLEES HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY PAID ALL COSTS.”\\nIn his argument under the first point, the appellant urges that the circuit court should have dismissed the appellees’ complaint because all the issues sought to be determined by that complaint could have been fully determined in the unlawful de-tainer action in the civil court of record. See Town of Palm Beach v. Gottesman, 152 Fla. 182, 11 So.2d 337 (1943).\\nUnlawful detainer is a statutory remedy of ancient origin. Crandall, Florida Common Law Practice, § 340 (1928). It is an expeditious remedy in which the main issue is the right to immediate possession. Chapter 82, Fla.Stat., F.S.A.; Goldring v. Reid, 61 Fla. 250, 54 So. 718 (1911). It is clearly unsuitable for the determination of equitable defenses because a judgment in such a suit is not a bar to a subsequent suit in equity. Stuart v. Hatch, 108 Fla. 443, 146 So. 557 (1933). We therefore conclude that under the circumstances of this case the circuit court did not err in following the well established rule that where the complainant shows himself entitled to some purely equitable relief an injunction may be granted to restrain pending or threatenéd actions at law concerning the same subject matter. Pep ple v. Rogers, 104 Fla. 462, 140 So. 205 (1932). We have considered the appellant’s other objections to the complaint and find that they are inapplicable.\\nThe appellant’s second point directed to the failure of the circuit court to require the appellees to pay the costs in the civil court of record does not demonstrate error because there is no showing that this matter was raised in the circuit court.\\nAffirmed.\\nHENDRY, J., dissents.',\n",

       "       'text': 'OPINION OF THE COURT\\nLouise Gruner Gans, J.\\nMay an action to recover assets transferred in violation of the Bulk Sales Act (UCC art 6), or an action to recover assets fraudulently transferred in derogation of the rights of creditors, pursuant to article 10 of the Debtor and Creditor Law, be maintained against the transferee of the assets in the Civil Court of the City of New York?\\nThe court holds that each such action is a species of action for rescission which, pursuant to CCA 213, may be maintained in the Civil Court of the City of New York, as long as the amount in controversy does not exceed $25,000.\\nPlaintiff Talbot Typographies, Inc. (Talbot), commenced this action in the Civil Court of the City of New York against defendants Tenba, Inc. (Tenba) and Quality Cases, Ltd. (Quality), for moneys due and owing to plaintiff Talbot for services and materials Talbot had provided pursuant to a contract with defendant Tenba. The complaint states eight causes of action, of which the first five are based on claims for breach of contract, account stated, unjust enrichment, quantum meruit, and a claim for legal fees due under the contract. Plaintiff’s sixth, seventh and eighth causes of action are the subject of this decision.\\nPlaintiff’s sixth and seventh causes of action seek to recover a judgment against defendant Quality Cases, Ltd. under the Bulk Sales Act (UCC art 6). According to the complaint, in December 1988, after plaintiff Talbot’s claim against Tenba had already accrued, defendant Tenba, Inc., on the one hand informed Talbot that it was unable to pay its debts, and on the other hand transferred its assets, including stock in trade, accounts receivable and good will, to defendant Quality Cases, Ltd. Based on these facts, the sixth cause of action alleges that the transfer of the assets of Tenba, Inc., without prior notice to creditors as required by UCC 6-102, 6-105, 6-107, must be treated as ineffective against plaintiff Talbot. The seventh cause of action likewise seeks to have the transfer of assets to Quality declared ineffective as against Talbot, based on Tenba’s failure to provide Quality with a complete list of its creditors and with an accurate accounting of amounts owed by Tenba to such creditors as required by UCC 6-104.\\nThe eighth cause of action seeks to set aside the transfer of assets by Tenba to Quality as an allegedly fraudulent conveyance, pursuant to article 10 of the Debtor and Creditor Law, including Debtor and Creditor Law § 278. The monetary amount claimed by plaintiff on any of its causes of action does not exceed $12,000.\\nDefendants Tenba and Quality have moved pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (2) to dismiss plaintiff’s sixth, seventh and eighth causes of action, alleging that these are claims in equity over which the Civil Court of the City of New York lacks subject matter jurisdiction.\\nDefendants’ argument would have been correct, had it been made prior to 1980. Prior to 1980, H. L. C. Imports v M & L Siegel, Inc. (98 Misc 2d 179 [Civ Ct, NY County 1979]), had held that an action against the transferee in a bulk sale without notice could not be maintained in the Civil Court for lack of the requisite equity jurisdiction. Likewise, Circulation Assocs. v Mother’s Manual (53 Misc 2d 225 [Civ Ct, NY County 1967]), held that the Civil Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction of an action to set aside a fraudulent conveyance under article 10 of the Debtor and Creditor Law. The action was held to be equitable in nature, and, therefore, outside the powers of the Civil Court, despite the fact that it had ostensibly been brought for money damages. Krauss v Dinerstein (62 Misc 2d 682 [Civ Ct, NY County 1970]), followed the holding and the reasoning of Circulation Assocs. v Mother’s Manual (supra), on the same point.\\nAlthough prior to 1980, the Civil Court had been granted equity powers in specifically prescribed circumstances (CCA 208 [c] [1]; 209, 212), its exercise of jurisdiction over actions for rescission and reformation was limited to counterclaims for such relief by CCA 208 (c) (1). In 1980 CCA 213 was enacted, reading as follows: \"The [civil] court shall have jurisdiction of actions for rescission or reformation of a transaction if the amount in controversy does not exceed ten thousand dollars” (L 1980, ch 587, § 1). In 1984 section 213 was amended to raise the required \"amount in controversy” to $25,000 (L 1984, ch 11, § 9). The self-evident purpose of the legislation was that \"If the [civil] court can provide relief in the nature of rescission or reformation on a counterclaim, it should be able to entertain an action requesting such relief by a plaintiff.” (1980 NY Legis Ann, at 245.)\\nA creditor’s action to set aside transfers and follow assets of a corporate debtor pursuant to article 10, section 278 of the Debtor and Creditor Law, such as plaintiff Talbot asserts in its eighth cause of action, has long been characterized as an action in equity for rescission. (Hearn 45 St. Corp. v Jano, 283 NY 139 [1940].) Explaining its holding that the action was one for rescission, the Court of Appeals stated, \"The gravamen of the action is the right of the creditor to be paid out of assets to which he is actually entitled and to set aside the indicia of ownership which apparently contradict that right.” (Hearn 45 St. Corp. v Jano, supra, at 143.) This characterization of actions for rescission applies equally to actions under the Bulk Sales Act to declare a transfer of assets \"ineffective”. (UCC 6-104, 6-105, 6-107.)\\nThe only post-1980 authority cited by defendants is St. Johnland Nursing Home v Perlman (134 Misc 2d 1048 [Suffolk County Ct 1987]) which held that the County Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to set aside a fraudulent conveyance under Debtor and Creditor Law § 279. The decision relies on the New York State constitutional provisions (art VI, § 11 [b]), defining and limiting the powers of the County Courts. The powers of the Civil Court are derived from NY Constitution, article VI, § 15. For that reason, the St. Johnland case is neither binding nor persuasive authority as to the jurisdiction of the Civil Court. More closely on point and supportive of this court’s decision is Mark v William Muschel, Inc. (135 Misc 2d 804 [Civ Ct, NY County]) which held that CCA 213 granted to the Civil Court the power to order the rescission of a lease at the instance of a party plaintiff, where previously that relief could only be granted pursuant to an equitable defense.\\nAccordingly, plaintiff’s sixth, seventh and eighth causes of action, while being equitable claims for rescission, may nevertheless be maintained in the Civil Court pursuant to CCA 213, since the amount in controversy is less than $25,000. Defendants’ motion to dismiss these causes of action is denied. Plaintiff’s cross motion to amend the caption of this action to reflect changes in the names of both corporate defendants is not opposed by said defendants and is granted.',\n",

       "       'text': '&emdash;Separate judgments, entered in New York County on June 13, 1978, modified, on the law, to provide that interest on Action No. 1 shall be computed from April 23, 1975 and that interest on Action No. 2 shall be computed from September 14, 1974 and, except, as so modified, affirmed without costs. Appeal from orders, entered November 22, 1977, denying joint trials of these two actions with two actions in the Civil Court, New York County, dismissed upon the ground that these orders did not necessarily affect the final judgment. Plaintiffs in these two actions are bound together by substantially the same ownership and by common business interests. Each is engaged in the manufacture of knitted fabrics. Defendants are, likewise, sister corporations which, prior to their liquidation, were engaged in the business of bonding and laminating fabrics for manufacturers. Beginning in 1971, defendants were utilized by plaintiffs to bond and laminate plaintiffs’ knitted fabrics. Differences arose between the parties involving delays and errors in shipment. In November, 1974, after the business relations between them had cooled considerably, plaintiffs notified defendants that they would not make further payments to them unless and until these disputes were settled. Shortly prior thereto, defendants, which theretofore had warehoused plaintiffs’ goods without cost pending shipment, notified plaintiffs that commencing November 1, 1974 they would impose a charge for such storage. In October, 1975, defendants notified plaintiffs that, pursuant to the provisions of the Lien Law, they claimed a lien upon plaintiffs’ merchandise in their warehouse and that such merchandise would be sold at public auction on November 17, 1975 to satisfy the lien. Thereupon, plaintiffs brought these actions for injunctions. Their separate motions for temporary injunctions were granted upon condition that security in the aggregate amount of $40,000 was posted. The condition was complied with and thereafter plaintiffs removed their property from defendants’ warehouse. Defendants interposed their separate answers each of which contained two counterclaims; one for work, labor and services and the other for storage charges. At or about the same time, defendants brought actions against plaintiffs in the Civil Court for other services alleged to have been performed by them for plaintiffs. However, in those actions, the parties were somewhat different. There, Lincoln Laminating made claim against Princeton while the claim of Lincoln Processing was asserted against Fonda. Issue was joined in May, 1976. Almost two years later, defendants in the Civil Court actions (the plaintiffs here) amended their answers to assert counterclaims based on the contention that the work performed by plaintiffs (the defendants here) had been defective. In the interim, the Supreme Court actions were pursued vigorously while little or nothing was done to move the Civil Court suits to trial. Thereafter, plaintiffs moved for a joint trial of the Civil Court actions with the Supreme Court actions. That motion was heard by the Trial Judge and was denied without opinion. Some three or four months later, the Supreme Court actions went to trial. Inasmuch as the plaintiffs had already reclaimed their merchandise, all that was tried were the counterclaims interposed by defendants. The trial resulted in a judgment for each of the defendants on the claim for work, labor and services and a dismissal of the claim for storage charges. We treat first with so much of plaintiffs’ appeals as seeks to review the orders denying the motions for a joint trial of the Supreme Court and Civil Court actions. Once \"final judgment is entered, an appeal from the final judgment is the only method for reviewing an intermediate order. The right to a separate appeal from the intermediate order does not survive the entry of the final judgment” (Jema Props. v McLeod, 51 AD2d 702). Inasmuch as the orders denying a joint trial do not necessarily affect the final judgment, they may not be reviewed upon appeal from the final judgment (CPLR 5501, subd [a], par 1; Dayon v Downe Communications, 42 AD2d 889). Accordingly, the appeals from those orders must be dismissed. Insofar as concerns the appeals and cross appeals from the judgments, we hold that the conclusion of Trial Term that defendants were entitled to recover for work, labor and services, but not entitled to recover on the claim for storage charges, is amply supported by the proof. However, we are constrained to modify the judgments in one respect. CPLR 5001 (subd [b]) provides for interest \"from the earliest ascertainable date the cause of action existed”. The last invoice issued to Fonda is for services rendered between May 7, 1974 and March 24, 1975. The last invoice issued to Princeton is dated August 15, 1974. The form invoice indicates that the terms of payment are \"net 30 days”. Accordingly, the defendants are entitled to interest on the Fonda judgment from April 23, 1975 and on the Princeton judgment from September 14, 1974. One further matter remains for disposition. Plaintiffs have requested that, inasmuch as defendants have been liquidated, we stay enforcement of the judgments pending disposition of their counterclaims in the Civil Court actions. The Civil Court actions were commenced in 1976. More than three years have elapsed since the joinder of issue. Had these claims been pursued diligently, they would have been disposed of long ago. However, substantially nothing has been done to move them to disposition, although we are told that they remain viable. In the circumstances, the plea that this court invoke its equity power to give aid to the dilatory merits little consideration. The requested relief is denied. Concur—Fein, J. P., Bloom, Silverman and Ross, JJ.',\n",

       "       'text': 'Markewich, J.,\\ndissents in part in a memorandum as follows: I concur in the main with the position taken by the majority. However, I do not believe that justice is served by outright denial, as stated in the last paragraph of the prevailing memorandum, of Fonda-Princeton’s application for stay of enforcement of the judgments pending disposition of their counterclaims interposed in the Civil Court action commenced in 1975. The delay in prosecuting those counterclaims has a rational basis and should not be used as a reason for putting the Fonda parties completely out of court. Their counterclaims have not been shown to be other than meritorious. The Supreme Court action here reviewed was commenced by plaintiffs Fonda and Princeton in November, 1975. About seven weeks later, simultaneously with service of their answers, the Lincoln defendants commenced actions, based on the same relationships reflected in the other case, in Civil Court; the Fonda parties interposed counterclaims. The Lincoln parties did nothing about the actions they had commenced, but the Fonda parties moved forthwith for consolidation. That motion was denied and the appeal therefrom dismissed on this appeal. Neither party did anything then to advance the Civil Court case, but concentrated on the more important action in Supreme Court. It was not possible at that time for Fonda-Princeton to proceed independently on their counterclaims because requisite information was apparently not available then. The Supreme Court actions terminated by judgments in June, 1978, and, logically enough (it is noted that both judgments have here been modified), nothing was done about the Civil Court actions while this appeal awaited decision. Meanwhile, the Civil Court actions continue to be alive, and the Fonda parties desire to prosecute their counterclaims which, if successful, would at least permit offset to the judgments. The practical factor which dictates that discretion be exercised to permit this is that the Lincoln parties are now out of business, have been liquidated, and are beyond successful levy. While this court is without jurisdiction to dismiss the counterclaims in the Civil Court actions, it will, in terms of ultimate relief be doing so by the majority’s ruling made on the sole basis that the Fonda parties have been dilatory. They have not. In my view, we should grant the application for a stay for the limited period of six months to permit completion of the matters pending in Civil Court. Settle order.',\n",

A nonpayment proceeding based on the 1981 lease was instituted by defendant against plaintiff in the Civil Court of the City of New York in September, 1981. Plaintiff’s motion now before the court is to remove that proceeding to this court and consolidate it with said declaratory judgment action. The theory behind the request is that the Civil Court cannot provide complete relief because it allegedly does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate plaintiff’s affirmative defense that the 1981 lease is not binding because it was executed under unlawful duress.\\nFACTS\\nA final judgment of possession in a prior nonpayment proceeding was obtained on default by defendant as landlord against plaintiff as tenant in the Civil Court on June 26, 1981. Plaintiff states that when it received a 72-hour notice of eviction pursuant to that judgment it contacted defendant who agreed that if payment of back due rent by certified check was made by July 16, eviction would not ensue. The complaint states that instead of honoring such agreement, defendant locked plaintiff out of the premises prior to the expiration of the 72-hour period, but a day or two later agreed to grant plaintiff a new lease at a rent three times the existing rental. Plaintiff acknowledges that it signed such new lease, but claims that it did so under the duress of being deprived of its premises which it needed immediately for its weekend business. No explanation is offered as to why it did not employ the common procedure of procuring an order of the Civil Court staying eviction pending a hearing on alleged improper service.\\nSince plaintiff refused to pay the higher rental, in September the landlord commenced the pending nonpayment proceeding and plaintiff asserted the aforesaid affirmative defense. Plaintiff then instituted the instant action.\\nISSUE PRESENTED\\nThe issue raised by this motion is whether the Civil Court has jurisdiction to determine on the merits whether the 1981 lease is enforceable in light of the alleged unlawful duress. If so; that court can resolve all of the relevant issues between the parties in that proceeding with the result that there would be no need for removal.\\nRELEVANT STATUTES\\nSection 208 (subd [c], par 1) of the New York City Civil Court Act grants the Civil Court jurisdiction of a counterclaim for rescission or reformation “if the amount in controversy on such counterclaim does not exceed $10,000”. Here the monthly rental under the 1981 lease is over $5,000. Thus, the lease rental involved is well over the jurisdictional limit of the section.\\nSection 212-a of the Civil Court Act gives the court jurisdiction of an action for a declaratory judgment but only with respect to controversies relating to an obligation of an insurer to indemnify or defend a defendant.\\nSection 905 of the Civil Court Act allows the court to consider any defense to a claim whether it be “deemed legal or equitable in nature.”\\nIn a summary proceeding, over which the Civil Court has jurisdiction (CCA, § 204), RPAPL 743 provides that an answer “may contain any legal or equitable defense, or counterclaim.”\\nRPAPL 747 (subd 1) states that the court in a summary proceeding “shall direct that a final judgment be entered determining the rights of the parties.” Subdivision 2 of the section provides that the final judgment “shall not bar an action, proceeding or counterclaim, commenced or interposed within sixty days of entry of the judgment, for affirmative equitable relief which was not sought by counterclaim in the proceeding because of the limited jurisdiction of the court.”\\nANALYSIS\\nThe concept of a party being able to assert equitable defenses and counterclaims in a summary proceeding has been in the law since before the turn of the century. However, such a defense in courts not having general equity power has consistently been held to be usable only as a “shield and not as a sword”, with the result that the defense may be used to defeat a proceeding but not as a basis for obtaining affirmative relief. (See, e.g., Bien v Bixby, 18 Misc 415; Great Park Corp. v Goldberger, 41 Misc 2d 988.) In the latter case (41 Misc 2d 988, 989, supra) the court stated that “any equitable defense offered by the tenant to show that the landlord is not entitled to such possession must be considered.”\\nIn Magnotta v Parkway Fleetwood Bldg. (277 App Div 896) a denial of a motion to dismiss a Supreme Court declaratory judgment action was reversed because the court found that the relief sought in such action was obtainable by way of defense in a pending summary proceeding.\\nIn Lun Far Co. v Aylesbury Assoc. (40 AD2d 794) it was ruled that since the “Civil Court has jurisdiction of the tenant’s defense based on so-called reformation grounded on an executed oral modification of the lease provisions for termination at the landlord’s option”, removal was not appropriate. (See, also, Childress v Lipkis, 72 AD2d 724, app dsmd 48 NY2d 975.)\\nFrom the statutes and authorities cited it is clear that plaintiff can raise the defense of duress when the landlord seeks to enforce the 1981 lease. If the defense is sustained, the landlord would be unable to enforce that lease. The question before the Civil Court would then be whether the 1978 lease was effectively terminated. In deciding that issue the court would deal with all of the issues raised by the tenant, including improper service.\\nWhat then would be the status of the 1981 lease? Although the Civil Court cannot render a judgment declaring it rescinded, that for all practical purposes would be the effect of a ruling sustaining such defense. True, if plaintiff desires a court judgment declaring the 1981 lease rescinded, it would have to continue this action. But, if it obtained such a ruling on duress, under the concept of res judicata it could obtain summary judgment in this court.\\nIn opposition to the above analysis, plaintiff cites Hotel New Yorker Pharmacy v New Yorker Hotel Corp. (40 AD2d 967). There the tenant sued in Supreme Court for an injunction to prohibit the landlord and the former landlord from interfering with its pharmacy business. The landlord counterclaimed for rent. Three months later the landlord instituted a nonpayment proceeding for the same relief sought in the counterclaim, which proceeding was, on tenant’s motion, removed to the Supreme Court. The fact pattern is obviously different. There is no defense the tenant could raise in the Civil Court that would result in its obtaining the relief sought. Also different, was the fact that the summary proceeding was commenced several months after the injunction action and that the tenant was requesting relief in addition against the former landlord who was not a party to the summary proceeding.\\nBarak v 28 E. 6262 Realty Corp. (70 AD2d 543), which also granted removal, is also distinguishable as there the tenant was seeking specific performance of a contract to purchase a condominium, which relief could not be obtained by counterclaim in the subsequently instituted nonpayment proceeding.\\nLastly, in the case at bar, it is expected that the summary proceeding will be heard promptly after this motion is decided. As stated in Lun Far Co. v Aylesbury Assoc. (supra, p 794) “a prompt and expeditious determination may be had” in the Civil Court and the “ends of justice are always promoted by the speedy trial of an action.”\\nAs a postscript, the court notes that in the cases cited and in the case at bar, litigants and Judges have spent much time and effort in resolving issues that arise from the differing jurisdiction of various courts. Such problems would be eliminated if court consolidation, as proposed by the Governor and Chief Judge Cooke, were adopted.\\nMotion denied.',\n",

The writ of error was sued out on April 23, 1937.\\nThe writ of error was dismissed. in the circuit court because in its suing out the provisions of Section 3 of Chápter 15666, Acts of 1931, were not- complied with in that the writ of error was sued out more than thirty days after the entry of the judgment to which it was addressed without the judge of the civil court of record or either of the judges of the appellate court having made an order extending the time within which such writ of error could be sued out.\\nSections 1, 2 and 3 of Chapter 15666, Acts of 1931, are as follows:\\n“Section 1. The circuit court of any county in this State in which there shall be established and existing a civil court of record under and pursuant to Chapter 11357, Laws of Florida, approved November 30, 1925, shall have final appellate jurisdiction in all civil cases arising in such civil court of record.\\n“Section 2. All proceedings in the circuit court to review any final judgment rendered in or by such civil court of record, shall be by writ of error, issued out of any (sic) by said circuit court and directed to said civil court of record.\\n“Section 3. All such writs of error shall be tested in the name of the judge or judges of said appellate court, as the case may be, and shall issue on dernand as a matter of right, from the office of the clerk of said appellate court or from that of the clerk of said civil court of record, and shall be sued out not later than thirty days after the entry of the final judgment sought to be reviewed, and shall be made returnable to said appellate court not more than forty days after the date of the writ; provided, that the judge of said civil court of record or either of the judges of said appellate court shall have power on good cause shown, to extend the time within which said writ of error may be sued out or made returnable; and provided further that no dismissal shall be had on account of such writ having been made returnable on a legal holiday or Sunday.”\\nChapter 11357, Extraordinary Session of 1925, established civil courts of record in all counties in Florida having a population of 100,000 inhabitants according to the last State census, and which said counties at that time had no civil court of record established.\\nIn the case of State of Florida ex rel. Rifas v. Atkinson, et al., 102 Fla. 1028, 137 Sou. 266, we said:\\n‘‘The Civil Court of Record which exists in Dade County is provided for by Chapter .11357, Acts of 1925, Special Session Laws, approved November 20, 1925. The object of Chapter 15666, Acts of 1931, supra, is to provide for and regulate writs of error from the circuit courts to those civil courts of record in this State which are organized and exist under said Chapter 11357, Acts of 1925, and to provide a special mode for hearing, consideration and disposition in the Circuit Court of writs of error so provided for. Section 2 of Chapter 15666 expressly provides that all proceedings in the circuit court to review any final judgment rendered in or by any such civil court of record shall be by writ of error. Apparently this is intended to be the exclusive method of review with reference to matters falling within the purview of the 1931 Act, but this question need not be decided at this time. Viewed comprehensively, the Act in its entirety appears to set up a new and distinct method of review by the civil court of judgments rendered in the civil courts of record organized under Chapter 113577 supra.”\\nAnother phase of Chapter 15666, Acts of 1931 was before this Court in the case of Grodin v. Railway Express Agency, 116 Fla. 378, 156 Sou. 476, and in State ex rel. v. Barns, et al., 119 Fla. 405, 161 Sou. 568, but the two latter cases have no bearing upon the question presented in this case. The title of that.Act is: “An Act Providing for and Regulating AVrits of Error from the Circuit Courts to Those Civil Courts of Record in This State Organized and Existing Under Chapter 11357 of the Laws of Florida, Approved November 30, 1925, and for the Hearing, Consideration and Disposition of the Same.”\\nTherefore, it is apparent that the provision of Section 3 regulating writs of error “shall be sued out not later than thirty days after the entry of the final judgment sought to be reviewed” is within the purview of the title of the Act.\\nIt has ever been recognized that it is competent for the Legislature to prescribe the time within which writs of error should be sued out .after judgment. See State v. Walker, 32 Fla. 431, 13 Sou. 928; Summerlin v. Tyler, et ux., 6 Fla. 718; A. C. L. Ry. Co. v. Holliday, 73 Fla. 269; 74 So. 479; McClellan v. Wood, 78 Fla. 407; 83 Sou. 295; Simmons v. Hanne, 50 Fla. 267, 39 Sou. 77; Eaton v. McCaskill, 53 Fla. 513, 43 Sou. 447; Fitzpatrick v. Turner, 14 Fla. 382, Hull v. Westcott, 17 Fla. 280; Benbow v. Marquis & Co., 17 Fla. 236; City of Orlando v. Hewitt, 92 Fla. 933, 110 Sou. 874.\\nProceedings to review judgments of civil courts of record are controlled by Chapter 15666, Acts of 1931 (Extra Session), same being Section 5168, (1) to (14) inclusive, Volume 4, Permanent Supplement, Compiled General Laws of 1927. This Act gives the circuit court in any county where a civil court of record is created final appellate jurisdiction in all cases arising in the latter courts. It defines in detail the manner in which such cases shall be reviewed, how the circuit court shall be organized as an appellate court and the manner of handling and disposing of cases brought to it as an appellate court. Section 3 of said Act provides that' writs of error to review judgments of the civil court of record by the circuit court “shall be sued out not later than thirty days after the entry of the final judgment sought to be reviewed,” unless the judge, for good cause shown, shall extend the time.\\nSection 1 of Article V, Constitution of Florida, authorizes the Legislature to set up other courts and commissions than those in terms designated therein. It was, therefore, competent for the Legislature to create appellate courts composed of circuit judges to review judgments of the civil court of record and to provide the procedure for such review. The procedure required must be substantially followed; otherwise, their judgments will be devoid of force or effect and by the terms of the Act, the judgment of the civil court of record is automatically affirmed.\\nChapter 15666, supra, does not appear to violate Section 1 of the Declaration of Rights, nor Section 4 of the Declaration of Rights, nor Section 20 or 21 of Article III of the Constitution.\\nOn authority of the opinion and judgment in the case of The Western Casualty & Surety Company v.

On November 17, 1955, plaintiff reduced the note to judgment by cognovit in the civil court of Milwaukee county. Plaintiff gave notice of the entry of judgment to defendant on June 27, 1956. On November 30, 1956, defendant moved the civil court to vacate the judgment and permit defendant to answer. The civil court denied the motion on February 8, 1957, and on February 20, 1957, defendant appealed from that order to the circuit court. The circuit court affirmed the civil court’s order on July 25, 1957.\\nWhile the appeal was pending in circuit court, on February 28, 1957, defendant moved the civil court the second time for an order opening the judgment for new reasons and permitting an amended answer setting forth new grounds of defense. The record does not disclose the disposition of that motion but it is obvious that the civil court had no jurisdiction over it while the record was up on appeal in the circuit court. On October 17, 1957, after the circuit court on July 25, 1957, had affirmed the order of February 8, 1957, defendant made a third motion to reopen the judgment and serve an amended answer. The civil court denied this motion on February 4, 1958, and appeal was taken to the circuit court. This civil court order was affirmed by the circuit court by order on April 28, 1958. The present appeal to us is from that order of affirmance. The only question before us is whether under the circumstances the civil court (and, on review, the circuit court) could grant relief from the judgment when more than a year after notice of judgment had elapsed.\\nThe case is controlled by sec. 269.46 (1), Stats.:\\n“Relief from judgments, orders, and stipulations; review of judgments and orders. (1) The court may, upon notice and just terms, at any time within one year after notice thereof, relieve a party from a judgment, order, stipulation, or other proceeding against him obtained, through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect and may supply an omission in any proceeding.”\\nDefendant had notice of the judgment on June 27, 1956. By statute, then, this relief cannot be granted after the expiration of one year from that time. State ex rel. Hall v. Cowie (1951), 259 Wis. 123, 128, 47 N. W. (2d) 309. Defendant urges us to toll the statute because he used up his time in appeal from the court which, timely made, had jurisdiction to give him relief. We have found no authority for that proposition. The statute makes no provision for enlargement of the time specified and the circuit court correctly conformed to the statutory limitation.\\nBy the Court. — Order affirmed.',\n",

       "       'text': 'OPINION OF THE COURT\\nMichael D. Stallman, J.\\nThis motion to dismiss raises unusual questions relating to the Civil Court’s territorial jurisdiction, the Supreme Court’s transfer power and the doctrine of direct estoppel.\\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\\nPlaintiff, an attorney, sues defendant, an indefinitely suspended attorney, for $3,147.99 on various theories arising from an alleged independent contractor agreement. Defendant asserts that the Civil Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction.\\nIn 1988, plaintiff commenced a prior action against the corporate defendant in Civil Court, New York County on the same claim. Defendant moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, asserting that all dealings occurred in Westchester County, outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Civil Court. After a hearing, the court found that defendant lacked the necessary relationship to New York City. (Spinnell v Doris L. Sassower, P. C., Civ Ct, NY County, Oct. 4, 1988, Arber, J. [docket No. 01236188].) The court dismissed with leave to sue in a proper jurisdiction.\\nApproximately six months later, plaintiff commenced this action in Supreme Court, New York County on the same claim. Apparently during routine screening, the Supreme Court transferred it to Civil Court pursuant to CPLR 325 (d), presumably since the ad damnum was under $25,000.\\nTen months later, this case first appeared on the Civil Court Trial I Calendar. Defendant served this motion on November 18, 1991; it was repeatedly adjourned in Special Term, Part I until submission.\\nThis court must resolve three issues: First, is the Supreme Court empowered under CPLR 325 (d) to transfer to Civil Court an action over which the Civil Court lacks territorial jurisdiction? Can a defendant waive this jurisdictional defect, and was it waived in the case at bar? Finally, what can the Civil Court appropriately do regarding an action mistakenly transferred by the Supreme Court?\\nA. Transfer Power of the Supreme Court Under CPLR 325 (d)\\nCPLR 325 (d) authorizes the adoption of court rules that empower a court to transfer a pending action, without the parties’ consent, to a lower court that has jurisdiction except for the amount demanded. (CPLR 325 [d]; see, NY Const, art VI, § 19 [k] [enabling provision].) After transfer, the lower court can award up to the ad damnum. Rules have been promulgated that authorize the Supreme Court within New York City to transfer such actions to the Civil Court. (22 NYCRR 202.13.) CPLR 325 (d) authorizes transfer to the lower court only if the lower court has both personal jurisdiction and subject matter jurisdiction other than monetary jurisdic tian; a case may not be transferred solely because the dollar amount sought is within the lower court’s jurisdictional limit. (See, McLaughlin, Practice Commentaries, McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 7B, CPLR C325:4, at 565.)\\nConversely, the Civil Court will not automatically have, or derivatively acquire, jurisdiction upon transfer simply because the Supreme Court had jurisdiction when the action was commenced there. (See, Hyman & Gilbert v Greenstein, 138 AD2d 678.) To argue that the Supreme Court transfer order transfers the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction, in addition to the action, not only violates the statute, it is conceptually unsound. It ignores the clear limiting language of CPLR 325 (d): \"and the lower court would have had jurisdiction but for the amount * * * demanded” (emphasis added). Moreover, no court, not even a superior court of general jurisdiction (e.g., the Supreme Court), is empowered to delegate or transfer its jurisdiction to another court.\\nA plain reading of CPLR 325 (d) reveals that the Legislature intended that the transferee lower court have both subject matter and personal jurisdiction. The Legislature did not attach any limiting adjectives to the word \"jurisdiction.” CPLR 325 (d) thus expands only the monetary jurisdiction of the lower court, only for the case so transferred. The words \"but for the amount of damages demanded” are the only words of limitation. They thus require that the lower court already have such subject matter and personal jurisdiction as would have permitted the transferred action to have been brought there originally, if the amount in controversy had been below the lower court’s monetary ceiling. (See, Friedman v Strand, 203 Misc 170 [Levy, J.] [pre-CPLR].)\\nB. Subject Matter Jurisdiction of the Civil Court\\nThe Civil Court has subject matter jurisdiction over causes of action for the recovery of money which do not exceed $25,000. (See, NY Const, art VI, § 15; CCA 202.) The basis of this motion, viz., the statutory requirement that the litigation have a geographical nexus with the City of New York, does not relate to the Civil Court’s subject matter jurisdiction. (See, CCA 404, and discussion infra.) Thus, the Civil Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action; defendant’s motion to dismiss on this ground is denied.\\nC. Territorial Jurisdiction of the Civil Court\\nCCA 404 provides as follows:\\n\"(a) Acts which are the basis of jurisdiction. The court may exercise personal jurisdiction over any non-resident of the city of New York, or his executor or administrator, as to a cause of action arising from any acts enumerated in this section, in the same manner as if he were a domiciliary of the state and a resident of the city of New York if, in person or through an agent, he:\\n\"1. transacts any business within the city of New York or contracts anywhere to supply goods or services in the city of New York; or\\n\"2. commits a tortious act within the city of New York, except as to a cause of action for defamation of character arising from the act; or\\n\"3. owns, uses or possesses any real property situated within the city of New York.” (Emphasis added.)\\nCCA 404 (a) is the local analog of New York’s long-arm statute, which asserts the State’s personal jurisdiction over New York-related acts of out-of-State individuals and corporations. (Cf, CPLR 302.) Historically, geographical limits on a court’s personal jurisdiction were viewed as a consequence of State sovereignty. (See, Pennoyer v Neff, 95 US 714.) They were regarded as necessary to prevent a State from exceeding the scope of its sovereignty and infringing upon that of other States. More recently, a territorial nexus between the forum State, the defendant and the litigation has been viewed as a necessary component of due process. Otherwise, a defendant might be haled into court in an inconvenient and remote forum. To compel a person to defend an action, when that person lacks such minimum contact with the forum, would be inconsistent with fair play and substantial justice. (International Shoe Co. v Washington, 326 US 310; Burger King Corp. v Rudzewicz, 471 US 462.)\\nThe territorial jurisdiction of the Civil Court is prescribed for precisely the same reasons. Basic fairness dictates that a defendant should not be forced to defend an action in a local court in a locality with which she has no connection. It is no coincidence that the language of CCA 404, which enumerates the New York City-related acts triggering the Civil Court’s territorial jurisdiction, is virtually identical to the equivalent provisions of the long-arm statute, which enumerates the New York State-related acts triggering the State’s personal jurisdiction over nonresidents. (Cf., CPLR 302 [a] [1], [2], [4].) CCA 404 (a) is clearly a provision designed to protect defendants, not one which specifies the types of actions that the court can adjudicate and the remedies that the court can grant. (Compare, CCA art 4, with art 2, and NY Const, art VI, § 15.) It is therefore appropriately classified as a subset of personal jurisdiction, not subject matter jurisdiction (see, Gager v White, 53 NY2d 475; Maloney v Rincon, 153 Misc 2d 162), as recognized by the statute’s drafters. A fortiori, the Civil Court is not empowered to exercise the full State-wide personal jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.\\nBased on the parties’ submissions, which do not pose a triable factual question, plaintiff’s claim is not embraced by CCA 404. Plaintiff’s claim does not arise from any New York City-related act of defendant. She did not reside, transact business, contract to supply goods or services, commit a tortious act or own or use any real property in the City of New York.\\nD. Direct Estoppel\\nIrrespective of the appropriateness of the CPLR 325 (d) order, plaintiff is estopped from arguing that this action can be entertained by the Civil Court. Plaintiff previously had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the identical jurisdictional issue. After a fact-finding hearing held in the prior Civil Court action, Judge Arber decided it adversely to plaintiff. (See, Spinnell v Doris L. Sassower, P. C, supra.) The rarely encountered common-law doctrine of direct estoppel precludes him from litigating it anew. Direct estoppel is a species of issue preclusion that prevents a party from relitigating the same issue already determined against that party in a prior lawsuit on the same claim. (Restatement [Second] of Judgments § 27; Weinstein-Korn-Miller, CPLR Manual § 25.01 [Chase 2d ed 1980]; Siegel, NY Prac §443, at 672 [2d ed].) It is of no significance, in this context, that plaintiff apparently sued only the corporate defendant in the prior action. Mutuality of estoppel is no longer required for issue preclusion via collateral estoppel (B. R. De Witt, Inc. v Hall, 19 NY2d 141); a fortiori, it should not be required for a direct estoppel.\\nIn contrast, the jurisdictional issue at bar was neither raised nor litigated before Judge Grossman; thus it was not determined by the Supreme Court transfer order. Consequently, neither the law of the case doctrine nor any estoppel theory bars defendant from asserting the jurisdictional objection here. It is unseemly for plaintiff to suggest otherwise, particularly since he neglected to inform Judge Grossman of Judge Arber’s adverse decision on this issue.\\nIt is immaterial here that defendant did not specifically move to dismiss on the direct estoppel; she did not thereby waive its protection. CPLR 3211 (a) (5) uses \"collateral estoppel” and \"res judicata” genetically to mean all varieties of issue preclusion and claim preclusion. CPLR 3211 (e) provides that such an objection is waived unless \"raised either by * * * motion or in the responsive pleading”; it does not require that it be separately enumerated. It was sufficient that defendant raised the issue by citing Judge Arber’s decision in support of her motion under CPLR 3211 (a) (8), thereby giving plaintiff adequate notice.\\nII\\nAn objection to the Civil Court’s territorial jurisdiction, like any other objection to personal jurisdiction, can be waived. (See, Meyers v American Locomotive Co., 201 NY 163; Haas v Scholl, 68 Misc 2d 197.) Plaintiff has not met his burden of showing that defendant waived her long-standing objection to this court’s jurisdiction. Given the convoluted procedural history of this litigation and the complicated ministerial acts required for transfer, it is clear that defendant’s motion was timely, and that her jurisdictional defense was preserved, when she served this motion in November 1991. (See, CPLR 3211 [e].) She did not act inconsistently with her position, despite plaintiffs assertion to the contrary. Defendant’s appearance and answer in the Supreme Court action did not prospectively waive the Civil Court’s limited territorial jurisdiction. Appearance in one court is not an automat consent to a subsequent transfer to any other court. Indeed, both parties understand that the Civil Court was not the proper forum, and thus could not have reasonably expected the transfer. After transfer, defendant’s initial failure to seek a stay while moving to dismiss was ill-considered; it did not waive her jurisdictional objection.\\nIll\\nThis court lacks power to. return the action to the Supreme Court. The Civil Court is a court of limited jurisdiction. It has no inherent transfer power and has not been given, by Constitution or statute, the power to effect such a retransfer. (See, NY Const, art VI, §§ 15, 19; CPLR 325.) Such power is not incidental, i.e., it does not necessarily and automatically flow from the jurisdiction specifically granted; it thus cannot be assumed. (See, CCA 212; Siegel, Practice Commentaries, McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 29A, CCA 212, at 92.) Only the Supreme Court has general power to remove a case from the court where it was mistakenly brought, to then place it in the proper court. (See, CPLR 325 [a].) Similarly, the Supreme Court, or another court having adequate jurisdiction, can, on motion, remove a case from a lower court if it appears the lower court does not have the jurisdiction required to grant the relief sought. (CPLR 325 [b].) Thus, the Supreme Court can entertain a motion to retransfer to itself a case originally brought in the Supreme Court, which had been transferred downward prior to the realization that the lower court was an inappropriate forum. (See, Huston v Rao, 74 AD2d 127; Hornung v Mucci, 52 AD2d 904.)\\nThe Constitution specifically prohibits the Civil Court from effecting such a retransfer, even of a case over which the Civil Court lacks jurisdiction. (NY Const, art VI, § 19 [f].) The framers wisely recognized that permitting lower courts to return erroneously transferred cases would only compound the embarrassment. It would be as unproductive as it would be unseemly for courts to engage in an interminable ping-pong match, transferring and retransferring cases between them. (See, Friedman v Strand, 203 Misc 170, supra.) Conversely, the constitutional provision prohibiting retransfer does not authorize the Civil Court to adjudicate the merits of transferred cases over which it lacks jurisdiction. Neither does it bar the Civil Court from adjudicating jurisdiction. (NY Const, art VI, § 19 [f].)\\nCCA 306 states: \"The bringing of an action or proceeding in the wrong county shall not be deemed a jurisdictional defect, but the court may * * * transfer * * * to a proper county.” This provision is inapplicable here. It is not a jurisdictional grant, and does not authorize the Civil Court to transfer this case to a court in Westchester County. It is a change of venue provision only. Venue presumes jurisdiction. Only a court having both subject matter and personal jurisdiction can change the venue of an action pending in one county branch to another county branch of the same court. (See, Siegel, Practice Commentaries, McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 29A, CCA 306, at 111-113.) Even if the Civil Court had jurisdiction of the instant case, it could not transfer it to a different court under the guise of a change of venue. (See, Fountainhead Caterers v Peck, 42 Misc 2d 330; Roseman v McAvoy, 92 Misc 2d 1063.)\\nThis court is therefore constrained to dismiss this action.\\nCONCLUSION\\nThe defendant’s motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction is accordingly granted. This action is hereby ordered dismissed without prejudice to timely commencement of a new action in any court of appropriate jurisdiction in Westchester County.\\nThe motion and cross motion seeking costs and sanctions are denied. Given the conduct of each party, neither is entitled to costs. Under the unique circumstances of this case, the court declines, in its discretion, to impose sanctions at this time. (See, 22 NYCRR 130-1.1.)\\nPlaintiffs motion to restore the action to the inquest calendar, and defendant’s motion for pendente lite relief, are both denied as moot.\\n1\\n. The notice of motion is signed \"Doris L. Sassower, pro se” and does not specify that the motion is being brought on behalf of both named defendants; contextually, however, it is clear from the motion papers that Sassower seeks dismissal of the entire action against both herself as an individual and the professional corporation. Similarly, plaintiff’s papers treat the motion, and the jurisdictional objection, as applying to both Sassower and the professional corporation. Each side, however, alternates in usage between \"defendants” and \"defendant”, apparently used collectively. Moreover, given Sassower’s indefinite suspension from the practice of law, the current status of the professional corporation is unclear. Accordingly, the court will use \"defendant” to denote Sassower in both her individual and corporate capacities. While a suspended attorney may not represent another party during the period of her suspension, she may appear pro se in her individual capacity, and pro se as the president of the professional corporation. Thus, because plaintiff has not raised any objection to Sassower speaking on behalf of the professional corporation (as distinguished from holding herself out as an attorney or practicing law under the aegis of a professional corporation), and because pro se appearance on behalf of the professional corporation does not appear to contravene the suspension order, it would be improper to ignore the parties’ mutual assumption that the instant motion applies to both Sassower and Sassower, P. C.; moreover, it would be unfair to require Sassower to hire separate counsel to represent a dormant or defunct professional corporation when Sassower is the real party in interest. (See, CPLR 321 [c]; see also, Austrian, Lance & Steward v Hastings Props., 87 Misc 2d 25.)\\n2\\n. Collateral estoppel bars relitigation of an issue already determined adversely to a party in a prior action concerning a different claim. (See, Schuylkill Fuel Corp. v Nieberg Realty Corp., 250 NY 304 [Cardozo, J.].) The term is frequently used broadly, as a synonym for claim preclusion.\\n3\\n. Until the entered transfer order and file were finally received from Supreme Court, a Civil Court index number assigned, a file opened, the case calendared by the clerk, and the parties notified, motion practice in the Civil Court would have been futile. A motion would have been premature unless the action was actually pending in the Civil Court; a logistical nightmare would have resulted had the motion been brought before the clerk completed all necessary ministerial acts.\\n4\\n. Defendant therefore could have attended in Trial Part I on any of the subsequent dates without fear that her presence would have been deemed a jurisdiction-conferring appearance. (CPLR 320 [b]; 3211 [e].)\\n5\\n. Plaintiff contends that this court would be arrogating to itself appel late powers if it were not to accept the CPLR 325 (d) transfer and try the action. Unterberg v Scarsdale Improvement Corp. (128 Misc 2d 873), on which plaintiff relies, is distinguishable from the case at bar. The Unterberg court found that neither party had objected to the lower court’s jurisdiction and thus waived any objection. The Unterberg court found that the lower court incorrectly raised an objection to personal jurisdiction sua sponte. In contrast, the defendant timely asserted her objection twice: first, before Judge Arber, in the prior action; and second, in the instant motion. It would be improper for this court to shirk its duty to decide a properly raised jurisdictional objection; it would be unethical for this court to proceed on the merits when it knows that it lacks jurisdiction.\\n6\\n. Neither side sought reargument of the CPLR 325 (d) transfer order. Neither side has moved in the Supreme Court for retransfer or sought a stay of this action for the purpose of moving for retransfer in the Supreme Court. (See, CPLR 326 [a].) Under all the circumstances, it would be inappropriate for this court, sua sponte, to grant a stay of dismissal to permit a retransfer motion to be brought in the Supreme Court.',\n",

       "       'text': 'Bobbitt, J.\\nThe Durham County Civil Court was established under the statute now codified as G.S. Chapter 7, Article 35, and has jurisdiction concurrent with the superior court in tort actions wherein the amount demanded does not exceed $1,500.00, exclusive of interest and costs. G.S. 7-372(3). See Perry v. Owens, 257 N.C. 98, 101, 125 S.E. 2d 287.\\nG.S. 7-378, in pertinent part, provides:\\n“Appeals in actions may be taken from the county civil court within ten days from date of rendition of judgment to the superior court of the county in term time, for errors assigned in matters of law or legal inference, in the same manner as is provided for appeals from the superior court to the Supreme Court, except as follows:\\n“(1) The appellant shall cause a copy of the statement of case on appeal to he served on the respondent within thirty days from the entry of the appeal taken, and the respondent, within fifteen days after such service, shall return the copy with his approval or specific amendments endorsed or attached; if the case he approved by the respondent, it shall be filed with the cleric as a part of the record; if not returned with objections within the time prescribed, it shall be deemed approved: Provided, that .the judge trying the case shall have the power, in the exercise of his discretion, to enlarge the time in which to serve statement of. case on appeal and exceptions thereto or counter statement of casé.; (Our italics.)\\n“(2) The appellant shall file one typewritten copy of the statement of case on appeal, as settled, containing the exceptions and assignments of error, which, together with the original record, shall be transmitted by the clerk of the county civil court to the superior court as the complete record on appeal in said court. (Our italics.)\\n“(3) The record in the case on appeal to the superior court must be docketed in the superior court within ten days after the date of settling the case on appeal. If the appellant shall fail to perfect his appeal within the prescribed time, the appellee may file with the clerk of superior court a certificate of the clerk of court from which the appeal comes showing the names of the parties thereto, the time when the judgment and appeal were taken, the name of the appellant and the date of the settling of case on appeal, if any has been settled, with his motion to docket and dismiss said appeal at appellant’s cost, which motion shall be allowed at the first regular term or any succeeding regular term of the superior court.” (Our italics.)\\nJudge Johnson’s order recites: “It Fuether Appearing to the Court that the appellants did not file or serve their Statement of Case on Appeal in this action until the 17th day of November, 1965, the ninety-first (91st) day following the Notice of Appeal . . .” (Our italics.)\\nG.S. 7-378 provides the following procedure: An appellant is required to serve a copy of his statement of case on appeal on the appellee within the prescribed time. The case on appeal is to be filed in the Durham County Civil Court upon settlement thereof. Thereupon, “the statement of case on appeal, as settled, containing the exceptions and assignments of error,” together with the record proper, are to be transmitted by the clerk of the county civil court to the superior court. This record must be docketed in the superior court within ten days “after the date of settling the case on appeal.” (Our italics.)\\nIn our view, the crucial question is whether a copy of defendants’ statement of case on appeal was served on plaintiffs within the prescribed time. The record does not disclose with certainty that such copy was ever served on plaintiffs. It does appear that defendants’ statement of case on appeal was not served on anybody or in any manner until November 17, 1965, that is, after the expiration of the ninety days allowed for service thereof.\\nJudge Johnson’s order does not indicate the ground of his decision.\\nDefendants contend the granting or denial of plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss was for determination by Judge Johnson in his discretion. The asserted basis for this contention is that defendants’ statement of case on appeal was filed in the Durham County Civil Court on November 17, 1965, prior to the filing (on November 18, 1965) of plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss. McLean v. McDonald, 175 N.C. 418, 95 S.E. 769, is typical of decisions cited and relied on by defendants. They relate to dismissals of appeals to this Court for failure to docket within the time prescribed by our rules. In this connection, it is sufficient to say: Nothing in the record indicates a case on appeal was settled by agreement or otherwise; and, until settlement of a case on appeal, G.S. 7-378 made no provision for the filing in the Durham County Civil Court of defendants’ statement of case on appeal or for the transmittal thereof from the Durham County Civil Court to the Durham County Superior Court. Defendants make no contention that error appears on the face of the record proper in the Durham County Civil Court.\\nG.S. 1-287.1, discussed in both briefs, relates to the dismissal by the superior court of appeals therefrom to the Supreme Court. If applicable under any circumstances to an appeal from the county civil court to the superior court, it could apply only to a motion to dismiss addressed to the county civil court.\\nIn view of the fact that defendants failed to serve statement of case on appeal on plaintiffs within the ninety days allowed therefor, plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss defendants’ purported appeal from the Durham County Civil Court should have been granted. Hence, the order of the court below is reversed.\\nMotions made by plaintiffs and by defendants suggesting diminution of the record have been considered and denied. Nothing contained in the suggested addenda to the record affects the basis of decision on this appeal.\\nReversed.\\nMoore, J., not sitting.',\n",

       "       'text': \"Martha Zelman, J.\\nBefore the Bench is an action by plaintiff in the sum of $2,583 representing nine monthly support payments pursuant to a separation agreement executed on August 31, 1967 and incorporated in a divorce decree granted in Chihuahua, ithe Republic of Mexico. Strangely enough the defendant husband was the moving party in the divorce action. Today, eight years later, defendant in his answer alleges two affirmative defenses and .counterclaims; “ that defendant-husband was duressed and coerced into execution of the Separation Agreement and that the plaintiff-wife was physically and mentally infirmed .and incapacitated at the time of execution of the Separation Agreement.”\\nPlaintiff, before proceeding to trial by jury, has made a motion to strike the defendant’s defenses as insufficient in law and that a verdict be directed for plaintiff. Plaintiff has raised the argument that the defendant is barred by the Statute of Limitations in bringing this action. CPLR 203 (subd. [c]) states “ a defense or counterclaim is not barred if it was not barred at the time the claims asserted in the complaint were interposed, except that if the defense or counterclaim ariose from the transactions * * * upon which a claim asserted in the complaint depends, it is not barred to the extent of the demand in the complaint notwithstanding that it was barred at the time the claims asserted in the complaint were interposed.” The section applies to commencing actions within the statutory period and therefore the defendant’s Contention that the Statute of Limitations has not run as to his defenses and counterclaims is correct.\\nPlaintiff, however, contends that the Civil Court has no equitable jurisdiction to reform, rescind or modify separation agreements relating to marriage contracts. “ Absent a specific grant of power, [the Civil Court of the City of New York] may not exercise ordinary powers of a court of equity.” (See Kwoczka v. Dry Dock Savs. Bank, 52 Misc 2d 67, 70.) The Civil Court has no general equity jurisdiction except as specifically provided by statute.\\nInterestingly enough, but sadly, section 203 of the New York City Civil Court Act empowers the Civil Court to grant equitable relief to litigants in respect to actions involving real property, but not with respect to matters involving people’s rights, i.e., contractual rights, support, etc. In the opinion of this court the Legislature has ndt had the foresight to keep equitable jurisdiction in matters under $10,000 together with actions at law in one court. Certainly this would be more feasible as well as more economical and improve the quality of justice granted in our Civil Court system. To refuse one to come to the Civil Court for money damages on a contract and go to the 'Supreme Court for rescission or reformation on the same Contract is to duplicate the litigation and must cause severe hardship on litigants seeking their day in court. Since the Civil Court is presently being used to handle Supreme Court cases why not transfer the equitable jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to the Civil Court in matters less than $10,000? Therefore, this court must also dismiss the plaintiff’s argument that the suit is barred on the ground of laches since this is also an equitable remedy. (See 36 N. Y. Jur., Limitations and Laches, 1 153, p. 140.) The doctrine of laches is a doctrine peculiarly applicable to suits in equity; it does not operate to bar actions at law. (See Wynn v. Wynn, 189 Misc. 96.)\\nTherefore, this court must direct a verdict for plaintiff in the sum of $2,583, plus interest and cost from May 1,1974. The court must dismiss defendant’s counterclaims and defenses without prejudice since matters of equity with regard to people are not within the jurisdiction of this court.\\nThere being no triable issues of fact, the jury is disbanded.\",\n",

       "       'text': '—Order, Supreme Court, New York County (Paula Omansky, J.), entered September 10, 1997, which denied plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and dismissed the action without prejudice, and did not grant defendant’s motion for attorneys’ fees, unanimously modified, on the law, to the extent of reinstating the complaint, and otherwise affirmed, without costs.\\nThe IAS Court dismissed without prejudice plaintiffs complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief relating to defendant-tenant’s violation of the no-pet provision of her lease, finding that the appropriate course for plaintiff to pursue was to bring a proceeding in Civil Court for possession of tenant’s apartment. In reaching its decision, the court cited at length from Cox v J.D. Realty Assocs. (217 AD2d 179), where this Court stated “[i]n the absence of any showing that Civil Court is unable to afford complete relief to plaintiffs, there is no basis for the application to Supreme Court for declaratory and equitable relief’ (supra, at 183). The IAS Court here reasoned that because the “net result is the same” regardless of where the action was pursued — i.e., in either court, defendant will have to choose between her apartment and her dog — the action could just as well be resolved, in Civil Court and “a Supreme Court order is not required.” We find to the contrary that plaintiff was entitled to bring this action in Supreme Court and therefore reinstate the complaint.\\nAs discussed in Cox, Civil Court is generally the preferred forum for landlord-tenant disputes. In Cox, the parties’ dispute was over succession rights and possession of the premises, issues that clearly can be decided by Civil Court. In the instant case, however, Civil Court cannot afford “complete relief’ to plaintiff, which seeks equitable relief available only in Supreme Court; the limited injunctive and restraining authority of Civil Court does not extend to the matter in dispute (see, CCA 203 M).\\nIndeed, the circumstances of the instant matter are almost identical to those of Trump Vil. Section 3 v Sinrod (219 AD2d 590), where plaintiff-landlord sought both a declaratory judgment and an injunction regarding a tenant’s violation of a no-pet clause. The Second Department concluded that “[s]ince the New York City Civil Court cannot grant the injunctive relief sought by the plaintiff, the action was properly commenced in the Supreme Court” (219 AD2d, supra, at 592), and this reasoning is equally applicable in the matter before us. While defendant dismisses Trump Vil. as having “no authority” in this Court, we note that the language excerpted above is followed by a citation to three cases from this Court: Manhattan Parking Sys.-Serv. Corp. v Murray House Owners Corp. (211 AD2d 534); DeCastro v Bhokari (201 AD2d 382); and Hotel New Yorker Pharmacy v New Yorker Hotel Corp. (40 AD2d 967).\\nWe further note that, while it is of course not dispositive, the lease provision at issue specifies that the landlord may seek precisely the remedy it sought in Supreme Court. In addition, the Administrative Code of the City of New York expressly provides a landlord with the option of pursuing an “action to enforce a lease provision prohibiting the keeping of* * * pets” (§ 27-2009.1 [b]). While defendant now claims in this Court that the no-pet provision is unenforceable as a contract of adhesion, we find this argument to be without merit (see, e.g., Gillman v Chase Manhattan Bank, 73 NY2d 1, 10).\\nFinally, with respect to defendant’s claim that she was entitled to attorneys’ fees because she had successfully defended the declaratory judgment action, such fees are appropriate only when a court’s decision constitutes the ultimate outcome of the matter (see, e.g., Centennial Restorations Co. v Wyatt, 248 AD2d 193, 197). This was clearly not the case here, where the IAS Court dismissed the complaint without preju dice and in the expectation that the landlord would pursue its claims in Civil Court.

       "       'text': 'Abb.attam N. Geller, J.\\nIn signing the judgment to be entered upon the granting of the application to confirm the award herein, the court has stricken the provision for $25 taxable costs (hereinafter discussed) and has added provision for taxation of disbursements (see CPLR 8301, subd. [c]) and for interest from date of award (Matter of Durant [MVAIC], 15 N Y 2d 408).\\nCPLR 8102 (subd. 1) provides that a plaintiff is not entitled to costs in an action brought in the Supreme Court in a county within the City of New York which could have been brought in the Civil Court of the City of New York unless he shall recover $6,000 or more. Under subdivision (b) of section 206 of the New York City Civil Court Act (CCA, § 206, subd. [b]), the Civil Court has jurisdiction to enter judgment on an award made for relief within that court’s jurisdiction. This award against MVAIC was for $4,000 and administrative fees. Application to confirm that award could have been made in the Civil Court; it is only applications by “ qualified ” persons for leave to sue MVAIC that are required to be brought in the Supreme Court (Insurance Law, § 608). Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to costs in this court (see Matter of Rivera [MVAIC], N. Y. L. J., Aug. 25, 1966, p. 7, col. 5).\\nThe impact of these provisions reveals an anomaly in the costs provided in this connection under the CPLR and CCA. While the sum of $25 is taxable under CPLR 8201 (subd. 1) upon the entry of judgment before a note of issue is filed, subdivision (b) of section 1903 of the CCA allows costs where judgment is recovered upon motion before trial (which appears to be the provision applicable to a motion to confirm an award and for judgment thereon), at one half the amount taxable after a trial, which is fixed at about $5 for every $100 but not exceeding $150. Under that provision, the costs in the New York City Civil Court upon entering judgment confirming this award would have been about $100. This appears to be too much for the rather simple motion to confirm an award. If these provisions are applicable, as they seem to be, an application for judgment confirming an award of $6,000 or more in the Supreme Court would allow for $25 costs while the same type of application in the Civil Court for an award in the amount of $5,900 or more would allow for about $150 costs. It might be noted, parenthetically, that the same situation exists with respect to judgments entered upon the granting of summary judgment.\\nWhen the New York City Civil Court was given jurisdiction to enter judgment upon an award within that court’s jurisdiction, no corresponding particular costs provision was added to the detailed costs sections of the New York City Civil Court Act. The subject should be reviewed to provide for an equitable amount of costs in both courts on applications to confirm arbitration awards.',\n",

       "       'text': 'Gunter, Justice.\\nThis appeal is from a judgment rendered after a temporary hearing that denied injunctive relief sought by appellant and dismissed appellant’s equitable complaint. We affirm that judgment.\\nAppellees filed a dispossessory action against appellant on August 29, 1974, in the Civil Court of DeKalb County. On the same date appellant filed this action for equitable relief in DeKalb Superior Court. The superior court judge entered a temporary restraining order in favor of the appellant, later conducted a temporary hearing, and after the hearing he entered a judgment that denied a temporary injunction sought by the appellant and dismissed appellant’s complaint \"without prejudice to the plaintiffs right to assert any defenses or claims, which he may have, growing out of the transaction giving rise to said dispossessory proceeding” that was pending in the Civil Court of DeKalb County.\\nAppellees are lessors of real property, and appellant is the lessee, being the transferee of. the original lessee, Texaco, Inc. The appellees filed their dispossessory action against appellant in the civil court and contended that the lease had terminated, and that the appellants should be ousted from their property. The trial judge in this case found that the dispossessory action was pending in the civil court at the time appellant filed this action to enjoin appellees from pursuing their action in the civil court. The trial judge determined that the only material issue for decision in both cases was whether the appellant did or did not have the right to continue in possession of the property. He ruled: \"That all the relief which plaintiff seeks in this action can be afforded plaintiff in said dispossessory proceeding.” He therefore dismissed the equitable complaint ruling, in effect, that the action pending in the civil court could proceed.\\nSubmitted October 7, 1975\\nDecided January 6, 1976.\\nRoss & Finch, I. J. Parkerson, for appellant.\\nLouis F. McDonald, for appellees.\\nThe only equitable relief sought by the appellant in his complaint was to enjoin the appellees from pursuing their dispossessory action in the civil court. The trial judge properly declined to grant such injunctive relief and dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. Code Ann. § 61-303 provides that a tenant may answer a dispossessory action, the answer may contain any legal or equitable defense or counterclaim, and if the tenant answers, \"a trial of the issues shall be had in accordance with procedure prescribed for civil actions in courts of record.”\\nAppellant relies on Carswell v. Scott, 225 Ga. 798 (171 SE2d 499) (1969), but that reliance is misplaced. In Carswell the superior court plaintiffs were seeking affirmative equitable relief based on disputed title to land, but they were not seeking to merely enjoin a dispossessory action pending in another court.\\nSince the only issues for determination between the parties could be adequately decided in the dispossessory action in the civil court, the trial judge did not commit error in denying injunctive relief and dismissing appellant’s equitable complaint without prejudice.\\nJudgment affirmed.\\nAll the Justices concur.',\n",

Insofar as is relevant to this appeal, by order dated October 17, 2011, the Civil Court granted the branch of a cross motion by tenant seeking leave to conduct discovery (see CPLR 408) and directed landlord to comply with the discovery demands annexed to tenant’s papers. The court further stated, “[t]he matter is marked off calendar pending the completion of discovery. Either side may restore on motion or by stipulation.” In June of 2014, tenant moved, insofar as is relevant to this appeal, for relief pursuant to CPLR 3126, based on landlord’s failure to comply with the discovery order. Landlord cross-moved to “dismiss” the petition and strike the counterclaims, “based upon the parties [sic] abandonment of their claims.” Insofar as is relevant to this appeal, the court granted landlord’s cross motion and denied, in effect as academic, the branch of tenant’s motion seeking relief pursuant to CPLR 3126.\\nNotwithstanding the decision to the contrary in Johnson v Rockaway One Co., LLC (26 Misc 3d 901 [Civ Ct, Queens County 2009]), relied upon by the Civil Court, the Civil Court had no authority to “dismiss” the petition and strike the counterclaims on the ground that the parties had abandoned their respective causes of action, since 22 NYCRR 208.14 (c), the Civil Court rule which governs actions stricken from the calendar, makes no provision for dismissing an action for neglect to prosecute (see Harris v Stern & Montana, LLP, 16 Misc 3d 136[A], 2007 NY Slip Op 51619[U] [App Term, 2d Dept, 2d & 11th Jud Dists 2007]; see also Chavez v 407 Seventh Ave. Corp., 39 AD3d 454 [2007]; Q-B Jewish Med. Rehabilitation, P.C. v Metlife Ins. Co., 42 Misc 3d 146[A], 2014 NY Slip Op 50354[U] [App Term, 2d Dept, 2d, 11th & 13th Jud Dists 2014]). Consequently, landlord’s cross motion should have been denied.\\nBecause the Civil Court granted landlord’s cross motion to “dismiss” the petition and strike the counterclaims, it denied, in effect as academic, the branch of tenant’s motion seeking relief pursuant to CPLR 3126. Therefore, the matter is remitted to the Civil Court for a new determination of that branch of tenant’s motion.\\nAccordingly, the order, insofar as appealed from, is reversed, landlord’s cross motion to, on the ground of abandonment, “dismiss” the petition and strike the counterclaims is denied, and the matter is remitted to the Civil Court for a new determination of the branch of tenant’s motion seeking relief pursuant to CPLR 3126.\\nPesce, P.J., Weston and Aliotta, JJ., concur.',\n",

Jury trial was held on the issues presented on May 20,1958, and continued to May 21, 1953, and a jury verdict was rendered in behalf of the plaintiff in the sum of $800; the defendant’s counterclaim being denied. The civil court of record granted defendant’s motion for a new trial, and plaintiff took this appeal.\\nThis court has examined the record, including the transcript of testimony and considered the briefs and arguments of counsel and finds that the trial of this case was begun by Hon. Silver S. Squarcia, as judge of the civil court of record, prior to the time that Hon. John C. Wynn, his successor in office, took the oath of office to replace him as judge of the civil court of record, and that Hon. Silver S.

Squarcia was authorized to continue and conclude the trial of the case as a de facto judge and to take the actions which he took in the course of the trial as the presiding judge in the case.\\nFrom an examination of the record, this court finds that the trial court committed no reversible error, and it is therefore ordered that the order granting a new trial be and it is reversed, with instructions that final judgment be entered for plaintiff pursuant to the jury verdict, and that the costs of this appeal be assessed against the defendant.',\n",

Iola Bell Scott filed an action in the Civil Court of Pulton County against Freeman Carswell and others, seeking damages for personal property loss and injury resulting from the execution of a dispossessory warrant sworn out by the defendants. She asserted ownership and possession of the property on which the trespass was committed. The defendants in the civil court action filed a complaint in the Superior Court of Fulton County, claiming title by deed to the property on which the trespass was alleged to have been committed, and asserting that the deed under which the plaintiff in the civil court claimed was obtained by duress and was void. Carswell sought decree of title, damages, a quitclaim deed from the holder of a security deed on the property, and injunction against the further prosecution of the civil court case. Temporary restraining order was granted, and was dissolved after hearing.\\nThe superior courts have exclusive jurisdiction in cases respecting title to land and equity. Constitution, Art. VI, Sec. IV, Par. I ('Code Ann. § 2-3901). The basic dispute between the parties is title to the property on which the trespass was alleged to have been committed. The appellants seek a decree of title and affirmative equitable relief, which cannot be granted in the Civil Court of Fulton County. The civil court action should have been enjoined, and the actions consolidated for trial in a court having jurisdiction of the claims of both parties. Butler v.

Although defendant Thompson, as the Administrative Judge of the Civil Court of the City of New York, was fully authorized and empowered to administer that court, his authority extends only to matters of administration and he may not issue rules affecting substantive rights of parties to Civil Court proceedings. It does not appear to us that Directives 255, 276 and Memo J-3 were intended to impinge upon substantive rights or abrogate the discretion of the Judges of the Civil Court. These \"directives” are hortatory rather than mandatory in form, they are guidelines, not calculated to interfere with the customary discretion accorded to Civil Court Judges.

       "       'text': \"LAWSON, Justice.\\nThis suit comes here on a nonsuit taken by appellant, plaintiff below, on account of the adverse rulings of the trial court on the pleadings. § 819, Title 7, Code 1940.\\nOn May 16, 1958, Odis W. Logan filed suit in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County to recover damages from the defendant, Billy H. O’Barr, alleged to have resulted from the negligent and wanton conduct of the defendant in operating an automobile which was in a collision on February 24, 1958, at the intersection of 36th Avenue, North, and 63rd Street in the City of Birmingham with an automobile operated by the plaintiff.\\nOn May 30, 1958, the defendant, O’Barr, filed a demurrer which as refiled to the amended complaint was overruled on May 22, 1959.\\nThere appears to be disagreement as to the pleas which the defendant, O’Barr, filed immediately after his demurrer was overruled. One attorney who has filed a brief here on behalf of Logan takes the position that O’Barr filed Pleas One and Two but struck those pleas before filing Pleas Three and Four. On the other hand, another attorney who appears here on behalf of Logan argues in effect that Pleas One and Two were filed and had not been stricken prior to the filing of Pleas Three and Four. Counsel for O’Barr contends that Pleas One and Two were never filed.\\nThe record proper shows that on May 22, 1959, O’Barr filed an instrument which bears the caption “Answer,” which instrument as originally drafted consisted of four pleas. Plea One is the general issue. Plea Two is a plea of contributory negligence. Plea Three avers the existence of a judgment in another court which is averred to be “res judicata of this cause.” Plea Four also avers the existence of the judgment in the other court, which judgment the plea avers estops the plaintiff, Logan, from maintaining this suit.\\nPleas One and Two are set out in the record before us as a part of the “Answer,” but two ink lines which cross to form an X have been drawn across those pleas as they appear in this record.\\nThere is no mention of Pleas One and Two in the judgment entry. That entry recites in pertinent parts as follows:\\n“It is ordered and adjudged by the court that said demurrer be and the same is hereby overruled; the defendant by separate paper filed interposes pleas Three and Four, separately and severally, to Counts One and Two as amended, separately and severally.” (Emphasis supplied.)\\nOur decisions support the view that even when there is a conflict between the judgment entry and other parts of the record proper, the judgment entry should prevail. See Clary v. Cassels, 258 Ala. 183, 61 So.2d 692, and cases cited.\\nWe think the record should be construed as showing that the defendant, O’Barr, filed only Pleas Three and Four.\\nOn June 10, 1959, the plaintiff, Logan, filed a motion to strike Pleas Three and Four. On the same day without waiving his motion to strike, Logan filed a demurrer to those pleas and also without waiving his motion to strike or his demurrer, Logan, on the same day, filed his Replications One, Two and Three to the defendant’s Pleas Three and Four. Replication One was directed to Plea Three. Replication Two went to Plea Four and Replication Three was directed to Pleas Three and Four.\\nThe trial court, on June 10, 1959, overruled the plaintiff’s motion to strike, as well as his demurrer to the defendant’s Pleas Three and Four.\\nThe defendant thereupon, in open court, filed demurrer to the plaintiff’s Replications One, Two and Three, which demurrer was sustained as to each of the replications.\\nPlaintiff Logan then filed his Replication Four directed to defendant’s Pleas Three and Four. The defendant ther««upon demurred to plaintiff’s Replication Four. The demurrer was sustained.\\nPlaintiff thereupon moved for a nonsuit “on account of the adverse rulings of the court against the plaintiff.” The motion was granted and a judgment of nonsuit entered. As shown above, this appeal was then taken by the plaintiff in accordance with the provisions of § 819, Title 7, Code 1940.\\nLogan has assigned as error the action of the trial court in overruling his motion to strike O’Barr’s Pleas Three and Four, in overruling his demurrer to those pleas, and in sustaining O’Barr’s demurrer to Logan’s replications.\\nWhere several adverse rulings, taken together, superinduced the nonsuit and such fact or necessity is apparent by the record, all of such adverse rulings will be considered on appeal where proper assignments of error are made and argued. Berlin Machine Works v. Ewart Lumber Co., 184 Ala. 272, 63 So. 567; Schillinger v. Wickersham, 199 Ala. 612, 75 So. 11; Esslinger v. Spragins, 236 Ala. 508, 183 So. 401.\\nThe record in this case, we think, sufficiently shows that it was the cumulative effect of the several rulings assigned as error which superinduced the nonsuit. Consequently, all of such adverse rulings assigned as error and properly argued in briefs filed on behalf of Logan will be considered. Berlin Machine Works v. Ewart Lumber Co., supra.\\nThere is no merit in the assignment of error to the effect that the trial court erred in overruling Logan’s motion to strike Pleas Three and Four. Demurrer, and not motion to strike, is the appropriate method of testing the sufficiency of pleas. May v. Strickland, 235 Ala. 482, 180 So. 93; Davis v. Jones, 236 Ala. 684, 184 So. 896; Plarris v. Barber, 237 Ala. 138, 186 So. 160. Motions to strike should be granted only where the pleadings are unnecessarily prolix, irrelevant, frivolous or unnecessarily repeated. May v. Strickland, supra, and cases cited.\\nWe come now to a consideration of the assignment of error to the effect that the trial court erred in overruling Logan’s demurrer to Pleas Three and Four.\\nPlea Three reads as follows:\\n“Defendant says that after this suit was filed in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Alabama, by the plaintiff, the defendant filed suit against the plaintiff in the Intermediate Civil Court of Birmingham claiming damages for injuries to defendant’s automobile resulting from the same automobile collision which is the basis of this case, and in said case in the Intermediate Civil Court of Birmingham the plaintiff herein filed a plea of recoupment claiming the same property damages to plaintiff’s automobile and the same bodily injuries which are claimed in the case at bar, and the Intermediate Civil Court of Birmingham awarded a judgment for the present defendant against the present plaintiff in the amount of Three Hundred ($300.00) Dollars on, to-wit, August 22, 1958, at which time the Intermediate Civil Court of Birmingham denied the present plaintiff’s plea of recoupment claiming the same damages as in the case at bar, and said judgment in the Intermediate Civil Court of Birmingham is final as no appeal has been taken within the time permitted by the law of this State. Defendant further avers that the issues tried and determined in said suit in said Intermediate Civil Court of Birmingham were the questions of whether the present plaintiff herein was guilty of negligence on the occasion of this accident, which proximately damaged the defendant and if so, whether the present defendant herein was guilty of negligence which proximately contributed to his alleged injuries and damages. Defendant further avers that said judgment in the Intermediate Civil Court of Birmingham necessarily determined and adjudicated that plaintiff herein was guilty of negligence that proximately contributed to or proximately caused the present defendant’s injuries and damages to defendant’s automobile and that plaintiff herein was guilty of negligence that proximately contributed to or proximately caused his property damages and bodily injuries which are claimed in the suit at bar; defendant further avers that, said judgment in the Intermediate Civil Court of Birmingham determined and adjudicated that defendant herein was not guilty of negligence which proximately contributed to or proximately caused his own property damages, or actionable negligence which proximately contributed to or proximately caused the property damages or personal injuries sustained by the plaintiff herein.\\n“The defendant attaches hereto as Exhibit ‘A’, and makes a part hereof, a copy of the complaint as filed by this defendant in said lower court and on which the trial was had; and attaches as Exhibit 'B’, and makes a part hereof, a copy of this plaintiff’s counter claim as filed by this plaintiff in said lower court and which said counter claim was there tried, all with the result herein-above averred.\\n“New Paragraph: Defendant avers that the present plaintiff has had a trial in the Intermediate Civil Court of Birmingham based on his claim for damages against this defendant for the same occurrence named in the present suit; and that the present action, if allowed, would constitute a splitting of the cause of action.\\n“Defendant avers that the judgment in said suit in the Intermediate Civil Court of Birmingham is res judicata of this cause; wherefore, defendant avers that plaintiff ought not to recover.”\\nFour grounds of demurrer were addressed to Plea Three. The first ground reads: “Said plea fails to aver that said Intermediate Civil Coutt [sic], in which said allged [sic] judgment was obtained against this plaintiff, had jurisdiction of said cause.” There is no merit in this ground of demurrer. This court takes judicial notice of the jurisdiction of the Intermediate Civil Court of Birmingham. Mobile County v. Byrne, 218 Ala. 5, 117 So. 83. The complaint filed by O’Barr and the plea of recoupment filed by Logan, both of which are made exhibits to Plea Three, affirmatively show that the accident happened within the territorial jurisdiction of the Intermediate Civil Court of Birmingham. The amount of damages claimed in the complaint and in the plea of recoupment were within the jurisdiction of that court. Act No. 564, approved September 9, 1949, Acts 1949, p. 891.\\nThe other three grounds of demurrer are to the effect that Plea Three shows on its face that the Intermediate Civil Court of Birmingham did not have jurisdiction “of said cause” because it is shown in that plea that the suit in the Circuit Court by Logan against O’Barr was pending at the time O’Barr filed his suit against Logan in the Intermediate Civil Court of Birmingham.\\nThe mere pendency of the suit in the Circuit Court would not have deprived the Intermediate Civil Court of Birmingham of jurisdiction over a suit subsequently filed in that court by Logan against O’Barr. It would only have furnished an occasion for an abatement of a subsequent suit. But until abated, the subsequent suit could proceed to final judgment, even before the former comes on for trial and could then be res judicata of the former. Strother v. McCord, 222 Ala. 450, 132 So. 717; Alabama Power Co. v. City of Scottsboro, 238 Ala. 230, 190 So. 412.\\nIt follows that if the Intermediate Civil Court of Birmingham could have proceeded to final judgment in a suit by Logan against O’Barr wherein Logan’s cause of action was based on the same collision, unless the suit in the Circuit Court was pleaded in abatement it could proceed to final judgment in a suit by O’Barr against Logan when, according to the averments of Plea Three, Logan not only failed to question the jurisdiction of the said inferior court, but sought affirmative relief against O’Barr by filing his plea of recoupment.\\nWe are not called'upon to decide whether an appropriate plea filed by Logan in the said inferior court setting up the pendency of the'suit by Logan against O’Barr in the Circuit Court would have operated to prevent the further maintenance of the suit by O’Barr in the said inferior court.\\nPlea Three, in our opinion, shows that the parties in the litigation in the Intermediate Civil Court of Birmingham are the same as the parties in this suit in the Circuit Court. The subject matter is the same. O’Barr’s negligence, which is the basis of Count One of the complaint in the Circuit Court case, was directly in issue in the trial in the Intermediate Civil Court of Birmingham and a judgment on that point was rendered at the conclusion of that trial.\\nWe are of the opinion that Plea Three is a good plea of res judicata as against the grounds of demurrer interposed to it and that the trial court did not err in overruling the demurrer to Plea Three.\\nThe form of Plea Three is not questioned by any ground of demurrer, nor does any ground raise the point that the judgment in the Intermediate Civil Court cannot be res •judicata of Count Two of the complaint in the Circuit Court which charges O’Barr with wantonness. That question is not discussed in brief and is not considered here.\\nThe action of the trial court in overruling demurrer to Plea Four is assigned as error jointly with the action of the court in overruling demurrer to Plea Three. We have heretofore shown that we are of the opinion that the court did not err in overruling demurrer to Plea Three. An assignment of error which embraces more than one ruling must, to be sustainable, be good as to all. Lane v. Housing Authority of the City of Elba, Ala., 118 So.2d 725/ and cases cited. We are not called upon, therefore, to give any separate consideration to the sufficiency of Plea Four as against the demurrers interposed thereto.\\nIn his-Replication One, which is addressed to Plea Three, the plaintiff, Logan, avers in part as follows:\\n“ * * * that although this plaintiff filed in said Intermediate Civil Court a plea in abatement to defendant’s said suit, showing that said Intermediate Civil Court, did not have jurisdiction over said cause, due to the fact that said cause was already pending in Circuit Court at Birmingham, Ala, said Court overruled said plea in abatement, thereby attempting to take away from said Circuit Court its jurisdiction of said action, and said Court rendered a judgment against this plaintiff for $300.00. Immediately after said judgment was rendered, plaintiff took an appeal bond appealing said case to the Circuit Court with jury demanded thereon, and filed same with the clerk of said Inferior (Intermediate Civil Court), and thought that same had been appealed; but it appears that said bond was not honored or it was lost or mislaid, so that same appears not to be now available. * * * ”\\nLogan’s failure to have the ruling on his plea in abatement reviewed by the Circuit Court of Jefferson County on appeal does not avoid the averments of Plea Three. In our opinion demurrer to Replication One was sustained without error.\\nReplication Two is in substance the same as Replication One except it is addressed to Plea Four. The demurrer to Replication Two was in our opinion sustained without error.\\nReplication Three seems to be designed to question the constitutionality of the acts of the Legislature which created and which define the jurisdiction of the Intermediate Civil Court of Birmingham. In regard to this replication, it is sufficient to say that in the briefs filed here on behalf of the appellant, Logan, no reference is made to the action of the trial court in sustaining demurrer to that replication.\\nThe same may be said of Replication Four, which was addressed to both Pleas Three and Four, which charges, in effect, that O’Barr in bringing his suit in the Intermediate Civil Court of Birmingham acted fraudulently and “for the purpose of robbing or defwating [sic] the jurisdiction” of the Circuit Court. No mention is made in appellant’s briefs of the action of the trial court in sustaining demurrer to Replication Four and consequently the trial court’s action thereon will not be considered here.\\nIn both briefs filed on behalf of the appellant, Logan, references are made to matters which do not appear in this record. We see no occasion to make specific mention of those references because the rule is well settled that we cannot consider statements in appellant’s briefs not supported by the record. Grace v. Birmingham Trust & Savings Co, 257 Ala. 507, 59 So.2d 595, and cases cited; Christian v. Reed, 265 Ala. 533, 92 So.2d 881.\\nWe have considered the questions which we believe have been adequately presented for treatment and have not attempted to deal with other questions. We find no reversible error and the judgment of the Circuit Court is due to be affirmed. It is so ordered.\\nAffirmed.\\nLIVINGSTON, C. J, and STAKELY, GOODWYN, MERRILL and COLEMAN, JJ, concur.\\n1\\n. 270 Ala. 383.\",\n",

       "       'text': 'JONES, Justice.\\nThis is an appeal from the Circuit Court of Pickens County, in Equity, which denied appellant-complainant John David Jordan’s request for declaratory and injunctive relief against the practice of taking judgments in the Civil Court of Jefferson County against non-residents of Jefferson County.\\nThe sole dispositive issue is whether the Civil Court of Jefferson County [created by Act 96, 1965 Regular Session of the Alabama Legislature] has jurisdiction to entertain a suit brought by a Jefferson County resident against a Pickens County resident who lives outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Civil Court, when the Pick-ens County resident was properly and duly served with process but voluntarily waived his right to appear in court to raise the question of venue. We answer in the affirmative and hold that the judgment rendered by the Civil Court of Jefferson County was a valid judgment and not subject to collateral attack. We affirm.\\nAppellees may be divided into two groups: (1) The “court defendants” (E. David Hagler and Arnold Drennan, judges of the Civil Court of Jefferson County, and Joan Anderson, clerk of that court), and (2) the “corporate defendants” (Guaranty Pest Control, Inc., and its attorney, Lloyd E. Clayton) who brought the original action in the Civil Court.\\nAppellant entered into a contract with the “corporate defendant” in Pickens County. A dispute arose over the contract and the “corporate defendant,” á resident of Jefferson County, brought suit and obtained a default judgment in the Civil Court of Jefferson County against the appellant, who admits he was properly and duly served.\\nAppellant attempted to attack that judgment in the Circuit Court of Pickens County, but the Court held that it had no jurisdiction over the “court defendants” and dismissed them as defendants. Thereafter, following the answer of the “corporate defendants,” the Circuit Court dismissed the complaint as to them.\\nThe resolution of the main issue is concerned with a differentiation of the terms venue and jurisdiction. An analysis of the pertinent portions of Act 96, 1965 Regular Session of the Alabama Legislature (creating the Civil Court of Jefferson County), is essential to our inquiry.\\n“Section 2. . This Court shall be a Court of Record and shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the Circuit Court, Tenth Judicial Circuit of Alabama, Birmingham Division, sitting at Birmingham, and similar jurisdiction in precinct 53, which may lie outside the present jurisdiction of the said Circuit Court of the Tenth Judicial Circuit of Alabama, Birmingham Division, in all cases where the amount in controversy exceeds the sum of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) and does not exceed the sum of Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000.-00); . . .\\n“Section 5. This Court shall have jurisdiction of civil actions only and shall have no jurisdiction in equity or .\\n“Section 6. The territorial jurisdiction of this Court shall not extend over that portion of Jefferson County which is included in Precinct 33. The territorial jurisdiction of this Court shall extend over all other precincts in Jefferson County, except that specifically excluded here-in-above.\\n“Section 21. Any process from said Court, however, shall under existing law relating to service of processes from civil courts be legally served by a Sheriff of the county .... The processes from said Court shall be executed by the Sheriff of the County, or his duly authorized deputy, of the County in which such processes are to be served or executed.”\\nPart of the confusion arises from the various meanings which can be assigned to the word jurisdiction as the legislature has used it in this Act. Section 6 of the Act sets out the territorial jurisdiction of the Court. The words “territorial jurisdiction” in this context necessarily refers to the venue of the Court. The Alabama Supreme Court has used the words “territorial jurisdiction” to mean venue in the case of Woolf v. McGaugh, 175 Ala. 299, 57 So. 754 (1911).\\n“Territorial jurisdiction, or venue, may be waived, at least in personal actions.”\\nIn Section 2 of the Act the term jurisdiction is used to refer both to jurisdictional or territorial area and subject matter jurisdiction. We note that this section states that the jurisdiction of the created Court shall be concurrent with that of the Circuit Court of the Tenth Judicial Circuit of Alabama, Birmingham Division, and shall also extend to Precinct 53 which lies outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of the Tenth Judicial Circuit of Alabama, Birmingham Division.\\nAs used here, the term jurisdiction can only be interpreted to mean venue since the language indicates that the legislature was denoting the territorial area over which the Civil Court would sit when it extended this area to Precinct 53, an area over which the Circuit Court does not have venue. Additionally, since the subject matter jurisdiction of the Circuit Court is certainly not restricted to matters that are wholly within the Birmingham Division, it seems clear, both by implication and as specifically set out in Sections 2 and 5, that the legislature did not intend the subject matter jurisdiction of the Court being created to be limited to matters arising solely within the territory where its territorial jurisdiction was laid since Section 21 of the Act provides for statewide service of process.\\nBy reading Section 21 of the Act together with Title 62, § 184, Code of Alabama 1940 (Recomp. 1958), a local law applicable to Jefferson County, which states that “[t]he processes of all statutory inferior courts ... in the county, shall run to any lawful officer of the state and be served or executed by the sheriff (or his duly authorized deputy) of the county in which such processes are to be served or executed . . .”, it is apparent that the Civil Court of Jefferson County may serve its process anywhere within the State of Alabama and thereby obtain jurisdiction over a party properly served. Jurisdiction of the person is acquired by the court’s own action such as its process regularly issued and served. Lamar v. Commissioners’ Court of Marshall County, 21 Ala. 772 (1852); Woolf v. McGaugh, supra.\\nHaving thereby determined that the Civil Court of Jefferson County may obtain jurisdiction over a resident of Alabama by properly serving process on him, and from the stipulation of the parties that the appellant was properly and duly served, we conclude that the Civil Court of Jefferson County had personal jurisdiction of the appellant.\\nEven though we have concluded that the Civil Court of Jefferson County had jurisdiction over the appellant in this case under the facts as stipulated, this is not to say, of course, that the Civil Court of Jefferson County was the proper venue for this action since Section 6 of the Act limits the territorial jurisdiction of the created court to “all other precincts [Precinct 33 is excluded] in Jefferson County, except that specifically excluded here-in-above.”\\nft should further be noted that Title 7, § 54, Code of Alabama 1940 (Re-comp. 1958), provides:\\n“All actions on contracts, except as may be otherwise provided, must be brought in the county in which the defendant or one of the defendants resides, if such defendant has within the state a permanent residence; ... a summons issued contrary to this section must be abated on the plea of the defendant ”\\nThe Alabama Supreme Court speaking to this very point in Boudrow v. H. & R. Construction Co., 284 Ala. 60, 222 So.2d 154 (1969), held this section to be a venue statute which may be waived in personal actions.\\nThis proposition concerning waiver of venue was earlier laid down in Branch Bank at Mobile v. Rutledge and Watts, 13 Ala. 196 (1848), where a bill to enjoin a judgment was filed in the wrong chancery district, and a decree pro confesso was rendered on personal service, without any previous objection by the respondent, and the objection was first raised on appeal. This Court held:\\n“The bank must be considered as having waived the objection which it now for the first time makes. The chancery court had jurisdiction of the subject matter of the complaint, but merely exercised it in the wrong county. This was a matter which the court was not bound mero motu to notice, and which the defendant below could waive, and did waive by failing to raise the objection in that court.”\\nThe case of Woolf v. McGaugh, supra, quoted 22 Encyc. of PI. & Pr. 815, and notes, concerning the rule of courts generally as to the bringing of an action in the improper venue, as follows:\\n“ ‘It may be stated as a general rule that the bringing of an action in an improper county is not a jurisdictional defect, where the court has general jurisdiction of the subject-matter, and the statutes fixing the venue in certain actions confer a mere personal privilege which may be waived by a failure to claim it in a proper manner and at the proper time.’ ”\\nOn the authority of the preceding cases, it seems clear that the appropriate method to attack improper venue is to appear and make timely motion, and on a failure to do so the improper venue is waived and the judgment of the court rendering the final decree is valid and enforceable.\\nSince the Civil Court of Jefferson County had jurisdiction to render this judgment against the appellant, its final decree is valid and enforceable and on authority of Constantine v. Constantine, 261 Ala. 40, 72 So.2d 831 (1954), a judgment of a court which has jurisdiction of the subject matter and parties and possesses the power to render the particular judgment is immune from collateral attack. The proper place for an appeal from the judgment of the Civil Court of Jefferson County was the Circuit Court of the Tenth Judicial Circuit of Alabama, Birmingham Division, as provided in Section 8 of the Act creating the Civil Court. Therefore, the dismissal of the action against the appellees in the Pickens County Circuit Court was proper and must be affirmed.\\nAffirmed.\\nHEFLIN, C. J., and BLOODWORTH and McCALL, JJ., concur.\\nCOLEMAN, J., concurs in result.\\n1\\n. Also, see this ease for a good discussion of the classical distinction between jurisdiction and venue and the legal consequences incident thereto.\\n2\\n. The succeeding Section 55, which provides that action for work and labor may be brought in the county where work was done, does not change the result since the contract was performed in Pickens County.

       "       'text': 'JONES, Justice.\\nThis is an appeal from the Circuit Court of Pickens County, in Equity, which denied appellant-complainant John David Jordan’s request for declaratory and injunctive relief against the practice of taking judgments in the Civil Court of Jefferson County against non-residents of Jefferson County.\\nThe sole dispositive issue is whether the Civil Court of Jefferson County [created by Act 96, 1965 Regular Session of the Alabama Legislature] has jurisdiction to entertain a suit brought by a Jefferson County resident against a Pickens County resident who lives outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Civil Court, when the Pick-ens County resident was properly and duly served with process but voluntarily waived his right to appear in court to raise the question of venue. We answer in the affirmative and hold that the judgment rendered by the Civil Court of Jefferson County was a valid judgment and not subject to collateral attack. We affirm.\\nAppellees may be divided into two groups: (1) The “court defendants” (E. David Hagler and Arnold Drennan, judges of the Civil Court of Jefferson County, and Joan Anderson, clerk of that court), and (2) the “corporate defendants” (Guaranty Pest Control, Inc., and its attorney, Lloyd E. Clayton) who brought the original action in the Civil Court.\\nAppellant entered into a contract with the “corporate defendant” in Pickens County. A dispute arose over the contract and the “corporate defendant,” a resident of Jefferson County, brought suit and obtained a default judgment in the Civil Court of Jefferson County against the appellant, who admits he was properly and duly served.\\nAppellant attempted to attack that judgment in the Circuit Court of Pickens County, but the Court held that it had no jurisdiction over the “court defendants” and dismissed them as defendants. Thereafter, following the answer of the “corporate defendants,” the Circuit Court dismissed the complaint as to them.\\nThe resolution of the main issue is concerned with a differentiation of the terms venue and jurisdiction. An analysis of the pertinent portions of Act 96, 1965 Regular Session of the Alabama Legislature (creating the Civil Court of Jefferson County), is essential to our inquiry.\\n“Section 2. . This Court shall be a Court of Record and shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the Circuit Court, Tenth Judicial Circuit of Alabama, Birmingham Division, sitting at Birmingham, and similar jurisdiction in precinct 53, which may lie outside the present jurisdiction of the said Circuit Court of the Tenth Judicial Circuit of Alabama, Birmingham Division, in all cases where the amount in controversy exceeds the sum of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) and does not exceed the sum of Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000.-00); . . .\\n“Section 5. This Court shall have jurisdiction of civil actions only and shall have no jurisdiction in equity or .\\n“Section 6. The territorial jurisdiction of this Court shall not extend over that portion of Jefferson County which is included in Precinct 33. The territorial jurisdiction of this Court shall extend over all other precincts in Jefferson County, except that specifically excluded here-in-above.\\n“Section 21. Any process from said Court, however, shall under existing law relating to service of processes from civil courts be legally served by a Sheriff of the county .... The processes from said Court shall be executed by the Sheriff of the County, or his duly authorized deputy, of the County in which such processes are to be served or executed.”\\nPart of the confusion arises from the various meanings which can be assigned to the word jurisdiction as the legislature has used it in this Act. Section 6 of the Act sets out the territorial jurisdiction of the Court. The words “territorial jurisdiction” in this context necessarily refers to the venue of the Court. The Alabama Supreme Court has used the words “territorial jurisdiction” to mean venue in the case of Woolf v. McGaugh, 175 Ala. 299, 57 So. 754 (1911).\\n“Territorial jurisdiction, or venue, may be waived, at least in personal actions.”\\nIn Section 2 of the Act the term jurisdiction is used to refer both to jurisdictional or territorial area and subject matter jurisdiction. We note that this section states that the jurisdiction of the created Court shall be concurrent with that of the Circuit Court of the Tenth Judicial Circuit of Alabama, Birmingham Division, and shall also extend to Precinct 53 which lies outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of the Tenth Judicial Circuit of Alabama, Birmingham Division.\\nAs used here, the term jurisdiction can only be interpreted to mean venue since the language indicates that the legislature was denoting the territorial area over which the Civil Court would sit when it extended this area to Precinct 53, an area over which the Circuit Court does not have venue. Additionally, since the subject matter jurisdiction of the Circuit Court is certainly not restricted to matters that are wholly within the Birmingham Division, it seems clear, both by implication and as specifically set out in Sections 2 and 5, that the legislature did not intend the subject matter jurisdiction of the Court being created to be limited to matters arising solely within the territory where its territorial jurisdiction was laid since Section 21 of the Act provides for statewide service of process.\\nBy reading Section 21 of the Act together with Title 62, § 184, Code of Alabama 1940 (Recomp. 1958), a local law applicable to Jefferson County, which states that “[t]he processes of all statutory inferior courts ... in the county, shall run to any lawful officer of the state and be served or executed by the sheriff (or his duly authorized deputy) of the county in which such processes are to be served or executed . . .”, it is apparent that the Civil Court of Jefferson County may serve its process anywhere within the State of Alabama and thereby obtain jurisdiction over a party properly served. Jurisdiction of the person is acquired by the court’s own action such as its process regularly issued and served. Lamar v. Commissioners’ Court of Marshall County, 21 Ala. 772 (1852); Woolf v. McGaugh, supra.\\nHaving thereby determined that the Civil Court of Jefferson County may obtain jurisdiction over a resident of Alabama by properly serving process on him, and from the stipulation of the parties that the appellant was properly and duly served, we conclude that the Civil Court of Jefferson County had personal jurisdiction of the appellant.\\nEven though we have concluded that the Civil Court of Jefferson County had jurisdiction over the appellant in this case under the facts as stipulated, this is not to say, of course, that the Civil Court of Jefferson County was the proper venue for this action since Section 6 of the Act limits the territorial jurisdiction of the created court to “all other precincts [Precinct 33 is excluded] in Jefferson County, except that specifically excluded here-in-above.”\\nIt should further be noted that Title 7, § 54, Code of Alabama 1940 (Re-comp. 1958), provides:\\n“All actions on contracts, except as may be otherwise provided, must be brought in the county in which the defendant or one of the defendants resides, if such defendant has within the state a permanent residence; ... a summons issued contrary to this section must be abated on the plea of the defendant. . . . ”\\nThe Alabama Supreme Court speaking to this very point in Boudrow v. H. & R. Construction Co., 284 Ala. 60, 222 So.2d 154 (1969), held this section to be a venue statute which may be waived in personal actions.\\nThis proposition concerning waiver of venue was earlier laid down in Branch Bank at Mobile v. Rutledge and Watts, 13 Ala. 196 (1848), where a bill to enjoin a judgment was filed in the wrong chancery district, and a decree pro confesso was rendered on personal service, without any previous objection by the respondent, and the objection was first raised on appeal. This Court held:\\n“The bank must be considered as having waived the objection which it now for the first time makes. The chancery court had jurisdiction of the subject matter of the complaint, but merely exercised it in the wrong county. This was a matter which the court was not bound mero motu to notice, and which the defendant below could waive, and did waive by failing to raise the objection in that court.”\\nThe case of Woolf v.

       "       'text': 'OPINION OF THE COURT\\nAnil C. Singh, J.\\nDefendant moves for a judgment summarily dismissing plaintiffs notice of mechanic’s lien, contending that the lien was not timely filed in accordance with section 10 of the Lien Law. Plaintiff opposes.\\nDefendant Bernard Gould entered into a contract with plaintiff HamiltonAir Company, Inc., in August 2005. The agreement provided that plaintiff would furnish and install air-conditioning units in defendant’s cooperative apartment at 16 Sutton Place in Manhattan. The parties agreed on a contract price of $20,785, which included an $8,000 down payment. Plaintiff delivered and installed the air-conditioning equipment in September 2005.\\nSoon thereafter, defendant began to experience moisture accumulation problems on four units. Plaintiff attempted to solve the problem without success in September, October and November 2005. The defendant — who still had a balance of $12,785 — retained an attorney in November 2005, who in turn held the balance in escrow pending the resolution of the problem. Plaintiff returned to defendant’s apartment to attempt repairs again in July, August and September 2006.\\nOn January 12, 2007, plaintiff filed a notice of mechanic’s lien against defendant’s cooperative apartment in the amount of $15,022.38 (notice of motion, exhibit B). The notice states that the last item of work was performed — and the last item of material was furnished — on September 22, 2006. Plaintiff commenced the instant action for breach of contract and unjust enrichment on February 16, 2007. Issue was joined with service of defendant’s answer on March 7, 2007.\\nDefendant contends that a notice of lien must be filed within four months after the date of the last work performed or material furnished pursuant to Lien Law § 10 (1). According to defendant, installation of the air-conditioning units was completed in September 2005. Plaintiffs bill for services rendered provides that the invoice date was September 20, 2005, and that the bill’s due date was October 20, 2005. Defendant contends fur ther that plaintiff did not issue any other statements for services rendered after September 20, 2005. Therefore, plaintiff was required to file the notice of mechanic’s lien no later than January 2006. Since plaintiff filed the notice one year after it was due to be filed, defendant contends that the lien is untimely and, thus, invalid on its face.\\nIn response, plaintiff contends that defendant’s motion to discharge the lien should be denied for two reasons. First, plaintiff contends that, under Lien Law § 19 (6), the Civil Court of New York City does not have subject matter jurisdiction over the instant application. Rather, a motion of this nature must be brought in Supreme Court. Second, plaintiff contends that defendant may not submit evidence to contest the facial validity of the notice of mechanic’s lien. According to plaintiff, an evidentiary challenge to a lien’s validity, such as the one brought by defendant, must be raised during a foreclosure proceeding.\\nSection 19 (6) of the Lien Law states in pertinent part as follows:\\n“Where it appears from the face of the notice of lien that the claimant has no valid lien . . . the owner or any other party in interest, may apply to the supreme court of this state, or to any justice thereof, or to the county judge of the county in which the notice of lien is filed, for an order summarily discharging of record the alleged lien.”\\nThe New York City Civil Court Act enumerates the various actions involving real property over which the court has jurisdiction (Siegel, Practice Commentaries, McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 29A, NY City Civ Ct Act § 203, at 62). The Civil Court of New York City has jurisdiction of an action for the establishment, enforcement, or foreclosure of a mechanic’s lien on real property where the lien asserted does not, at the time the action is commenced, exceed $25,000, provided that the real property involved or part of it is situated within the county in the City of New York in which the action is brought (NY Const, art VI, § 15; NY City Civ Ct Act § 203 [e]).\\nThe question presented is whether Lien Law § 19 (6) preempts this court from having jurisdiction over defendant’s motion to summarily discharge the mechanic’s lien, notwithstanding the language in CCA 203 (e) ostensibly conferring jurisdiction on the court over actions to establish, enforce or foreclose such liens.\\nPlaintiff relies primarily on the “plain text” in section 19 (6) of the Lien Law, which states that a property owner may apply to the Supreme Court, any justice thereof, or to a county judge for an order summarily discharging a notice of mechanic’s lien. In addition, plaintiff cites Matter of Lowe (4 AD3d 476 [2d Dept 2004]) in support of its contention that Civil Court lacks jurisdiction over an application to summarily discharge a mechanic’s lien. However, Lowe is clearly distinguishable from the instant matter in that the petition to discharge the lien was filed in Supreme Court, not in Civil Court.\\nIn Geiger Roofing Co. v Thompson (54 Misc 2d 718 [Civ Ct, NY County 1967]), this court held that the Civil Court of New York City lacked jurisdiction over a motion to vacate a mechanic’s lien because Civil Court does not have general equity powers. However, we decline to follow Geiger because the reasoning of A.R.T. Ltd. v Simpson (114 Misc 2d 662 [Civ Ct, NY County 1982]) is more persuasive.\\nIn A.R.T. Ltd., an architect and cabinet work contractors filed a mechanic’s lien and commenced an action to foreclose on the lien. The defendant/apartment owner moved to dismiss the complaint, contending that there were fatal defects in the notice of lien and, therefore, the lien should be vacated and discharged pursuant to section 19 (6) of the Lien Law. The court held that the motion to discharge the lien was properly before New York County Civil Court despite the jurisdictional limitations imposed by the Civil Court Act. The court wrote:\\n“Plaintiff has submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the Civil Court by reason of the commencement of a foreclosure action. It would be illogical for a party faced with a foreclosure action to be barred from raising the issue of the defects in the notice of lien and be forced to bring on a separate proceeding in Supreme Court to discharge the very same lien that is the subject of the foreclosure action.\\n“Section 905 of the CCA provides: ‘The court may consider any defense to a cause of action or claim asserted by any party, whether such defense be denominated or deemed legal or equitable in nature.’\\n“The alleged defects in the notice of lien under section 9 of the Lien Law constitute an equitable defense in an action to foreclose on a mechanic’s lien and the owner of the premises may move in such an action to discharge the lien under subdivision (6) section 19 of the Lien Law. Therefore, the motion to discharge the lien under subdivision (6) section 19 for the alleged failure of the notice of lien to comply with section 9 of the Lien Law is properly before this court.” (114 Misc 2d at 665.)\\nTo the extent that plaintiffs’ cause of action in A.R.T. Ltd. was to foreclose on a mechanic’s lien, it is distinguishable from the instant action. On the other hand, the present action is clearly analogous in that the plaintiff has submitted itself to the jurisdiction of the Civil Court. Under such circumstances, we agree with the reasoning set forth in A.R.T. Ltd., that it would be illogical to require defendant to bring a separate proceeding in Supreme Court seeking to summarily discharge the mechanic’s lien.\\nAlthough cited by neither side, the case of Risicato v Lumberyard Supply Corp. (194 Misc 2d 770 [Civ Ct, Queens County 2003]) is instructive. In Risicato, the Civil Court addressed an issue of first impression — that is, whether Civil Court has jurisdiction to discharge an ancient mortgage, notwithstanding the plain language of a statute ostensibly conferring such jurisdiction exclusively in the Supreme and County Courts. The petitioner commenced a proceeding, pursuant to RPAPL 1931 (3), which provides: “Such petition [to discharge an ancient mortgage] may be presented to the supreme court in the county in which the mortgaged premises are situated, or to the county court of such county” (194 Misc 2d at 771). The petitioner filed the proceeding in the Civil Court of New York City, Queens County. Despite the language in RPAPL 1931, the court found that it had jurisdiction pursuant to section 203 (b) of the New York City Civil Court Act, which states that such court shall have jurisdiction “for the foreclosure, redemption or satisfaction of a mortgage on real property” where the property is situated in the county in which the proceeding is brought and the mortgage lien does not exceed $25,000. In determining that Civil Court had jurisdiction to discharge the mortgage, the court also relied on section 212 of the New York City Civil Court Act, which provides: “In the exercise of its jurisdiction the court shall have all of the powers that the supreme court would have in like actions and proceedings” (194 Misc 2d at 772).\\nThe language of the statutory provisions in the instant matter tracks the statutory language in Risicato. Thus, for similar reasons, we find that Lien Law § 19 (6) is not preemptive and that CCA 203 (e) is an independent source of jurisdiction to entertain defendant’s application to summarily discharge the mechanic’s lien.\\nHaving determined that this court has jurisdiction, we turn next to the issue of whether the court may consider defendant’s evidence to contest the validity of the notice of mechanic’s lien.\\nIt is fundamental that a mechanic’s lien may be summarily discharged only for defects appearing on its face (Matter of Di-Com Corp. v Active Fire Sprinkler Corp., 36 AD2d 20, 21 [1st Dept 1971]). Here, the notice of lien recited, among other things, the defendant’s nonpayment, and set forth dates indicating that the lien was filed within four months after plaintiffs last work on the job. On its face, the notice of lien states that “the last item of work ... for which payment was sought [was performed] on September 22, 2006.” The notice was filed on January 12, 2007. This is a facially valid lien (see Matter of Lowe, supra). Because there is no defect upon the face of the notice of lien, any dispute regarding the validity of the lien must await trial thereof by foreclosure (id.).\\nFor the above reasons, defendant’s motion to summarily discharge the lien is hereby denied.',\n",

       "       'text': 'CuRRiE, J.\\nThe relator Bornemann contends that he is entitled to the writ of prohibition prayed for by him on the ground that the civil court of Milwaukee county and the respondent Schultz, as a judge of said court, are without jurisdiction to vacate or grant other relief with respect to the two judgments docketed against Nickel on May 18, 1950, and June 2, 1950, respectively, because more than one year had elapsed since the entering and docketing of both of said judgments on June 5, 1951, when Nickel had the order to show cause issued by the respondent Schultz and served upon Bornemann.\\nSec. 21 of the Civil Court Act for Milwaukee county as amended by ch. 37, Laws of 1939, provides in part as follows:\\n“The said civil court shall have power to open any default judgment rendered by it within one year from the docketing of such judgment, except when an appeal has been taken. Said court, or the judges thereof, shall have the same power as the circuit court, or the judges thereof, to entertain motions, make orders, stay proceedings, vacate judgments, and to grant new trials and other relief\\nThis particular statute was before this court in the case of Greinke v. Midland Improvement Co. (1949), 255 Wis. 598, 39 N. W. (2d) 779, wherein it was held that such statute expressly vested in the civil court and its judges the same power as is vested in the circuit court and its judges by sec. 269.46 (1), Stats., which provides:\\n“The court may, upon notice and just terms, at any time within one year after notice thereof, relieve a party from a judgment, order, stipulation, or other proceeding against him obtained, through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect and may supply an omission in any proceeding.”\\nBornemann, therefore, is in error in his contention, that the one-year period in which the civil court, or its judges, might grant relief to Nickel from the two judgments is measured from the date of the docketing thereof, because under the provisions of sec. 269.46 (1), Stats., such”year is measured from the time that Nickel had notice of the entry or docketing of said two judgments.\\nBornemann, in his petition to the circuit court praying for the issue of a writ of prohibition, does not allege that Nickel had notice of the entry of the judgments prior to June 9, 1950 (one year prior to June 8, 1951, the return date of the order to show cause issued by the respondent Schultz), which allegation would be necessary in order to establish that the civil court, or the respondent Schultz, as a judge thereof, was without jurisdiction to grant Nickel relief with respect to the two judgments previously entered and docketed against him. The petition merely alleges that Nickel “knew” of the entry and docketing of the judgments without stating as of what date Nickel had such knowledge. In Bornemann’s brief it is stated that Nickel knew of such fact on June 9, 1950, because Nickel signed affidavits on that date setting up the entry and docketing of said judgments to support an order to show cause which was served on Bornemann on June 14, 1950, whereby Nickel sought relief from the judgments. However, this statement is not supported by anything in the record in this appeal, and even if it were true, the civil court would still have jurisdiction as of June 8, 1951, to have granted relief from the judgments, if Nickel had had no knowledge of the entry and docketing of the judgments prior to June 9, 1950.\\nIf the briefs of counsel correctly set forth the substance of the wording of the orders entered by the civil court on July 7, 1950, vacating the judgments on terms, it is unfortunate that said orders were so worded. It is preferable in wording an order vacating a judgment on terms that the order provide for the vacation of the judgment upon the terms being met, in this instance upon the payment of a specified sum, so that the judgment is not vacated until the terms have been met. In this instance, the judgments were vacated at once and the defendant Nickel was given two weeks in which to pay the sum imposed as terms, and upon his failure so to pay, the judgments were to be reinstated. The unusual nature of such an order is attested by the fact that the briefs filed by both relator and the respondents in this case cite no authorities on the question of a “reinstated” judgment, and we have been unable through independent research to find a single authority with respect thereto.\\nIt is Bornemann’s contention that when the two judgments were reinstated on July 22, 1950, they had the same effect as if they had never been vacated. The respondents contend that upon being reinstated they became new judgments and that the year period in which the civil court, or its judges, might grant relief with respect thereto should be measured from the date Nickel first had notice of said reinstated judg ments. However, because Bornemann’s petition for the writ of prohibition is defective in failing to allege that Nickel had notice of the entry of the judgments at a time at least one year prior to June 8, 1951 (the return date of the order to show cause served June 5, 1951), it is unnecessary to decide the issue as to whether the entry and docketing dates of the two reinstated judgments were May 18, 1950, and June 2, 1950, respectively, or July 22, 1950.\\nBornemann was entitled to have the judgments reinstated on July 22, 1950, if the payment of the $35 required of Nickel on terms for vacating the judgments had not been properly paid by July 21, 1950, the last date under the court’s orders of July 7, 1950, for the payment of the same. Whether payment of the same by check instead of cash and such check being for $40 and not $35, and whether proper payment was made by placing the same in an envelope and inserting the same in the mail slot in the door of Borne-mann’s office, constituted compliance with the terms imposed by the court orders of July 7, 1950, are questions which should receive the careful consideration of the judge of the civil court who may hereafter pass upon the pending application of Nickel for relief from the reinstated judgments.\\nBornemann urges as a reason why he will suffer irreparable injury, if the civil court, or one of its judges, should vacate or set aside the reinstated judgments, is that Nickel is likely to convey away his real estate as soon as the same is freed from the lien of said judgments, thus tending to render ineffective any subsequent judgment Bornemann may obtain against Nickel after trial had on the merits. We feel certain that the judge of the civil court who hereafter shall act upon Nickel’s pending application for relief from said judgments will give due consideration to this point. Under the provisions of sec. 269.46 (1), Stats., it is not necessary that the relief granted to one seeking to be relieved from a default judgment be a vacation of the judgment, as such relief can also take the form of an opening up of the judgment whereby the lien of the judgment remains pending the outcome of the trial on the merits. (See 31 Am. Jur., Judgments, pp. 318, 319, secs. 793, 794, where the distinction between vacating a judgment and opening up a judgment is discussed.)\\nNickel should have known shortly after July 22, 1950, that the judgments had been reinstated by Bornemann by reason of the fact that Bornemann had returned uncashed the $40 check of Nickel’s counsel which Bornemann found on July 24, 1950, had been pushed through the mail slot in his office door. The brief in behalf of Nickel in this appeal states that Nickel had actual knowledge of the reinstatement of the judgments in December, 1950. Nevertheless, Nickel waited until June 5, 1951, to take action to secure relief from the reinstated judgments. While this laches may not deprive the civil court, or its judges, of the right to grant relief from the reinstated judgments, such laches might well provide an additional reason for permitting the lien of such judgments to stand pending trial of the two causes of action on their merits, if the civil court does determine that Nickel is entitled to relief therefrom.\\nIn most cases, where relief is sought by a party against whom a default judgment had been rendered, the interests of justice would seem to be best served by opening up the judgment and granting a trial upon the merits, thus retaining the lien of the judgment pending the outcome of such trial, rather than vacating the judgment outright; but nevertheless this is a matter in which the trial courts are free to exercise their own sound discretion.\\nThe order of the circuit court dismissing the prohibition proceedings must be affirmed because, as hereinbefore pointed out, the relator Bornemann’s petition praying for the writ of prohibition does not state facts which show that the civil court of Milwaukee county, or any of its judges, was without jurisdiction to grant relief to Nickel from said reinstated judgments on June 8, 1951, the return date of the order to show cause issued by the respondent Schultz, as a judge of said civil court.\\nBy the Court. — Order affirmed.',\n",

       "       'text': \"Martin, J.\\nIt appears that deceased paid an annual premium of $56.88 on the policy of insurance in question from July 30, 1930, being the date on which Anders attained the age of sixty-five years, through the succeeding years to June, 1936. The insurance policy contains the following provisions :\\n“The insurance under this policy shall not cover any person under the age of sixteen years nor over the age of sixty-five years. Any premium paid to the company for any period not covered by this policy will be returned upon request.”\\nAppellant contends that the amount of the premiums paid during the period in question were so paid without consideration and should be returned in accordance with the provisions in said policy to that effect. The respondent contends, (1) that it waived the provision in the policy as to age, (2) that it paid a claim to Anders in the sum of $66 on March 15, 1932, for a paralysis of the face as a result of illness, and (3) that the insured was estopped to assert that the policy was not in full force and effect. Other contentions are made, but the view that we take of the issue upon this appeal renders references thereto unnecessary.\\nThe case was tried in the civil court in a somewhat piecemeal fashion. It appears that the case was tried in the civil court on September 29, 1938. Findings of fact and conclu sions of law were filed October 5, 1938. The court found that deceased became sixty-five years of age on April 30, 1932. After the findings of fact and conclusions of law were entered, respondent moved to reopen the case to permit further evidence as to deceased’s age. The case was reopened for further testimony and held open until November 17, 1938, on which date, on affidavit of one of the defendant’s attorneys, an order to show cause was entered directing plaintiff to show cause why the proof of claim and evidence of the claim paid to Mr. Anders on March 15, 1932, should not be made a part of the record. It appears that on the return date of this order to show cause, the attorneys for the respective parties stipulated that the death certificate of Mr. Anders be received in evidence. The court denied defendant’s motion to make the proof of claim and evidence of the claim paid to deceased on March 15, 1932, a part of the record. Thereupon the court made a new set of findings and conclusions of law wherein it found that Mr. Anders was born on July 30, 1865, and therefore attained the age of sixty-five years on July 30, 1930. The court further found “that while there may be some evidence of a payment for injury or illness made to Otto Anders after July 30, 1930, that there is no evidence and it is not proved that said payment was made for injury or disability which occurred after said policy expired by reason of said Otto Anders having attained the age of sixty-five years.” The court further found that the respondent Insurance Company never waived or altered in any respect any of the terms of its policy, and that there was no evidence of a waiver or intention to waive any of the terms of said policy, and that the policy by its terms expired when Anders reached the age of sixty-five years on July 30, 1930.\\nThe circuit court, in reversing the judgment of the civil court, said:\\n“Appellant’s counsel argues that this court may well presume that the disability in question [in settlement of which respondent paid Anders the sum of $66 on March IS, 1932] occurred after Anders was sixty-five. He bases that argument upon the policy provisions concerning the period allowed for making proof of loss and payment thereof.\\n“It is however considered here that where proof of a fact is so readily obtainable as was indicated by Mrs. Piehl’s testi-' mony at the trial, a conclusion should not be reached upon a presumption. The fact as to whether Anders accepted payment of a disability claim made by him for illness or disability, sustained by him after he attained the age of sixty-five years, is an important and perhaps a vital one in this case.\\n“In the interest of truth and justice such fact ought to be made known to the court. In order that such fact pertaining to said $66 disability claim may be ascertained it is necessary that further proceedings be had in the civil court (in the absence of a stipulation).\\n“Unless a stipulation be filed with the undersigned [circuit judge] within ten days after the date of this memorandum, which stipulation shall set forth the facts pertaining to^ said $66 disability claim, the judgment of the civil court appealed from must be reversed and the record remanded to the civil court with directions to reopen the case for the purpose of receiving evidence bearing on the matter of the said $66 disability claim paid by the defendant to Anders on March IS, 1932, particularly with reference to the time when such disability occurred, the duration thereof, the time when claim was made by Anders in respect thereof and other facts pertinent to said claim.”\\nThe appellant contends that the circuit court was without power to enter the order appealed from and, in support of his contention, cites sub. (3), sec. 28, ch. 549, Laws of 1909, under which the civil court was created, and cites a number of cases decided by this court as to the proper procedure on appeal to the circuit court from the civil court. However, counsel overlooks the fact that it was amended by sec. 2, ch. 399, Laws of 1935, relative to the procedure in such cases. The 1935 amendment reads :\\n“Upon an appeal from a judgment of the civil court to the circuit court, the circuit court may reverse, affirm or modify the judgment, and in case of a reversal or modification the circuit court may enter such judgment as may be proper. Where, however, by reason of manifest prejudicial error in the trial of the action in the civil court any party thereto' has not had a fair trial and where substantial justice cannot otherwise be done and the rights of the parties otherwise observed and protected, the judgment of the civil court shall be reversed, and the circuit court shall remit the case to the civil court for a new trial or further proceedings.”\\nWe think it clear that this statute authorizes the procedure followed by the circuit court in the instant case. The evidence sought to be obtained was relevant and material under the issues raised by defendant’s answer. If such evidence disclosed that Mr. Anders made a claim and received payment for his disability arising subsequent tO' July 30,1930, it would have a bearing on one of the principal issues in the case. The order made by the circuit court is one in the interest of justice :\\n“The granting of a new trial in the interest of justice is highly discretionary, and the supreme court will reverse such an order only in rare instances.” Besser v. Hill, 224 Wis. 211, 271 N. W. 921, and cases cited.\\nWe think the same rule applies to the order made by the circuit court in the instant case which reversed the judgment of the civil court and remanded the record with directions to reopen the case so as to permit the introduction of the evidence referred to in the order.\\nBy the Court. — Order affirmed.\",\n",

For necessaries furnished his wife a husband is liable only under special circumstances and conditions, and these must be pleaded in order to state a cause of action against him.\\n2. Under subd. 3, sec. 28, ch. 549, Laws of 1909, judgments of the civil court of Milwaukee county are not to be reversed on appeal unless it affirmatively appears that manifest error in that court deprived the appellant of a fair trial, and that by reason thereof his rights cannot he protected and substantial justice done without a reversal of the judgment.\\n3. No such prejudicial error resulted where, after overruling a demurrer ore terms to a complaint which failed to allege the necessary special circumstances to entitle plaintiff to recover for necessaries furnished to defendant’s wife, the trial court proceeded with the trial and found, upon the evidence, that such special circumstances and conditions existed, — there being nothing in the record to show that defendant was surprised by the court’s ruling or was unable to produce his evidence on those issues, or that he did not fully meet those issues with such evidence as he could command.\\n4. Appeals to the circuit court from the civil court of Milwaukee county should be taken in the manner provided by ch. 160, Stats., relating to appeals from justices’ courts; and the return of the clerk should contain the evidence taken upon the trial.\\n5. Where, upon such an appeal, the return did not contain the evidence, but the judgment was affirmed by the circuit court upon the minutes of the clerk and the findings of the judge of the civil court, such findings will, upon an appeal to the supreme court, be presumed to have been sustained by the evidence.\\nAbkeai, from a judgment of tbe circuit court for Milwaukee county: LawbeNce W. Haxsey, Circuit Judge.\\nAffirmed.\\nTbis action was begun in tbe civil court of Milwaukee county to recover tbe reasonable value of necessaries furnished by tbe plaintiff to tbe defendant’s wife at ber request.\\nTbe complaint alleges that tbe plaintiff and tbe defendant are residents of Milwaukee county; that tbe defendant is tbe husband of Bessie Grifka; that tbe plaintiff between certain alleged days, at tbe réquest of Bessie Grifka, furnished ber twenty-six weeks and four days with board and lodging and $12.50 in cash; that tbe board and lodging so furnished were reasonably worth tbe alleged sum; and that, although payment bad been demanded from tbe defendant for tbe value of tbe board and lodging and for tbe money advanced to bis wife, payment bad been refused. Tbe answer is a general denial.\\nAfter tbe first witness was sworn upon tbe trial tbe defendant objected to tbe admission of any evidence under tbe com plaint, on the ground that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a good cause of action. The objection was overruled, the defendant excepted, and the trial proceeded. The minutes of the clerk show that witnesses were sworn in behalf of the plaintiff and in behalf of the defendant and that they gave their evidence; that the hearing of the testimony took all of one afternoon and part, at least, of the next day (none of the evidence is returned as part of the record transmitted to the circuit court on appeal); that after the arguments of the counsel had been concluded the court continued the case for a week; and that at this time the court filed an opinion finding that the claim of the plaintiff was established by evidence and that the defendant was indebted therefor to the plaintiff.\\nThe findings of fact filed by the court state that the defendant and Bessie Grifka were husband and wife during the period during which the plaintiff furnished the wife with boarding and lodging; that the plaintiff was the father of the defendant’s wife; that for more than two months after the marriage of the defendant he and his wife lived at the home of the defendant’s mother; that two grown brothers of the defendant occupied the same house; that the members of the defendant’s family so conducted themselves toward his wife as to show plainly that she was not welcome in the house; that the defendant’s wife, prior to going to live at her father’s home and while she was there, repeatedly requested her husband to provide a suitable home for her; that he refused and neglected to provide any home for her except the home of his mother, although he was of sufficient financial ability to provide a home; that the defendant took his wife from the home of his mother to a hotel in the city, remained there with her for a while, but finally returned to the home of his mother, leaving his wife at the hotel; that the wife refused to go with him to the home of his mother, because of previous ill-treat ment and humiliation from the members of the family when she was there; that the defendant paid part of the expenses of his wife at the hotel, but withdrew his credit from her there and also notified stores in the city not to sell and deliver any goods to his wife on his credit; that the defendant’s wife, while visiting her husband at the home of his mother, was driven therefrom with a knife by one of his brothers; that the defendant’s wife was without money at the hotel and the plaintiff paid $12.50 to have her trunk released; that the do-fendant’s wife removed from the hotel to. the home of the plaintiff and was there furnished with board, lodging, and laundry during the time for which the plaintiff demands pay; that the board, lodging, and laundry were necessaries; that the defendant, during the period of his married life, had rather reluctantly given his wife not to exceed $40; and that the board and lodging furnished the defendant’s wife by the plaintiff were reasonably worth $5 per week.\\nThe court concluded as matter of law that the conduct of the defendant’s wife in living separate and apart from her husband and in refusing to cohabit with him at the home of his mother was justified; that the board and lodging furnished her. by the plaintiff and the payment of the hotel bill were necessaries; and that the plaintiff was entitled to recover the reasonable value of the board and lodging and the sum paid to the hotel.\\nAn appeal was taken from the judgment of the civil court to the circuit court for Milwaukee county. The clerk of the civil court did not transmit any of the evidence taken on the trial in the civil court, but the judgment of the civil court was affirmed by the circuit court on the minutes of the clerk and the findings of the judge of the civil court. This is an appeal from the judgment of the circuit court affirming the judgment of the civil court.\\nEor the appellant there was a brief by Arthur A. Mustier, attorney, and Julius 0.

       "       'text': \"SiEBECKER, J.\\nIt is manifest that the complaint was insufficient in that it failed to allege any of the special circumstances and conditions showing that the defendant was liable for necessaries furnished to his wife. A husband is not ipso-facto liable for all necessaries that may he furnished his wife. It is only under circumstances and conditions showing a necessity that they be furnished her hy others, such as his misconduct compelling her to leave him and their home, his wilful refusal to provide for her, or his deserting her, that the huS'-band is liable for them. Since the special circumstances and conditions creating such a liability are essential to a cause of action for such a claim, they must be alleged to constitute a good complaint in such an action. Brown v. Worden, 39 Wis. 432; Warner v. Heiden, 28 Wis. 517.\\nIt appears from the record of the proceedings had in the civil court that when the first witness called by the plaintiff to sustain his claim had been sworn, the defendant objected to the reception of any evidence under the complaint upon the ground that it failed to allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The court overruled the objection and ordered that the trial proceed. The question is: Does this error of the civil court require reversal hy the circuit court of the judgment appealed from ? It is provided by subd. 3, sec. 28, ch. 549, Laws of 1909, that\\n“Every judgment of said civil court shall be affirmed or modified and affirmed as so modified, by the circuit court, upon appeal, unless, by reason of manifest prejudicial error in the trial of the action in which such judgment was rendered, any party thereto has not had a fair trial thereof in the civil court; but iu any sucb case of mistrial, where substantial justice cannot otherwise be done and the rights of the parties otherwise observed’and protected, the judgment of the civil court therein shall be reversed,” etc.\\nIt is obvious from the context of this provision that a judgment of the civil court is not to be reversed upon appeal to the circuit court, unless, upon examination of the record of the civil court as returned to the circuit court, it shall appear from such return that “by reason of manifest prejudicial error in the trial” the appellant “has not had a fair trial thereof in the civil court.” It is also provided that “in any such case of mistrial, where substantial justice cannot otherwise be done and the rights of the parties otherwise observed and protected,” the judgment appealed from is to be reversed and further proceedings, as there provided, are to be had in the appellate court. It seems reasonably clear from the statute that the appellant was not, as a matter of right, entitled to reversal of the judgment by reason of manifest error committed by the trial court. It must furthermore appear in the circuit court that the manifest error resulted in an unfair trial of the action as to the appellant and that by reason thereof substantial justice cannot be done except by a reversal, and that the appellant’s rights cannot be otherwise observed and protected. The legislature, in dealing with this subject, evidently designed to mate it the rule that the judgment of the trial court should stand unless it should affirmatively appear, upon examination of the record, that the error complained of had such a prejudicial result that the appellant did not have a fair trial, and that by reason thereof his rights cannot be protected and substantial justice done him without a reversal of the judgment appealed from. It therefore devolved on the circuit court to examine the record and determine whether the error complained of had had such an adverse effect upon the appellant’s rights as required a reversal of the judgment. Obviously, the object of this procedure is to promote tbe ends of justice and obviate the necessity of retrials of causes on account of such errors, when the appellate court is of the opinion that such a technical mistrial did not produce a miscarriage of justice, and that substantial justice was attained by the judgment appealed from. Applying this test to the instant case, it must be ascertained whether or not the holding of the trial court in overruling the demurrer ore terms prevented the appellant from having a fair trial, whether or not it operated in such a way that substantial justice was not done, and whether or not the rights of the appellant could be observed and protected without a reversal of the judgment. The record shows that the trial court proceeded with the trial, after overruling the demurrer ore terms, and that witnesses were sworn by both parties and their evidence taken. No record of the evidence was returned by the civil court, but the civil court made its findings of facts upon the disputed issues of fact, to the effect that the special circumstances and conditions of defendant’s liability for necessaries of his wife were shown to exist. These issues were gone into on the trial and were determined by the court. There is nothing in the record showing that the defendant was surprised by the court’s ruling, was unable to produce his evidence on these issues, or that he did not fully meet these issues with such evidence as he could command in defense to plaintiff’s claim. Under these circumstances the error of the court’s ruling did not deprive the appellant of a fair trial; nor did the ruling against him operate to prevent substantial justice being done and his rights from being observed and protected by the judgment he appealed from. Under such circumstances the provisions of the statutes do not contemplate that the judgment should be disturbed on appeal. Since the evidence is not before us, it is presumed that the findings are sustained by the evidence adduced.\\nIt is to be observed iliac che return of the clerk of the civil court, pursuant to ch. 160,-Stats., should contain the evidence taken on tbe trial. Sec. 3763, Stats. (1898). Tbe procedure for taking an appeal from tbe civil court to tbe circuit court shall be in tbe manner provided by cb. 160 of tbe Statutes relating to appeals from justices’ courts.

       "       'text': 'Pee \\'Curiam.\\nPetition for writ of certiorari was filed in this Court to quash the judgment of the Circuit Court for Hillsborough County, dismissing a writ of error to that court addressed to a judgment in replevin rendered by the Civil Court of Record of Hillsborough County. The writ of certiorari was granted and the case is now before us on the return to that writ which has brought up the entire record in both courts.\\nJudgment for defendants was rendered by the Civil Court of Record on their motion for a directed verdict in their favor, which was granted. The purpose of the writ of error to the Circuit Court was to have reversed as error, the action of the Civil Court of Record in granting the defendant’s motion for a directed verdict, and in thereafter refusing a new trial. The writ of error was not considered by the Circuit Court on its merits, but was dismissed by that court as being insufficient in law to confer jurisdiction on it to review and reverse the judgment complained of. The question before us now is whether or not we shall quash the judgment of the Circuit Court to\\' which the writ of certiorari has been directed, or quash the writ which brings it here.\\nWe take judicial notice of the fact that the Civil Court of Record of Hillsborough County has been abolished by statute, effective December 31, 1931. See Chapter 14663, Acts of 1931. The abolition of the Civil Court of Record by operation of law also abolished the functions of the Circuit Court of Hillsborough County as a court of appeal having jurisdiction over judgments of the abolished Civil Court of Record, except as to eases already lawfully pending on appeal in the Circuit Court and undisposed of when the abolishing act took effect. See Salario vs. Latin American Bank, 104 Fla. 256, 139 Sou. Rep. 899.\\nWhere a writ of certiorari is improvidently allowed, it may be quashed on a motion brought for that purpose, or by the court of its own motion, in order to dispose of the case in accordance with law. In Re Lantis, 9 Mich. 324, 80 Am. Dec. 85. It has generally been considered improvident to grant the writ when it appears that substantial justice has been done, even though some irregularity of procedure has occurred. See Note 40 A. S. R. 30. Upon principle it \\'would appear to be proper that the writ be quashed, even after it has been granted, when it likewise appears that substantial justice has been done in the rendition of a judgment appearing in the return to the writ of certiorari, even if the judgment is irregular, where the entry of a regular and proper judgment will have the same result, as affects the rights of certiorari petitioner.\\nIn this case, even if there was fatal irregularity in the judgment of dismissal of the writ of error by the Circuit Court, as asserted by the complainant petitioner, a consideration of the case on its merits by the Circuit Court must inevitably result in a judgment of affirmance by that court of the judgment which has been rendered by the Civil Court of Record, and sought to be reviewed.\\nThe action of the Civil Court of Record complained of was the entry of judgment for defendants in a replevin case, pursuant to a directed verdict. The bill of exceptions shows that the Judge of the Civil Court of Record based his ruling granting* the motion for a directed verdict, on the ground that the evidence failed to show right of possession in the plaintiff. This view appears to have been arrived at by him on the ground that a bill of sale from W. B. Pogge, Trustee in bankruptcy, antedated by two months the appointment of a receiver in a foreclosure case, pursuant to a master’s sale in which, the plaintiff claimed.\\nThe exhibits referred to by the court as having been placed in evidence and used as the basis for his ruling, appear copied in the transcript, but are not so referred to\\' in the bill of exceptions or in the authenticating certificate of the trial judge appended to it, as to sufficiently identify the exhibits or to make them a part of the bill of exceptions in accordance with the permissible practice to omit copying exhibits in a bill of exceptions, provided they are so referred to and identified therein, that by reference to what the bill of exceptions shows, it can be made certain that the exhibits appearing copied in the transcript proper, are in truth and in fact the exact exhibits referred to in the bill of exceptions, as intended to be, by reference, made a part thereof. See Kidd vs. Jacksonville, 99 Fla. 1023, 128 Sou. Rep. 31.\\nSo it appears that because of the manner of preparation of the bill of exceptions, which under the circumstances did not appear to include all of the evidence upon which the court below directed a verdict, and denied the motion for a new trial, the judgment of the Civil Court of Record must inevitably be affirmed by the Circuit Court, even if we should quash on this writ of certiorari, its judgment dismissing the writ of error, thereby reinstating the ease before the Circuit Court on the merits of the appeal. See F. E. C. Ry. Co. vs. Buckles, 85 Fla. 416, 96 Sou. Rep. 397.\\n\"We deem it appropriate to say that eliminating from consideration any question of the technical insufficiency of the bill of exceptions to present for our consideration, the omitted exhibits which appear to have such a vital bearing upon the propriety of the ruling directing a verdict, we have carefully considered the evidence, and have failed to find any basis in the record upon which it can be said that the Civil Court of Record did not proceed according to the essential requirements of law, in directing a verdict for defendants and in denying them a new trial.\\nIt appearing, for the reasons pointed out in this opinion, that the judgment of the Civil’ Court of Record accords with the doing of substantial justice between the parties, and that this writ of certiorari, even if it should result in quashing the Circuit Court’s judgment dismissing the writ of error, would merely result in the affirmance of the judgment if considered on its merits, and that it therefore has been improvidently granted, it is ordered that said writ of certiorari be and the same is hereby quashed.\\nWrit of certiorari quashed.\\nBuford, C.J., and Whitfield, Terrell, Davis, J.J., concur.',\n",

       "       'text': 'Wingert, J.\\n1. The act governing the civil court, Milwaukee Civil Court Act, sec. 28.2, provides that appeals to the circuit court “shall be taken within twenty days after the entry of the judgment or order appealed from.” Since the appeal to the circuit court in the present case was taken within twenty days after the judgment was “ordered rein stated” on January 4, 1956, the question is whether the judgment entered November 18, 1955, was effectively vacated on December 7th. We consider that it was so vacated and that therefore the appeal taken within twenty days after its reinstatement was timely.\\nThe docket entry of December 7th is explicit that the “Court . . . now orders . . . judgment ordered vacated.” The context suggests that this was done because the motion for a new trial was taken under advisement, and the order of the previous day extending the stay of entry of judgment overlooked the fact that judgment had already been entered.\\nIt is the statutory duty of the clerk of the civil court “to keep in the docket of said court a complete and accurate record ... of all proceedings in any action or proceeding brought in said court. . . . Said docket shall be evidence in the courts of this state the same as the dockets and record books of other courts of record.” (Milwaukee Civil Court Act, sec. 11.2.) This court has said that evidence cannot be received to impeach the civil court’s docket record collaterally. State ex rel. Milwaukee Northern R. Co. v. Delaney, 166 Wis. 141, 143, 164 N. W. 825.\\nRespondent seeks to impeach the December 7th docket entry by pointing out certain features of the court’s written pronouncements said to be inconsistent with the December 7th entry that the judgment was vacated. Thus the trial judge’s decision of January 4th recites that judgment was rendered, but makes no mention of its vacation; and his order of January 13th recites the entry of judgment and the stay of execution and rescinds the stay of execution, without mention of any vacation of the judgment. We do not think, however, that the inference from any of these omissions is strong enough to impeach the plain words of the December 7th docket entry, “judgment ordered vacated.” We must therefore consider that on December 7th a verbal order was made, purporting to vacate the judgment of November 18th.\\nThe civil court had power to vacate the judgment it had entered nineteen days before. In actions involving over $200, “the practice, . . . judgments, and proceedings thereafter” in that court are governed by the provisions of law relating to circuit courts (Milwaukee Civil Court Act, sec. 14.2), and the court and its judges have the same power as the circuit court or circuit judges to vacate judgments (Milwaukee Civil Court Act, sec. 21.1). Sec. 269.46 (3), Stats., provides:\\n“All judgments and court orders may be reviewed by the court at any time within sixty days from service of notice of entry thereof, but not later than sixty days after the end of the term of entry thereof.”\\nExcept where an appeal has been taken, the civil court “may in a proper case and in the furtherance of justice, vacate, modify, or correct a judgment rendered in said court at any time within one year after the same was docketed.” (Milwaukee Civil Court Act, sec. 21.2.)\\nRespondent contends that the December 7th order vacating the judgment was not binding on plaintiff, and hence ineffectual to stop the running of the time for appeal, because no notice thereof was served upon or given to^ the plaintiff or its attorneys. State ex rel. Chinchilla Ranch v. O’Connell, 261 Wis. 86, 95, 96, 51 N. W. (2d) 714, is cited to that effect.\\nIn the Chinchilla Ranch Case, it was held that an order made at chambers vacating a default judgment, of which order the judgment creditor did not learn until the debtor had petitioned in bankruptcy nine months later, was not binding on the creditor and was ineffective to vacate the lien of the judgment. The court quoted from Yanggen v. Wisconsin Michigan Power Co. 241 Wis. 27, 32, 4 N. W. (2d) 130, that “An order of the judge at chambers is ineffective until notice thereof has been served upon the opposite party or his attorney. . . . For unlike an order made in open court, . . . such an order would not apprise the opposite party of its existence.”\\nThe principle thus announced is not applicable to the present case, for here there is nothing in the docket entry or elsewhere in the record to show that the December 7th order vacating the judgment was not made in open court. We must therefore presume that it was made in open court and not in chambers. Only “the court” is authorized to vacate judgments by sec. 269.46, Stats., or by Milwaukee Civil Court Act, sec. 21.2. When an order is authorized to be made by “the court” only, it must be done by the court in session. (Sec. 269.29.) It is to be presumed that the trial judge acted in the proper manner specified by the statute, i. e., made the order in open court, as an order of the court. If the fact was otherwise, plaintiff might have made timely application to the civil court to correct the record to conform to the fact.\\nPresuming- as we must that the order vacating the judgment was made in open court, the Chinchilla Ranch Case, supra, and others dealing with orders made at chambers are not controlling, and failure to serve notice of the order on plaintiff or its attorneys did not render it ineffectual to vacate the judgment so as to prevent the running of the time for appeal.\\nIt follows that the judgment was vacated on December 7th, and that the time for appeal did not begin to run until its reinstatement on January 4th. Volland v. McGee, 238 Wis. 227, 229, 298 N. W. 602. The appeal was therefore timely, and the order of the circuit court dismissing the appeal must be reversed.\\n2. The circuit court’s decision dealt only with the appeal from the judgment, and made no mention of the appeal from the order of January 4th, denying the motion to reopen. The formal order dismisses “the appeal . . . from the judgment of the civil court,” and nothing more. So far as the record discloses, the appeal from the order is still before the circuit court, and we need not consider it.\\nBy the Court. — Order reversed, and cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\\n1\\nAs revised and renumbered by ch. 266, Laws of 1953.',\n",

Soden, J.\\nThis is a motion for a change of venue pursuant to CPLR 510 and 511 on the ground that the convenience of material witnesses and the ends of justice will be promoted.\\nThe action was instituted in Civil Court of the City of New York, County of New York. Defendant Hoyt moves to change the venue from the Civil Court of the City of New York to Supreme Court, County of Franklin.\\nThe defendant, Hoyt, proceeds on the theory that the court has jurisdiction and that the motion was properly brought in Supreme Court, County of Clinton, Fourth Judicial District, State of New York. The plaintiff contends that the court is without jurisdiction because the motion must be made in the county where the action was instituted.\\nIf this were an action instituted in Supreme Court, a notice of motion would have to be held in the judicial district where the action was triable or in a county adjoining the county where the action is triable. (CPLR 2212.)\\nThe CPLR is applicable to all civil judicial procedures in all courts of the State and before all Judges except where the procedure is regulated by inconsistent statutes. (CPLB, 101.)\\nA change of venue is a legal procedure which applies to a court having two or more geographical divisions. In this motion, defendant Hoyt is endeavoring to employ a change of venue, not from one place to another within a single court, but the removal of an action from one court to a different court. The grounds for change of venue are set forth in CPLB 510 and are applicable to the Civil Court of the City of New York. However, the procedure as to which county in which the action should be commenced in New York City Civil Court is provided for in article 3 of the New York City Civil Court Act.\\nProcedure for a change of venue in the New York City Civil Court is governed by CCA (§ 306) rather than CPLR (511, subds. [a], [b]). It appears, therefore, that this motion should be initiated in the New York City Civil Court rather than Supreme Court. This court is without jurisdiction. (Fountainhead Caterers v. Peck, 42 Misc 2d 330; CCA, § 306.)\\nMotion for change of venue is denied.',\n",

Here, the Civil Court Judge who presided over the trial, expressly ruled that the landlord had not misrepresented to the court findings by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (hereinafter HUD) that the respondent Isaac Ausch had under-reported his income to remain eligible for HUD rent subsidies, and that the court had not relied upon any mischaracterization of HUD’s determination in concluding that Ausch’s subsidy had been properly terminated. The appropriate method to challenge the Civil Court’s conclusion would have been to file a timely appeal from the final judgment.\\nThe Civil Court also properly found that the application of Kenya Ausch to intervene was barred by laches (cf., Cohen v Krantz, 227 AD2d 581, 582; Dwyer v Mazzola, 171 AD2d 726, 727).

       "       'text': 'OPINION OF THE COURT\\nMemorandum.\\nOrdered that the order is affirmed, with $25 costs.\\nIn July 2012, plaintiff (the provider) commenced this action to recover assigned first-party no-fault benefits for medical services rendered to its assignor, who had allegedly been injured in a motor vehicle accident that had occurred on August 8, 2011. Defendant (the insurer) failed to timely answer or appear in this action, and instead commenced a declaratory judgment action in the Supreme Court, New York County, against the provider, among others, seeking a declaration that the defendants in that action were not entitled to recover no-fault benefits arising out of the August 8, 2011 motor vehicle accident.\\nAfter the insurer defaulted in the instant action, the provider moved for leave to enter a default judgment against the insurer. The Civil Court granted the motion, and a default judgment in the principal sum of $475 was entered against the insurer on March 6, 2013. In July 2013, the insurer moved to vacate the default judgment and to compel the provider to accept its late answer. The provider opposed the motion and cross-moved for “summary judgment.” The insurer did not oppose the cross motion. By order entered July 16, 2014, the Civil Court (Devin P. Cohen, J.) denied the insurer’s motion and granted, on default, the provider’s cross motion, stating that “the judgment stands.”\\nOn July 28, 2014, the insurer moved for “summary judgment” dismissing the complaint, contending that the amount due and owing pursuant to the Civil Court judgment had been satisfied, as an order and judgment in the Supreme Court declaratory action had been entered in the insurer’s favor on July 14, 2014, declaring that the provider, among others, was not entitled to recover no-fault benefits with respect to the motor vehicle accident at issue. The order and judgment further provided that the insurer recover from the various named defendants therein, including the provider, “costs and disbursements as taxed by the Clerk in the sum of $1,125.” The insurer alleged, in its motion papers, that the judgment in this action had been fully satisfied by virtue of a “partial satisfaction,” resulting from the judgment entered in the Supreme Court declaratory judgment action. Annexed to the motion papers was a document entitled “Partial Satisfaction of Judgment” which had been executed by the insurer’s counsel on July 28, 2014, and which bore the caption of the Supreme Court action. In the alternative, the insurer’s motion sought a “satisfaction of any entered judgment” in the Civil Court, pursuant to CPLR 5020 (c). The provider opposed the insurer’s motion. By order entered April 23, 2015, from which the insurer appeals, the Civil Court denied the insurer’s motion. We affirm.\\nWe initially note that the branch of the insurer’s motion seeking “summary judgment” was inappropriate because a judgment had already been entered against the insurer. However, the insurer also sought, in the alternative, a “satisfaction of any entered judgment” in the Civil Court, based on the judgment in favor of the insurer in the Supreme Court declaratory judgment action. Although reference was made to CPLR 5020 (c) in support of this branch of the insurer’s motion, this provision has no applicability to the circumstances herein. If the insurer was actually seeking the entry of a satisfaction of judgment, the proper way to seek such relief would be by way of a motion pursuant to CPLR 5021 (a) (2). However, in support of its. motion, the insurer did not demonstrate that it had filed a partial satisfaction of judgment in the Supreme Court action, in accordance with CPLR 5020 (a). Consequently, insofar as the insurer’s motion sought the entry of a satisfaction of judgment in the Civil Court action, such relief was properly denied by the Civil Court.\\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, it was apparently the insurer’s objective to have a portion of the judgment in the Supreme Court declaratory judgment action fully offset the judgment obtained against it in the Civil Court action. While a court may exercise its “inherent authority to set one judgment off against another” (see Joseph Kali Corp. v A. Goldner, Inc., 49 AD3d 397, 398 [2008]; see also Scianna v Scianna, 205 AD2d 750 [1994]), the granting of such relief rests in the discretion of the court (see Beecher v Vogt Mfg. Co., 227 NY 468, 473 [1920]; Kretsch v Denofrio, 137 App Div 617, 619 [1910]). Assuming, without deciding, that the Civil Court possessed the jurisdiction to entertain such an application (cf. Stilwell v Carpenter, 62 NY 639 [1875]), the Civil Court’s determination not to set off the judgments was not an improvident exercise of discretion.\\nAccordingly, the order is affirmed.\\nPesce, P.J., Weston and Aliotta, JJ., concur.\\n*\\nThe record indicates that an amended judgment in the principal sum of $475 (and in the aggregate sum of $939.90) was entered on August 15, 2014.',\n",

       "       'text': 'OPINION OF THE COURT\\nRolando T. Acosta, J.\\nPlaintiff moves to vacate a Supreme Court order issued on March 17, 1998. The motion requires the court to resolve a novel question regarding Civil Court’s jurisdiction: Does a Judge of the Civil Court possess the power under CPLR 2221 to vacate an order issued upon default by a Justice of the Supreme Court in an action which, although commenced in Supreme Court, has since been duly transferred to Civil Court pursuant to CPLR 325 (d).\\nBACKGROUND AND CONTENTIONS OF THE PARTIES\\nAfter plaintiff commenced this action in Supreme Court in 1996, defendants moved for, inter alia, an order granting partial summary judgment in their favor on plaintiff’s second cause of action. Supreme Court granted the motion on default and dismissed the second cause of action, plaintiff having failed to submit any opposition thereto. Soon thereafter, Supreme Court transferred the action to Civil Court pursuant to CPLR 325 (d).\\nUpon being served with a notice of entry of Supreme Court’s default order following the transfer, plaintiff promptly moved in Civil Court, pursuant to CPLR 5015, for an order vacating the default order which had been issued in Supreme Court eight months earlier. Plaintiffs motion to vacate is grounded upon the claim that plaintiffs failure to oppose defendants’ motion for partial summary judgment was the result of plaintiffs counsel’s “law office failure”.\\nDefendant, aside from contending that the alleged law office failure is insufficient to vacate the default order, argues that Civil Court “does not have the authority to vacate a Supreme Court order” under CPLR 2221. Instead, plaintiffs remedy, according to defendant, is to move in Supreme Court for an order retransferring the action back to Supreme Court. Once there, plaintiff would then be required to move to vacate the default before the Supreme Court Justice who signed it.\\nDISCUSSION\\nThe statute which delineates the rules regarding motions affecting a prior order of the court is CPLR 2221, which provides, in pertinent part, that: “[a] motion for leave to * * * vacate or modify, an order shall be made, on notice, to the judge who signed the order, unless he is for any reason unable to hear it”. (CPLR 2221 [a].)\\nThe primary purpose of the foregoing same-Judge rule “is to prevent one nisi prius judge from in effect sitting as a court of appeals over a colleague.” (Siegel, Practice Commentaries, McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 7B, CPLR C2221:1, at 178.) Such review by a Judge of coordinate jurisdiction would be “ ‘a breach of comity which, if sanctioned, could only lead to unseemly conflicts of decision and to protracting the litigation.’ ” (Collins, Inc. v Olsker-McLain Indus., 22 AD2d 485, 489 [4th Dept 1965] [citations omitted].) The unseemly conflicts, of course, are only exacerbated when the Judge reviewing the prior order is a court of limited jurisdiction (i.e., Civil Court) and the Judge whose prior order is being “reviewed” is a superior court of general jurisdiction (i.e., Supreme Court).\\nA corollary purpose of the same-Judge rule is that it “accomplishes the administrative goal of sparing the time and effort of Judge Two on a matter already familiar to Judge One.” (Siegel, Practice Commentaries, McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 7B, CPLR C2221:1, at 178.)\\nAn important exception to the same-Judge rule applies, however, when the prior order is issued upon “default” of one of the parties. Under such circumstances, the motion which affects the prior order, such as a motion to vacate, “may be made, on notice, to any judge of the court”. (CPLR 2221 [a] [1] [emphasis added].) The logical reason for the foregoing statutory exception “is that Judge One, who made the order upon the default, had no occasion to pass on the merits of the motion and is therefore not being ‘reviewed’ by colleague Judge Two.” (Siegel, Practice Commentaries, McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 7B, CPLR C2221:4, at 181.)\\nAlthough the foregoing default exception to the same-Judge rule is well recognized (see, Patron v Mutual of Omaha Ins. Co., 129 AD2d 572 [2d Dept 1987]; Juers v Barry, 114 AD2d 1009 [2d Dept 1985]), defendant contends that the exception does not apply here because Civil Court — a court of limited jurisdiction — is not a court of coordinate jurisdiction with Supreme Court. Thus, defendant argues, a Judge of the Civil Court is not a “judge of the court”, before whom plaintiff is required to make his motion pursuant to CPLR 2221 (a) (1).\\nThe court disagrees with defendant’s strained reading of CPLR 2221 (a) (1) and holds that in an action which has been transferred to Civil Court pursuant to CPLR 325 (d), a Civil Court Judge may, pursuant to the exception in CPLR 2221 (a) (1), vacate a prior order issued by a Supreme Court Justice where, as here, the prior order was issued upon default.\\nThe phrase, “a judge of the court”, is not defined in CPLR 2221 and nothing in the plain language therein expressly limits the default vacatur power to “courts” of coordinate jurisdiction. Nor do the rules of statutory construction dictate such a limitation. Indeed, defendant fails to set forth any authority — case law or statutory — which mandates such a limited reading of CPLR 2221.\\nFurther, defendant’s restricted reading of CPLR 2221 (a) (1) simply cannot be reconciled with the language of CPLR 326 (b) which clearly evinces the legislative preference that all further proceedings in an action transferred pursuant to CPLR 325 (d) continue in the transferee court. CPLR 326 (b) provides, in pertinent part, that once an action is removed to a particular court, “ [subsequent proceedings shall be had in the court to which it has been ordered removed as if the action had been originally commenced there”.\\nPursuant to the foregoing statute, once an action has been transferred, “the fiction arises that the action was commenced in the transferee court initially * * * [and] [t]he transferor court is thus robbed of all further jurisdiction in the case, and cannot hear subsequent motions.” (McLaughlin, Practice Commentaries, McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 7B, CPLR C326:1, at 591 [emphasis added]; see, Mears v Chrysler Fin. Corp., 243 AD2d 270, 271 [1st Dept 1997] [once Supreme Court transfers an action to Civil Court, Supreme Court effectively “ ‘loses all further jurisdiction to act’ ” in the proceeding] [citation omitted]; Graham v New York City Hous. Auth., 224 AD2d 248 [1st Dept 1996] [“By virtue of the transfer of the action to the Civil Court, the Supreme Court was deprived of subject matter jurisdiction and had no authority to conduct any further proceedings with respect to this case”]; see also, Mather v Ginsroe, Inc., 45 Misc 2d 674 [Sup Ct, NY County 1965].)\\nThus, the court to which an action is transferred is the proper forum for any further motions or applications, assuming that the motion is otherwise in compliance with the dictates of CPLR 2221 (a) (1). (Cf., Ministry of Christ Church v Mallia, 129 AD2d 922, 923 [3d Dept 1987] [even where the same-Judge rule would otherwise apply, the policy underlying CPLR 2221 (a) may have to give way to the policies of having one Judge do everything in the case under the Individual Assignment System]; Dalrymple v Martin Luther King Community Health Ctr., 127 AD2d 69, 72-73 [2d Dept 1987] [same].)\\nFinally, none of the goals of the same-Judge rule are compromised by this court’s review of the motion to vacate. The judiciary’s interest in comity, for example, is not jeopardized in the slightest since in this particular case Supreme Court did not pass on the merits of the motion which gave rise to the prior order. Thus, it cannot be fairly said that this court, by entertaining the motion to vacate the prior order, is improperly “reviewing” in any way the propriety of the order issued by Supreme Court. There is, in effect, no law of the case to review. (See, Newman and Ahmuty, Jr., Law of the Case Doctrine, NYLJ, Mar. 3, 1999, at 3, col 1 [“for the prior decision to be the law of the case, the issue must have been actually resolved on the merits”].)\\nIndeed, in his current motion to vacate the prior order, plaintiff is not even implicitly claiming that the Supreme Court Justice erred, factually or legally, in granting the unopposed motion for partial summary judgment upon default. Instead, plaintiff is alleging facts regarding his reason for defaulting and the merits of the dismissed cause of action — facts which were not, and could not have been, before the Supreme Court Justice when he dismissed the cause of action upon default.\\nFurthermore, there is nothing about the status of Civil Court vis-a-vis the status of Supreme Court which renders the default exception in CPLR 2221 (a) (1) less applicable when the court which is reviewing the motion to vacate is not a court which has concurrent jurisdiction with the court which issued the prior affected order. Since Civil Court has jurisdiction of this action pursuant to CPLR 325 (d), it simply does not legally matter that Civil Court may be a court of limited jurisdiction. Under these circumstances, this court’s review of the motion to vacate would not run afoul of the policy against having one Judge sit in effect as an appellate court over another.\\nNor are the interests in judicial economy served by refraining from reviewing the motion to vacate. Again, since the motion for partial summary judgment was granted on default almost a year ago and since the action has been pending in Civil Court for about a year, it cannot be said that the Supreme Court Justice who issued the default order is likely to be familiar at all with the facts of this action or the underlying reasons for the plaintiff’s default. Accordingly, the laudable “administrative goal of sparing the time and effort of Judge Two on a matter already familiar to Judge One” (Siegel, Practice Commentaries, McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 7B, CPLR C2221:1, at 178) would not be compromised at all by this court’s review of the motion to vacate.\\nIndeed, the goal of judicial economy and efficiency could only be furthered, not hampered, by this court’s review of the motion to vacate. The alternative to review — i.e., the route suggested by defendant — would be an administrative nightmare, causing the action to unnecessarily travel full circle, from Civil Court to Supreme Court and then from Supreme Court back to Civil Court, all in an action which Supreme Court has already determined, pursuant to CPLR 325 (d), would be more appropriately litigated in Civil Court.\\nShould this court rule, for example, that it does not have the power under CPLR 2221 (a) (1) to decide the motion to vacate, the court, as a preliminary matter, would have to grant plaintiff leave to move in Supreme Court to retransfer the action back to Supreme Court since this court — a court of limited jurisdiction — simply does not have the statutory or constitutional power to remove or transfer an action over which it has subject matter jurisdiction upward to Supreme Court. (See, CPLR 325; NY Const, art VI, § 19 [f]; see also, Sirota v Sirota, 168 Misc 2d 123, 124 [App Term, 2d Dept 1996].)\\nAssuming that the motion to retransfer is granted (and that the court file is duly delivered to the appropriate clerk pursuant to CPLR 326 [b]), plaintiff would then have to move again in Supreme Court for an order vacating the prior affected, default order. If the motion to vacate is granted, Supreme Court would then be required to issue another transfer order (consistent with the determination underlying its prior order), removing the action again to Civil Court pursuant to CPLR 325 (d).\\nThe foregoing procedural somersaults may be justifiable where the important goal of comity is otherwise jeopardized, such as where the prior affected order is not issued on default. Further, there may be other circumstances which would require this court to facilitate the retransfer of a CPLR 325 (d) action back to Supreme Court. (See, e.g., Huston v Rao, 74 AD2d 127, 130 [2d Dept 1980] [where plaintiff, in action transferred to Civil Court pursuant to CPLR 325 (d), seeks to amend the ad damnum clause, plaintiff must first move to re-transfer the action to Supreme Court and then move to amend in Supreme Court]; Gordon v Board of Educ., 134 Misc 2d 284 [Civ Ct, Kings County 1987] [same].)\\nIt makes absolutely no sense, however, to punt this somewhat routine motion into the procedural quandary of transfer orders, where, as here, no countervailing judicial or party interest would be advanced thereby. (Cf., Dalrymple v Martin Luther King Community Health Ctr., supra, 127 AD2d, at 72-73.) When all is said and done, defendant has failed to set forth any legitimate reason why this court should so cavalierly dispense with the dictates of CPLR 2221 (a) (1).\\nIn short, in view of the plain language and underlying rationale of CPLR 2221 (a) (1) and the clear mandate of CPLR 326 (b), defendant’s contention that this court lacks the power to vacate a Supreme Court order issued upon default is without merit. This court holds that in an action which has been transferred to Civil Court pursuant to CPLR 325 (d), a Civil Court Judge may, pursuant to the exception in CPLR 2221 (a) (1), vacate a prior order issued by a Supreme Court Justice where, as here, the prior order was issued upon “default”.\\nTHE MOTION TO VACATE\\nUpon receipt of the default order granting partial summary judgment to defendant, plaintiff promptly moved to vacate upon the ground that his failure to oppose the motion was due to “law office failure”. Plaintiff claims that he did not submit any opposition to the defendant’s motion because he believed, based upon a cursory review of the motion and counsel’s knowledge of a prior order which had been issued in the case, that the motion was merely seeking an order granting defendant leave to amend its answer to add a certain defense. Inasmuch as plaintiff did not object to the amendment which defendant sought, plaintiff did not oppose the motion. Unbeknownst to plaintiff, however, defendant’s motion also sought an order granting partial summary judgment to defendant.\\nBased upon all the circumstances of this case, the court finds that plaintiffs default was excusable and that plaintiff has set forth a meritorious defense to the motion for partial summary judgment and a meritorious cause of action. The court also finds, however, that defendants should not have to bear the cost of plaintiffs law office failure. Thus, given this court’s discretion to grant relief from a default order on such terms and conditions as the court deems fair (Rubin v Payne, 103 AD2d 946 [3d Dept 1984]), and given the strong State policy favoring the determination of disputes on their merits (Scott v Allstate Ins. Co., 124 AD2d 481, 484; Picinic v Seatrain Lines, 117 AD2d 504, 508), the court exercises its discretion and vacates the default order issued March 17, 1998. The court also awards to the defendants the reasonable cost, including attorney’s fees, of defendant’s opposition to the motion to vacate and the defendant’s submission of a new motion for partial summary judgment. If the parties are unable to agree on the amount of reasonable costs, the parties may move for a hearing related thereto.\\nAccordingly, plaintiffs motion to vacate the default order issued by Supreme Court on March 17, 1998 is granted upon the above-described terms.\\n*\\nAlthough the definition section of the CPLR provides that “[t]he word ‘court,’ as used in any provision concerning a motion, order or special proceeding, includes a judge thereof authorized to act out of court with respect to such motion, order or special proceeding” (CPLR 105 [g]), that provision does not aid the court at all in resolving the issue raised by the motion in this case.',\n",

The foreclosure complaint did not pray for a deficiency decree. The final decree of foreclosure did not reserve jurisdiction generally or expressly for the purpose of entering a deficiency decree. Foreclosure sale resulted in a deficiency amount. No application for a deficiency decree was made in the equity suit. Instead, the mortgagee filed the action in the civil court of record to recover the deficiency amount.\\nThe mortgagor Bradley and the other foreclosure defendants filed in the original foreclosure proceeding a petition for writ of prohibition directed against the civil court of record and one of its judges and the mortgagee. Rule nisi in prohibition was issued and subsequently made absolute, the grounds stated being that the civil court of record was (1) “attempting to act without jurisdiction” and (2) interfering with “the exercise of jurisdiction in the circuit court.”\\nProhibition may be directed to a lower court over which the higher court has appellate and supervisory jurisdiction. Appeals from the civil court of record proceed to the district court of appeal, and in certain instances to the Supreme Court. Art. V, §§ 4(2) and 5(3), Fla.Const., 26 F.S.A. Since the amendment of the judiciary article which became effective July 1, 1957, the circuit court has had no appellate or supervisory jurisdiction over the civil court of record. Art V, § 6(3), Fla.Const., 26 F.S.A. For that reason the circuit court was without jurisdiction to issue a writ of prohibition to prohibit action of the civil court of record. See State ex rel. Dato v. Himes, 135 Fla. 203, 184 So. 648.\\nNor was the prohibition order an authorized writ in aid of the circuit court’s jurisdiction in the foreclosure suit. Under constitutional authority granted to circuit courts to make “all writs necessary or proper to the complete exercise of their jurisdiction” (Art. V, § 6(3), Fla.Const., 26 F.S.A.), a writ of prohibition could be used to restrain proceedings in another court to which otherwise prohibition would not lie, provided it was necessary or proper to the exercise of jurisdiction of the court issuing the writ. Here there was no further jurisdiction to be exercised by the circuit court in the foreclosure suit which could be the subject of interference by the action in the civil court of record. This is so because no deficiency decree was prayed for or sought in the foreclosure suit; jurisdiction for it was not reserved, and upon the decree becoming final under those circumstances the equity court’s jurisdiction with reference to the matter was ended.\\nFor the reasons stated, the judgment in prohibition is reversed with directions to the circuit court to dismiss the petition without prejudice.\\nReversed.\\n1\\n.

At the time the judgment was entered, section 1474 of the Civil Practice Act (as amd. by L. 1962, eh. 695), so far as material, provided as follows: “ § 1474. Limitation of plaintiff’s costs by reason of bringing action in higher court. The plaintiff shall recover no costs or disbursements: 1. In an action brought in the supreme court, triable in any county in the city of New York, which could have been brought, except for the amount claimed therein, in the civil court of the city of New York, unless he shall recover six thousand dollars or more.” The amendment, which occurred during the pendency of this action, substituted the word “ civil ” for the word “ city ” and the word “ six ” for the word “four.” It is well settled that the right to costs depends upon “the statutes in force, not at the commencement of the action, but at its termination, or the time when the right to costs accrues ” (23 Carmody-Wait, New York Practice, p. 18 and cases cited pp. 18-23). The amendment to section 1474 did not except pending actions. It therefore applies to all actions and speaks as of the time judgment was entered (Dreyer v. Shapiro, 143 Misc. 170; Reisner v. 749 Broadway Realty Corp., 207 Misc. 76; Sicherman v. Yeshiva Univ., 39 Misc 2d 441). Although the amended statute refers to the Civil Court of the City of New York, which was not in existence at the time this action was instituted (cf. N. Y. Const., art. VI, §§ 15, 35, subd. a), in our opinion, for the purposes of this application, the Civil Court and its predecessor the City Court of the City of New York should be deemed to be the same court (cf. N. Y. City Civil Court Act, § 2104). Except for the amount claimed, this action could have been brought in the City Court; and, since the infant plaintiff recovered less than $6,000, he is not entitled to -costs (Sicherman v. Yeshiva Univ., supra). Kleinfeld, Brennan and Hopkins, JJ., concur; Beldoek, P. J., and Christ, J., dissent and vote to affirm the order, with the following memorandum : This action was not one which “ could have been brought * * * in the civil court” within the meaning of subdivision 1 of section 1474 of the Civil Practice Act as it read at the time of the entry of judgment on June 4, 1963, because there was no “ Civil Court ” in existence when this action was commenced on January 30, 1959. Therefore, the statute is inapplicable. The present Civil Court is not the same as the former City Court, as the majority holds. The Civil Court of the City of New York is a newly-created inferior court with enlarged jurisdiction. Under the circumstances, costs were properly awarded to plaintiffs (Klein v. City of New York, 234 App. Div. 455).',\n",

       "       'text': 'Order, Supreme Court, Bronx County (Irwin M. Silbowitz, J.), entered November 19, 1986, which, inter alia, denied plaintiffs’ motion for a stay of a Civil Court proceeding between the parties pending a determination of plaintiffs’ Supreme Court declaratory judgment action, unanimously modified, on the law and the facts and in the exercise of discretion, to grant the said motion for a stay and, except as thus modified, affirmed, without costs or disbursements.\\nPlaintiffs, a husband and wife in their 80’s, have lived for over 30 years as rent-regulated tenants in a building converted to cooperative ownership in 1982 pursuant to an eviction plan. The husband has suffered from Alzheimer’s disease for the past five years. In 1985, in the closing months of their lease, they learned, allegedly for the first time and with the help of their family, of the eviction plan conversion. Apparently, an agreement was then reached between their counsel and defendant’s selling agent that they would not be evicted at the end of their lease and, also, would be permitted to purchase the shares allocated to their apartment at the $68,112 insider’s price. The selling agent forwarded a replacement subscription agreement to plaintiffs’ counsel with a request that plaintiffs sign the same and return it with a check in the sum of $6,811.20 as a down payment. This was done. The selling agent, however, returned the agreement and check, advising plaintiffs that all offers were subject to the approval of the sponsor, who was unwilling to sell the shares at the insider price. At the expiration of plaintiffs’ lease defendant commenced a holdover proceeding in the Civil Court, where plaintiffs asserted two claims as both an affirmative defense and counterclaim. They argued that they are exempt from purchase as \"eligible senior citizens” as defined in General Business Law § 352-eeee because they had not received any notice of the conversion, and requested a declaration to that effect, as well as a declaration that they are entitled to specific performance of the agreement to purchase, which they had signed and returned. Eventually, the Civil Court dismissed the affirmative defenses and counterclaims on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction to grant equitable relief. Plaintiffs thereafter commenced this action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on the same claims they had previously asserted as affirmative defenses and counterclaims in the holdover proceeding. They simultaneously sought to stay the Civil Court proceeding pending Supreme Court resolution of their equitable claims. Defendant cross-moved, inter alia, for summary judgment declaring in its favor. The motion court denied both motions, finding, with respect to plaintiffs’ application, the Civil Court to be the appropriate forum for the resolution of their affirmative claims. This was error since the Civil Court had already correctly decided that it lacked jurisdiction to hear these claims. The Civil Court cannot grant declaratory relief. (Housing & Dev. Admin. v Community Hous. Improvement Program, 90 Misc 2d 813, affd 59 AD2d 773; see, CPLR 3001.) While the granting of such relief is always discretionary, the remedy would be available where it will serve to quiet or stabilize a disputed jural relationship. (James v Alderton Dock Yards, 256 NY 298, rearg denied 256 NY 681.) This is such a case. We modify accordingly to stay the Civil Court proceeding pending a determination of this action.\\nWe have examined the issues raised on the cross appeal and find that they are without merit.

       "       'text': 'OPINION OF THE COURT\\nMemorandum.\\nOrder insofar as appealed from by landlord unanimously reversed without costs and motion by tenant denied in its entirety.\\nThe issue on this appeal is whether the Civil Court is empowered to enlarge the 10-day statutory postjudgment cure period provided for in RPAPL 753 (4). For the reasons that follow, we hold that it is not.\\nRPAPL 753 (4) provides that in a holdover proceeding based upon a claim that the tenant \"has breached a provision of the lease, the court shall grant a ten day stay of issuance of the warrant, during which time the respondent may correct such breach.” In Post v 120 E. End Ave. Corp. (62 NY2d 19, 27) the Court of Appeals interpreted this provision as: \"in effect, authorizing Civil Court at the conclusion of summary proceedings to impose a permanent injunction in favor of the tenant barring forfeiture of the lease for the violation in dispute if the tenant cures within 10 days * * * To this extent the statute limits our holding in First Nat. Stores v Yellowstone Shopping Center”.\\nIn the Post case (supra), the Appellate Division had divided over the issue of whether the violation there in question — the improper use of a residential apartment by a doctor to see patients — could be readily cured within the 10-day period prescribed by RPAPL 753 (4). The majority ruled that the violation was not readily curable within the 10-day period so that complete relief could not be had in the Civil Court and therefore granted tenant preliminary Yellowstone relief. The dissent argued that such preliminary relief was unwarranted because the violation was readily curable within the 10-day period. On appeal, the Court of Appeals ruled that it was not possible to determine from the tenant’s allegations whether complete relief could be had in the Civil Court so that preliminary relief should have been denied.\\nThe assumption underlying all these opinions is that the Civil Court lacks the authority to extend the statutory 10-day stay. If the Civil Court had such authority, complete relief could always be had in the Civil Court and there would have been no issue as to whether the violation was curable within 10 days.\\nMoreover, in Wilen v Harridge House Assocs. (94 AD2d 123, 128) the Appellate Division, First Department noted that there are circumstances in which a 10-day cure period may be too short, such as \"where a subtenant or cotenant occupies the space and refuses voluntarily to remove”. The court stated that nothing in the statute empowers the Civil Court to extend the 10-day period. \"If the power exists outside the statute, there would have been no need for the statute and no basis for Yellowstone” (supra, at 128). The court also noted that according to the sponsor’s memorandum, the provision \"was designed to cover breaches \\'temporary in nature correctable within the ten day period’ ” (94 AD2d, at 130).\\nWe note that the Appellate Term, First Department recently ruled that where it is not feasible to legalize extensive alterations within the 10-day statutory stay period \"all that should be required is that the tenant commence to cure within ten days and to diligently and in good faith pursue such cure until the default is remedied” (Eighth-19th Co. v Scarano, NYLJ, Feb. 5, 1992, at 21, cols 2, 3). For the reasons articulated above, we respectfully decline to follow this rule.\\nKassoff, P. J., Joy and Scholnick, JJ., concur.',\n",

Battaglia, J.\\nPlaintiff Linden Chiropractic, EC. seeks leave to enter judgment on its verified complaint against defendant State-Wide Insurance Company, based upon defendant’s alleged failure to answer within the time prescribed by New York City Civil Court Act § 402. Defendant has cross-moved for an order compelling plaintiff to accept its verified answer as timely. For reasons that will appear, defendant’s motion is granted, and plaintiffs motion is denied.\\nPlaintiff served its summons and verified complaint by delivering copies to the Superintendent of Insurance at 25 Beaver Street, New York City, on February 17, 2005 and filed proof of service on February 22. Defendant was notified by letter dated February 28 from the Superintendent that the papers had been received on February 17. Defendant delivered its verified answer to plaintiff on March 23, but plaintiff returned it on April 6 with a letter rejecting it as untimely.\\nPlaintiff contends that service was complete on February 17, and that defendant’s answer was due no later than March 9. Plaintiff relies on New York City Civil Court Act § 410 (a) and § 402 (a). Section 410 (a) provides that service is complete “immediately upon delivery to defendant, where § 402(a) is applicable.” Section 402 (a) provides that “[i]f the summons is personally delivered to the defendant within the city of New York, it shall require him to appear and answer within twenty days after its service.” (Emphasis added.) As plaintiff sees it, the summons and verified complaint were “personally delivered to the defendant within the city of New York” on February 17 when the papers were delivered to the Superintendent of Insurance, and, therefore, service was complete on that date, and defendant’s answer was due 20 days thereafter, March 9.\\nDefendant maintains that service was not complete until February 22, and that its answer was not due until March 23. De fendant relies on New York City Civil Court Act § 410 (b) and § 402 (b). Section 410 (b) provides that service is complete “upon the filing of proof of service, where § 402(b) is applicable.” Section 402 (b) provides that “[i]f the summons is served by any means other than personal delivery to the defendant within the city of New York, it shall provide that the defendant must appear and answer within thirty days after proof of service is filed with the clerk.” (Emphasis added.) As defendant sees it, the summons and verified complaint were served by a means “other than personal delivery to the defendant within the city of New York,” and, therefore, service was not complete until proof of service was filed on February 22, and defendant’s answer was not due until 30 days thereafter, March 23.\\nResolution turns, then, on whether delivery of the papers to the Superintendent’s office in New York City constitutes “personal ] deliver[y] to the defendant within the city of New York” for purposes of New York City Civil Court Act § 402. The court concludes that it does not.\\nThe court notes in the first instance that, in their respective papers, both parties tend, at least on occasion, to use the terms “personal delivery” and “personal service” as if they were the same thing, when they are not. The difference is most obvious from a review of CPLR 308, which prescribes the methods of “personal service” upon a natural person. Subdivisions (1), (2), and (3) of CPLR 308 each describe methods that require “delivering the summons,” whereas subdivision (4) describes affixation and mailing, and subdivision (5) permits service “in such manner as the court. . . directs.”\\n“Personal delivery means ‘in-hand delivery’ ” (National Bank of N. N.Y. v Grasso, 79 AD2d 871, 871 [4th Dept 1980]; see also Fleetwood Park Corp. v derrick Waterproofing Co., 203 AD2d 238, 239 [2d Dept 1994]), and, so, for example, service by affixation and mailing as described in CPLR 308 (4) is not “personal delivery.” There can be no question that “personal delivery” in the sense of “in-hand delivery” was made here, because the summons and verified complaint were delivered in hand to a representative of the Superintendent. Nor can there be any question that the delivery took place “within the city of New York.” The only question, at least as disputed by the parties, is whether there was “personal delivery to the defendant within the city of New York.” The parties have not cited, and the court has not found, any decision on point.\\nAgain, the issue is not whether there has been “personal service” made on defendant in the city. Whether or not defendant is authorized, to do business in this state, personal service was made when the papers were delivered to 25 Beaver Street. (See Insurance Law §§ 1212,1213.) The difference between “personal service” and “personal delivery” is important not simply because the words are different, but because of the different purposes for which they are used. “Personal service” establishes the power of the court over the defendant; “personal delivery” in this instance governs the period of time in which the defendant must make its answer. (See, e.g., Deepdale Gen. Hosp. v American Colonial Ins. Co., 144 Misc 2d 917, 918 [App Term, 2d Dept 1989].)\\nThe meaning of the words “personal ] deliver[y] to the defendant,” as used in New York City Civil Court Act § 402 (a) and (b), seems rather clear and consistent with the logic of sections 402 and 410 of the Act. “Personal[ ] deliverty] to the defendant” means in-hand delivery to the defendant itself, and not to someone else as agent for, or otherwise on behalf of, the defendant. When the papers are delivered in hand to the defendant, there is reason to consider service “complete” (see NY City Civ Ct Act § 410 [a]), and to require the defendant to appear and answer within the shorter statutory time period, 20 rather than 30 days. But, when the papers are delivered, even in hand, to someone else for subsequent delivery to the defendant, there is reason to consider service “complete” upon filing of proof of service, an event more easily determined than actual delivery to the defendant, and allowing the defendant the longer statutory time period in which to appear and answer, 30 rather than 20 days. (See also CPLR 320 [a].)\\nThis apparent meaning is also consistent with CPLR 317, a provision that addresses related subject matter. The “parallel provision[s]” of New York City Civil Court Act § 2102 and CPLR 101 make clear that “the CPLR is to govern civil practice and procedure ... to the extent that it is not inconsistent with the procedure of the individual courts as described in their court acts.” (See Ling Ling Yung v County of Nassau, 77 NY2d 568, 572 [1991].) The provisions of the CPLR are sufficiently related to those of the New York City Civil Court Act that they should be considered virtually the same statute for purposes of the rule of statutory construction that looks to all the provisions of the statute as an aid to the meaning of any one. (See McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes § 97.)\\nCPLR 317 allows a defendant who has not appeared in an action within the required period, and who was “served with a summons other than by personal delivery to him or to his agent for service designated under rule 318,” to defend the action upon findings by the court that the defendant “did not personally receive notice of the summons in time to defend and has a meritorious defense.” The relationship of CPLR 317 to New York City Civil Court Act § 402 is obvious, in that it in effect establishes justification for failure to appear as required by section 402 when the defendant does not “personally receive notice of the summons in time” because of service “other than by personal delivery to him or to his agent.”\\nOn its face, CPLR 317 provides some evidence of the intended meaning of New York City Civil Court Act § 402 by making a distinction between in-hand delivery to the defendant itself and in-hand delivery to a designated agent. New York City Civil Court Act § 402 makes no such distinction, speaking only of delivery “to the defendant.” And, for purposes of CPLR 317, an individual who is not served pursuant to CPLR 308 (1) or (3)— even when service is made by “delivering the summons ... to a person of suitable age and discretion” pursuant to CPLR 308 (2) — may obtain relief from its failure to timely answer. (See Concepcion v Talon Realty Corp., 258 AD2d 494 [2d Dept 1999]; Essex Credit Corp. v Tarantini Assoc., 179 AD2d 973, 973-974 [3d Dept 1992].) The implication is clear; “personal delivery to him,” the defendant, does not include personal delivery to someone else for subsequent delivery to the defendant.\\nEven if, however, the phrase “personal ] deliverty] to the defendant” as used in New York City Civil Court Act § 402 is understood to mean “personal delivery ... to [the defendant] or to his agent for service designated under rule 318,” plaintiffs contention must fail. It is well established that “service on a corporation through delivery of process to the Secretary of State is not ‘personal delivery’ to the corporation or to an agent designated [for service] under CPLR 318.” (Eugene Di Lorenzo, Inc. v A.C. Dutton Lbr. Co., 67 NY2d 138, 142 [1986]; see also Calderon v 163 Ocean Tenants Corp., 27 AD3d 410 [2d Dept 2006].)\\nPlaintiff attempts to distinguish this authority by limiting it to service on the Secretary of State, rather than the Superintendent of Insurance. Its contention, however, is somewhat undermined by Appellate Term’s decision in Deepdale Gen. Hosp. v American Colonial Ins. Co. (144 Misc 2d at 918). The court stated that, under section 410 of the UDCA, which is identical to New York City Civil Court Act § 410 in its reference to section 402, service on an insurer by delivery to the Superintendent of Insurance is not complete until proof of service is filed. (See id.)\\nThe provisions of Uniform District Court Act § 402, however, are different than those of New York City Civil Court Act § 402. Section 402 (a) of the UDCA requires an answer within 20 days after service if the summons is “personally served within the county on a natural person pursuant to CPLR § 308(1), or on a corporation pursuant to CPLR § 311(1) [sic].” Service pursuant to CPLR 308 (1) is made “by delivering the summons ... to the person to be served.” Service pursuant to CPLR 311 (a) (1) is made by “delivering the summons ... to an officer ... or assistant cashier or to any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service.” Section 402 (b) of the UDCA requires an answer within 30 days after proof of service is filed if the summons is “served otherwise than as designated in subdivision (a).” Note that section 402 of the Uniform District Court Act speaks of “personal service,” whereas section 402 of the New York City Civil Court Act speaks of “personal [ ] deliver [y].”\\nThe provisions of Uniform District Court Act § 402 (a) support this court’s interpretation of New York City Civil Court Act § 402 (a) to the extent that, when service is made on an individual, the shorter 20-day period for answer is limited to personal delivery to the defendant. On the other hand, when service is made on a corporation, the 20-day period for answer also applies when delivery is made “to any . . . agent authorized by . . . law to receive service.” (CPLR 311 [a] [1].) That would appear to include the Superintendent of Insurance. (See Insurance Law §§ 1212, 1213; see also Fred S. James & Co. v Second Russian Ins. Co., 208 App Div 141, 143 [1st Dept 1924]; Diagnostic Rehab. Medicine Serv. v Republic W. Ins. Co., 2003 NY Slip Op 51458[U], *11-19 [Civ Ct, Kings County 2003].) It is not clear why Appellate Term apparently concluded that, when service is made on the Superintendent of Insurance, “service is not complete until the summons is filed with the court.” (Deepdale Gen. Hosp. v American Colonial Ins. Co., 144 Misc 2d at 918.)\\nFinally, there is CPLR 320, which prescribes the time for the defendant’s appearance in Supreme Court. Appearance is generally required “within twenty days after service of the summons, except that if the summons was served on the defendant by delivering it to an official of the state authorized to receive service in his behalf . . . , the appearance shall be made within thirty days after service is complete.” (CPLR 320 [a].) The logic of this provision, allowing a longer time when service is made by delivery to a state official than when service is made to the defendant itself, is obviously consistent with this court’s reading of New York City Civil Court Act § 402.\\nThis court concludes that “personal! ] deliver[y] to the defendant within the city of New York,” as used in New York City Civil Court Act § 402, means personal delivery to the defendant itself within the city, and not to the office of a statutory agent; and that, therefore, service based on delivery to a statutory agent is complete when proof of service is filed, so that the defendant’s answer is not due until 30 days after filing. (See NY City Civ Ct Act §§ 402, 410.) If the result would be different under the Uniform District Court Act, it might be explained by the lynchpin of personal service in that statute, as compared to personal delivery in the New York City Civil Court Act, but is insufficient in any event to overcome the plain meaning of section 402 of the New York City Civil Court Act and the other evidence of legislative intent described above.\\nThe defendant’s verified answer was, therefore, timely served.',\n",

       "       'text': 'In a proceeding to remove a personal injury action from the Civil Court of the .City of New York to the Supreme Court and for leave to amend the complaint in said action, the appeal is from an order of the Supreme Court, Kings County, dated October 6, 1970, which granted the application, except that appellant has excluded from the appeal so much of the order as directed that the ad damnum shall not be increased. Order reversed insofar as appealed from, with $10 costs and disbursements, and application denied, without prejudice to an application in the Civil Court of the City of New York, Kings County, to amend the complaint. Plaintiff instituted the suit in the Civil Court, Kings County, in December, 1966. The oral complaint alleges his cause of action in the following language: “ Action in the sum of $10,000, for damages for personal injuries sustained on the 30th day of October, 1966, while lawfully upon defendant’s premises located at 1011 Bedford Avenue, Brooklyn, New York, as a business invitee of the defendant. Defendant was negligent in the ownership, operation, maintenance and control of said premises. Plaintiff was free from contributory negligence.” The order appealed from granted plaintiff’s motion to remove his cause from the Civil Court to the Supreme Court and permitted an amendment to his complaint to set forth an additional cause of action under section 11-101 of the General Obligations Law, which permits a recovery of punitive damages in addition to compensatory damages. The Special Term denied that portion of the motion which sought to increase the ad damnum clause relating to his personal injury cause of action to the sum of $50,000. Implicit in the denial of an increase in the ad damnum clause is a finding by Special Term that plaintiff could be adequately compensated for his actual damages by an amount within the jurisdictional limits of the Civil Court. Under the circumstances, in our opinion, it was an abuse of discretion to permit the transfer of plaintiff’s cause from the Civil Court to the Supreme Court merely to permit him to allege a new cause of action under section 11-101 of the General Obligations Law, particularly in view of the fact that the motion was not made until more than 3% years after joinder of issue in the action. Plaintiff may, of course, move in the Civil Court to amend his complaint to include a cause of action under the General .Obligations Law. Rabin, P.

       "       'text': 'The plaintiff Albert Lewis, in his complaint, alleges that he has been caused to suffer emotional distress as the result of having been served with a summons and complaint in a separate action brought against him by the defendant, Pay Television of Greater New York, Inc. (hereinafter Pay Television), in the Civil Court of the City of New York. The action in the Civil Court is premised upon allegations that Mr. Lewis has illegally intercepted and received microwave transmissions emitted by Pay Television. Mr. Lewis further alleges that Pay Television commenced the Civil Court action in order to \"intimidate, confuse and threaten” him, and has commenced similar legal actions against nearly 1,000 other members of the \"unsuspecting public”. Pay Television made a motion to dismiss the complaint, which was denied. We reverse and grant the motion to dismiss.\\nThere is no cause of action to recover damages for abuse of process unless the process complained of involves \" \\'an unlawful interference with one’s person or property’ ” (Curiano v Suozzi, 63 NY2d 113, 116, quoting from Williams v Williams, 23 NY2d 592, 596; Rebore v Pace, 115 AD2d 468). The mere issuance of a summons and complaint is therefore insufficient to support a claim for abuse of process (Curiano v Suozzi, supra; Weisman v Weisman, 108 AD2d 853; James v Saltsman, 99 AD2d 797). Thus, the plaintiff’s complaint to recover damages for abuse of process based on the Civil Court summons and complaint fails to state a cause of action (CPLR 3211 [a] [7]).\\nIn light of this determination, the issue of whether the plaintiff may assert his cause of action to recover damages for abuse of process as the representative of a class consisting of all persons sued by the defendant in the Civil Court is academic. We also find that there is no merit to the defendant’s request that it be permitted to interpose a counterclaim against all the members of the plaintiff’s proposed class (including Lewis), and, in addition, all other suspected cable television \"pirates” who have not yet been sued in the Civil Court. Such relief is entirely unwarranted where the defendant’s position is that the plaintiff is not qualified to represent the class. Such relief is also unwarranted in light of the fact that the defendant has already commenced hundreds of Civil Court actions against the individuals (including Lewis) whom it now seeks to sue as a class (see, CPLR 902 [3]).\\nAccordingly, we reverse so much of the order of Justice Lodato as permitted the defendant to assert such a counterclaim.

Respondents moved initially to dismiss the present action for failure to state a cause of action upon grounds that petitioners are not aggrieved parties and lack standing to sue. This court denied that motion on the argument and directed the service of an answer. Issue is now joined and the substantive issues of this controversy are before the court.\\nThe answer reiterates the defense that the petitioners lack standing to compel appropriation of funds for the Housing Part of the Civil Court. In addition, the respondents contend that the petitioners have not followed those procedures mandated by section 211 (subd. 2, par. [k]) of the Judiciary Law and that any budget modifications in excess of those funds already allocated to the courts are solely within the discretion of the Mayor, the City Council and the Board of Estimate.\\nOn June 8, 1972, the Legislature amended the New York City Civil Court Act, the Administrative Code and the Multiple Dwelling Law in relation to the creation of the aforesaid Housing Part (loosely dubbed the Housing Court by some) for the trial of violations of State and local Housing Acts (L. 1972, ch. 982; CCA, § 110). This act was designed to shift the responsibility for the enforcement of housing violations in New York City from the Criminal Court to this specially created Part of the Civil Court. Hopefully, the transfer of enforcement to the Civil Court will alleviate the burden upon the crowded Criminal Court and afford the public a more expeditious and effective method of building code enforcement. Governor [Rockefeller, recognizing the need and urgency of the legislation, called for the implementation of the new system by April 1, 1973, and urged that the advance preparations begin promptly after passage of the enabling act (N. Y. Legis. Annual, 1972, Governor’s Memoranda, p. 373). It is evident, however, that heed was not given to the Governor’s plea for haste in this matter.\\nCommunications between the executive and judicial branches of the city government have deteriorated to such an extent that this lawsuit has become necessary to determine how and when the Housing Part is to be funded.\\nProcedurally, there is no doubt that the petitioners have standing to bring the instant proceeding and they are aggrieved parties. In accord with the doctrine of the separation of powers, the judiciary is and shall remain a separate, independent and coequal branch of government with the executive and legislative. The judiciary has the right and power to protect itself from the impairment of its functions and it has the co-ordinate authority to make full use of its jurisdiction. (Commonwealth ex rel. Carroll v. Tate, 442 Pa. 45, cert. den. 402 U. S. 974; see, also, 20 Am. Jur. 2d, Courts, § 79). Pursuant to legislative fiat, the Civil Court has been granted an extension of jurisdiction. Consequently, the State Judicial Conference, together with the Civil Court, has the legal and constitutional right and obligation to insist that the new jurisdiction be given effect.\\nClearly, the question presented to this court is whether the executive branch of government, by the exercise or nonexercise of .its appropriating powers can impede or frustrate the courts from realizing their lawful jurisdiction and, simultaneously, flout a legislative mandate enacted June 8, 1972.\\nSection 29 of article VI of the Constitution of the State of New York permits the annual financial needs of the courts to be determined by the appropriate governing bodies. This power is relegated to that of review of the budget estimates submitted to it, but the capacity to review does not carry with it the power to share the responsibility of court administration (Matter of Serra v. Procaccino, 33 A D 2d 210, revd. on other grounds 27 N Y 2d 162). Nor is the executive branch given concomitant inherent ability to destroy by the withholding of an appropria tion (cf. Matter of Colbert v. Delaney, 249 App. Div. 209, 216; Matter of McKinney v. McGoldrick, 243 App. Div. 210, 213, affd. 266 N. Y. 632, rearg. den. 266 N. Y. 665).\\nIn opposing the arguments advanced hy the petitioners, the Corporation Counsel, on behalf of the respondents, seeks to restrict the city’s responsibility to a final determination of the budgetary sums to be allotted to the courts, while ignoring the corresponding duty of the city to appropriate adequate sums for the continued operation of the court system. There is no question that by the 1962 amendment to the New York State Constitution, the courts lost their mandatory budgetary powers and are now required to submit to a review of their monetary needs by the city prior to appropriation. By the same amendment, the city was not relieved of its obligation to furnish the necessary funds as required by the courts for their functioning in the proper discharge of the constitutional requirement to operate an efficient system of justice.\\nThe city’s position that it is now vested with ££ discretion to appropriate or not to appropriate ’ ’ funds is a brash attempt to extend the respondents’ authority which has no foundation in logic or in law. The arrest of the court’s earlier power to mandate all of its costs of operation never sanctioned or reposed complete authority in the respondents to cut off all funds for the courts within the City of New York. Such a grasp of power is both illegal and unconstitutional (N. Y. Const., art. \"VT, § 29, subd. d; Judiciary Law, § 213, subd. 7; Matter of Henderson v. La Guardia, 182 Misc. 1071, affd. 268 App. Div. 892, affd. 294 N. Y. 728).\\nThe duty to fund cannot be avoided or subverted because budgetary modifications or future appropriations entail some degree of discretion. Discretion may not be abused or converted into a subterfuge to exercise a de facto veto over legislative enactment. (Matter of Colbert v. Delaney, 249 App. Div. 209, supra.) The anomaly, however, in this situation is that the respondents plainly stated on the argument in this court that they not only recognize the need for the so-called ££ Housing Court ” but wholeheartedly approved its establishment. Respondents certainly have discretion concerning the extent of the budgetary allotment, but again they may not radically exercise the fiscal estimates to a degree that would debilitate the courts, or a part thereof, and render them anemic or impotent. The limits of respondents’ discretion are constitutionally proscribed (Commonwealth ex rel. Carroll v. Tate, 442 Pa. 45, cert. den. 402 U. S. 974, supra). Furthermore, it is of no critical interest to the respondents that the Civil Court chooses, within limits of the enactment, to designate hearing officers, their numbers, function, salary, or the deployment thereof. Those considerations are resident in the courts by statute and as a matter of inherent right (Judiciary Law, § 212; Matter of Serra v. Procaccino, 33 A D 2d 210, revd. on other grounds 27 N Y 2d 162, supra). Nor is it a substantial obstruction to relief that normal budgetary procedures were not complied with in this instance (Judiciary Law, § 213, subd. 7). Despite the existence of established budgetary procedures, budget appropriations for the courts for all practical purposes are lump sum allocations (see City Record, Supplement, Yol. XC III, No. 27927, June 23, 1965, p. 60). \\'\\nIf the petitioners did not follow the ordinary procedures to obtain a modification of the city’s 1972-1973 budget to procure the funds for the period from April 1, 1973 through June 30, 1973, the respondents nevertheless do not deny that they were on written notice beginning in November, 1972, that city funds were needed for the new Housing Part of the Civil Court. It must be remembered that the Civil Court apparently did not know the estimated cost of the operation of the new Part until it had received in November, 1972, an advance copy of the cost projection prepared by the Advisory Council for the Housing Part. It was this itemized estimate of personnel and fund requirements which was forwarded to the Bureau of Budget by the Civil Court in November, 1972. The same operating estimate for a full year ($745,200) was attached to the “ First Report of the Advisory Council for the Housing Part ”, dated January 29, 1973, and distributed to Mayor Lindsay, among others.\\nConsidering that this legislation was adopted on June 8,1972, it would appear that the petitioners have acted with celerity. The defense that budget estimates were not properly submitted is therefore dismissed as without merit under the prevailing .conditions since to sustain such a proposition would thwart constitutional and legislative intent and purpose and would indicate a preference of form over substance (Henderson v. La Guardia, 182 Misc. 1071, 1072-1073, affd. 268 App. Div. 892, affd. 294 N. Y. 728, supra). In reality, no cogent reason has been advanced which would in any manner compel this court to conclude that it is either illegal, impossible or impractical to appropriate funds at this date .by á modification of the city’s budget for the fiscal year 1972-1973.\\nAccordingly, petitioners’ request for relief, consonant with a recognition of orderly budgetary procedures is granted to the following extent: Respondents, having been made aware of the annual needs for the operation of the new Housing Part of the Civil Court, can in a simple investigation by the appropriate fiscal authorities of the City of New York, determine, based upon the foregoing estimate, what additional allocation should be made available to the Civil Court for that period of the present fiscal year from April 1, 1973 and ending June 30, 1973.\\nThe budgetary allowance for the entire operation of the Civil Court, including the Housing Part, can and should be made under regular procedures for the on-coming fiscal year commencing July 1,1973 and terminating June 30,1974. Petitioners have advanced no reasons to this court why such a course of conduct cannot be followed because the 1973-1974 budget has not yet been adopted. Respondents, therefore, in accordance with the foregoing, are to fund the Civil Court so that it might be able to undertake the new and additional jurisdiction conferred upon it by chapter 982 of the Laws of 1972 by April 1, 1973.\\nThe right of the public to a swift adjudication of housing complaints is to prevail over obstinacy.\\nThe respondents and each of them are ordered and directed to proceed forthwith to take the necessary action to make available the funds which are required to properly staff and operate the Housing Part of the Civil Court of the City of New York now scheduled to open on April 1, 1973.',\n",

       "       'text': 'Miles F. McDonald, J.\\nThis is an action to recover for services rendered hy plaintiff as a “ Clerk to Justice ”, to which title she was appointed by Hon. Harold J. McLaughlin, Judge of the Civil Court of the City of New York (formerly President-Justice of the Municipal Court of the City of New York).\\nThe facts are not in dispute. On December 7, 1962, plaintiff was appointed by Judge McLaughlin to fill an existing vacancy in the position involved. The pay rate was $3,805 per annum and plaintiff has received no compensation for services rendered since the date of her appointment.\\nThe sole issue here is whether Judge McLaughlin, or for that matter any Judge of the Civil Court, may appoint a personal assistant under the authority of section 222 of the Judiciary Law.\\nThere is general agreement that the right to make such appointment had resided in the Justices of the Municipal Court of the City of New York by virtue of the provisions of subdivision 9 of section 7-a of the former New York City Municipal Court Code. The latter code was repealed in its entirety and the Municipal Court was abolished as of September 1, 1962. (L. 1962, ch. 693; CCA, §§ 196, 200, renumbered §§ 2207 and 2300 by L. 1963, ch. 564.) Simultaneously therewith, the Justices of the Municipal Court were designated Judges of the successor Civil Court of the City of New York. (CCA, § 190; renumbered § 2201 by L. 1963, ch. 564.)\\nFormer subdivision 9 of section 7-a was not carried over into the New York City Civil Court Act. Section 222 of the Judiciary Law, also effective September 1, 1962, was enacted as part of a series of legislative measures designed to give effect to the recent constitutional amendment creating a unified court system for the State. Section 222 reads as follows: “ Wherever, under the provisions of any law heretofore adopted, a judge or justice of the unified court system is authorised to appoint personal assistants to render to him legal or clerical services, the power of such judge or justice to make such appointments shall continue, notwithstanding the provisions of section two hundred fourteen of this chapter, in accordance with the standards and administrative policies adopted by the administrative board pursuant to the provisions of section two hundred twelve of this chapter and subject to the final determination of budgets by appropriating bodies as provided in section twenty-nine of article six of the constitution.” (Emphasis supplied.)\\nConcededly, no standards and administrative policies have been adopted by the Administrative Board with respect to personal assistants to Judges of the Civil Court. It also appears that the necessary provisions in the budget for the filling of such position were met by the Board of Estimate of the City of New York and that adequate funds have been allocated for the payment of plaintiff’s salary.\\nAs noted, the only question presented for our consideration is whether section 222 confers the appointive power here questioned. In this connection, we are called upon to determine whether the former Municipal Court Code, in general, and subdivision 9 of section 7-a thereof, in particular, shall be treated as ‘1 provisions of any law heretofore adopted ’ ’ within the intendment of section 222 of the Judiciary Law.\\nThe city asserts that the quoted term refers only to a “ heretofore adopted ” law which has been continuously in effect. Pointing out that the “heretofore adopted” law (N. Y. City Mun. Ct. Code) was repealed, the city urges that the power of appointment conferred therein has not been continuously in effect and hence was not preserved by section 222. In other words, says the city, since section 7-a fell with the repeal of the Municipal Court Code, it does not qualify as a provision of any law “ heretofore adopted.”\\nPursuing this theme further, the city maintains that the Civil Court is a new entity which came into existence with the creation of the unified court system and that a Judge of the Civil Court may not be deemed “ a judge or justice of the unified court system ’ ’ who had authority to appoint under the provisions of any law ‘ ‘ heretofore ’ ’ adopted. In the same vein, it argues that the words “ is authorized,” as employed in section 222, may not be taken to mean “was authorized ” or “has been authorized,” and that the use of the present tense includes the future and not the past.\\nI am not persuaded by the logic of any of these contentions for they appear to run counter to the plain intent of the statute. It is well settled that the language in a legislative-enactment will generally be construed according to its natural and most obvious sense, without resorting to artificial or forced construction (McKinney’s Cons. Laws of N. Y., Book 1, Statutes, § 94). A fair reading of section 222 indicates that the Legislature, by providing for the continuance of the power of appointment in a Judge or Justice “ under the provisions of any law heretofore adopted,” intended to incorporate by reference the language of subdivision 9 of section 7-a of the former Municipal Court Code and thereby preserve the status quo in this highly personal and confidential area of judicial prerogative.\\nThe city’s contention that a Judge of the Civil Court is not “ a judge or justice of the unified court system” within the contemplation of section 222 finds no support in the language of that provision or in the views expressed by the legislative committee sponsoring its enactment — which we may properly consider in the ascertainment of the legislative intent (McKinney’s Cons. Laws of N. Y., Book 1, Statutes, § 125; Matter of Hamlin, 226 N. Y. 407, 414). The Report of the Joint Legislative Committee on Court Reorganization, dated January 30, 1962 and entitled “Judicial Administration: Organization of the Unified Court System of the State of New York”, states in part (p. 6): “A judge who is authorized under existing law to appoint personal assistants to render to film legal or clerical services, will continue to have that power under the proposed appended legislation, subject only to the Administrative Board’s standards and policies and to the budgetary powers of appropriating bodies.” (Emphasis supplied.)\\nIt cannot be gainsaid that section 7-a of the New York City Municipal Court Code was an “ existing law” when the committee rendered its report to the Legislature. The reference in such report to a Judge “who is authorized under existing law to appoint personal assistants ” would be meaningless if we were to hold, as the city contends, that it did not include, among others, Justices of the then existing Municipal Court. The expression “ any law heretofore adopted”, as used in section 222, must be equated and read in conjunction with the term ‘‘ existing law” as used in the committee report since both were presented to the Legislature in the same report and at the same time.\\nThe argument that the phrase “ is authorized ” speaks only in futuro has no merit for it is preceded by the words “ under the provisions of any law heretofore adopted”, which, when read together, indicate that a past connotation was intended. In the context used, “ is authorized ” must be taken to mean “ was authorized ” or “ has been authorized.” (See People v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co.,, 117 N. Y. 150, 158; Stack v. City of Brooklyn, 150 N. Y. 335, 342; Louisville So, R. R, Co, v. Lewis, 101 Ky. 296; Stone v. Morgan,, 65 Miss. 247; 48 C. J. S. p. 774.)\\nLegal niceties and semantics aside, we must not be unmindful that the new judiciary article of the Constitution, adopted by the People on November 7, 1961, abolished the Municipal Court of the City of New York and other courts within the City of New York. Implementing legislation was mandated by this constitutional amendment to insure that the Justices and nonjudicial personnel of the courts affected would continue uninterruptedly as Justices and employees in the unified court system.\\nWith this underlying background, and for all the reasons previously stated, I believe the conclusion is fully warranted that the Legislature intended to invest Judges of the Civil Court with the same power formerly enjoyed by Justices of the Municipal Court to appoint their confidential clerks. Any other conclusion would, in my opinion, do violence to the legislative intent lucidly expressed in section 222 of the Judiciary Law. Of course, such power of appointment is to be exercised in accordance with any standards and policies which may be adopted by the Administrative Board pursuant to the provisions of section 212 of the Judiciary Law. But until their adoption, the power of appointment is unrestricted. The judgment should be affirmed, without costs.',\n",

This action, ostensibly brought to recover for services rendered by plaintiff as a “ Clerk to Justice ”, pursuant to an alleged appointment by the Honorable Harold J. McLaughlin, a Judge of the Civil Court of the City of New York, is admittedly a deliberate thrust for power by said Justice, and an open and frank attack upon the recently enacted court reorganization constitutional amendment of the New York State Constitution and the implementary legislation thereto. The City of New York, defendant herein, claims and the facts indicate, that such amendment and the legislation pertaining thereto deny to the Judges of the newly created Civil Court of the City of New York the power theretofore resident in the Justices of the former Municipal and City Courts of the City of New York to appoint their own confidential clerks to Justices at will. The legislative history of that former right to designate a confidential clerk is fully detailed in the majority opinion of my learned colleagues.\\nThe decision of the Judge of the Civil Court, which is before us for review, breathes a spirit of protest against structures presently existing upon the prior illimitable appointive power.\\nThe reorganization of the courts of our State under unified centralized management and control was not expected to and did not find universal favor among many of the Judges affected. Certainly it is understandable that the loss of power to appoint their own confidential clerks is hardly palatable to 95 Judges of the Civil Court, who must presently, under existing law, in my opinion, look to the Appellate Divisions of the First and Second Departments for such confidential assistants.\\nNevertheless, by overwhelming vote of the People of the State of New York, who adopted the new judiciary article of the State Constitution, precisely such a result was achieved and power of appointment of all employees of the Civil Court, including the one at bar, was withheld from the individual judges and given to the Appellate Divisions of the First and Second Departments.\\nThe entire scheme of the court reorganization structure provides for such centralized control over all of the Civil Courts, and all judicial and nonjudicial personnel as well, by the Administrative Board and the Appellate Divisions of the First and Second Departments.\\nHowever much Judges affected by this constitutional amendment and the legislation implementary thereof may chafe at the restraints imposed, they may not engage in judicial nullification of the mandate of the People, as would appear to be the purpose of the determination below.\\nThe right to appoint a confidential clerk does not exist in law as an implicit privilege of a court or Judge. Wherever such authority to designate an exempt clerk exists, it springs from a clear and express mandate of the Legislature. Such authority was provided for in the former New York City Municipal Court Code (§ 7-a, subd. 9) and in the former New York City Court Act (§8). In many other courts, including the new Civil Court, Criminal Court and Family Court in the City of New York, no such statutory right exists.\\nThe only claim of authority or right to make the appointment herein considered is pursuant to the provisions of subdivision 9 of section 7-a of the former Municipal Court Code. By subdivision a of section 35 of article VI of the New York State Constitution, the New York City Court and the New York City Municipal Court were expressly abolished. To the same end the new Civil Court Act (L. 1962, ch. 693, eff. Sept. 1, 1963) expressly repealed the former Municipal Court Code. (It also expressly repealed the provisions of the City Court Act.) The abolition of these two courts under constitutional authority and the express repeal of the Municipal Court Code and the City Court Act, under which they functioned, brought to an end the express power theretofore conferred upon the Justices of those two former courts to appoint confidential clerks.\\nIn place of these two courts a new court was created known as the New York City Civil Court — wholly different in jurisdiction, in structure and in personnel from either of the preexisting abolished courts. Under section 3 of the New York City Civil Court Act (now renumbered 103), as well as under section 214 of the Judiciary Law, full and complete authority with respect to the appointment of all nonjudicial personnel of all courts was vested in the various Appellate Divisions.\\nBy this broad sweep of authority all power of appointment was withheld from the individual Judges of the Civil Court, but instead vested in the Appellate Divisions of the First and Second Departments.\\nThe scheme of judicial reorganization provided for the continuance of certain courts only — for instance, the Surrogate’s Court, Supreme Court and the County Courts outside of the City of New York, and abolished others including the Municipal and City Courts of the City of New York, the Domestic Relations Court of the City of New York, Special .Sessions Court and Magistrates’ Court, as well as the County Courts within the City of New York.\\nIn certain of the continued courts express provision existed giving Justices of those courts authority to appoint confidential clerks. In other courts no such right had ever been conferred. By section 222 of the Judiciary Law (L. 1962, ch. 684) the State Legislature evidenced its intention to preserve to those Judges in the continued courts only, who by law had the express power of such appointment, the right to continue to exercise such power, notwithstanding the broad sweep of section 214 of the Judiciary Law. Section 222 of the Judiciary Law refers only to those courts continued under court reorganization enactments. Nowhere does this enabling legislation give the right to any former Justice of the abolished court to act under repealed laws nor does it provide authority in any Judge of the newly created Civil Court to designate a confidential clerk. The abolished Municipal Court is not a court which became part of the unified court system and no residual power remains to Justices thereof.\\nTo contend otherwise is to suggest that the express repeal of the power to appoint an exempt clerk, which occurred when the Municipal Court and the City Court were abolished and the laws under which they operated repealed, were themselves repealed by implication by section 222 of the Judiciary Law and rights conferred upon the Judges of the newly created Civil Court of the City of New York by such implication.\\nSection 222 of the Judiciary Law speaks in the present tense Avith respect to Judges who by existing law are presently authorized to appoint personal assistants. It is here contended that what was once still is, and that the term “ is authorized ” shall be interpreted to mean1 ‘ once Avas authorized ’ ’. Such a strained construction, amounting to repeal of the repealer statutes heretofore set forth cannot be justifiedby implication. Had the Legislature desired to give Judges in the new Civil Court the power to appoint a confidential clerk — a right, incidentally, not accorded to the Judges of the Criminal Court of the City of New York or the Family Court in the City of New York (courts of equal salary and interchangeable Judges) — it would have been very simple for if to have done so either by express enactment or by appropriate language in section 222 of the Judiciary Law,\\nThe fallacy of plaintiff’s position becomes quite clear when viewed with respect to the authority of a newly elected Judge of the Civil Court to make such an appointment. Where in any existing law do we find legislative authority for a Judge elected to that court in the year 1964, for instance, to appoint a confidential clerk 1 It can hardly be contended that such newly elected Judge might make such an appointment pursuant to the repealed laws relating to the former City Court or Municipal Court. Such newly elected or appointed Judge of the Civil Court would look in vain for such express power to designate a “ Confidential Clerk”.\\nThe rationale for the majority opinion herein is claimed to be found in a few words contained in a report by the Legislative Committee which drafted the enabling legislation here in question. To make reference to such report is inappropriate in view of the position adopted by my learned associates as well as by myself, that the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous. Reference to extraneous legislative history is appropriate only where ambiguity exists.\\nNevertheless, it is quite clear from the entire context of that report, as well as the subsequent legislative enactments, that the broad sweep of the legislative report in question, which related to all of the courts of this State, and the many thousands of judicial personnel involved, did not contemplate continuance of power to appoint a confidential clerk by Judges of the Municipal Court and the City Court of the City of New York, which were to be abolished, but was intended to and did refer to such courts only as would survive and function under the new court reorganization and with respect to which a power of appointment of a confidential assistant was provided for by express unrepealed legislation, and that nothing less and nothing more was intended.\\nIt follows therefore that the right of a Civil Court Judge to a confidential clerk is at the will, consent and appointment of the appropriate Appellate Divisions of the First and Second Departments. Precisely for this reason has the Administrative Board failed to set standards and qualifications for the designation of such appointments, such as have been enunciated with respect to those courts in which the right of appointment by the individual Judges has survived. It may be pertinent to observe that recognizing such absence of power to designate a confidential clerk, proposed legislation was introduced at the last session of the Legislature to confer each authority upon Civil Court Judges, which failed of enactment.\\nFrom all of the foregoing it is quite clear that the power of appointment resides solely in the Appellate Division, as does the right to determine whether such category of appointment shall in fact exist at all. This claim of illimitable authority by the former Presiding Justice of the Municipal Court to make any appointment he chooses, by authority of the repealed Municipal Court Act and without consulting the Appellate Division, is without foundation in law and violative of the State Constitution and of the various sections of the enabling legislation thereto pertaining, particularly section 214 of the Judiciary Law.\\nAccordingly, I would -reverse the determination below, dismiss the complaint herein and render judgment for the defendant, City of New York.\\nBrown, J., concurs with McDonald, J.; Benjamin, J., dissents in opinion.\\nJudgment affirmed, etc.',\n",

       "       'text': \"CARROLL, Judge.\\nOn the suggestion filed by the petitioner Ike Attias seeking a writ of prohibition against the judges of the civil court of record of Dade County, we issued a rule nisi, to which the respondents filed a reply. After hearing thereon we concluded that the rule should be discharged.\\nIn the suggestion it was alleged that an action for removal of the petitioner as a tenant was filed by one W. L. Walker in the civil court of record; that petitioner filed a counterclaim for damages in an amount in excess of the jurisdiction of that court, and thereupon moved for transfer of the cause to the circuit court; that an order was entered transferring only the counterclaim to the circuit court and retaining jurisdiction of the action for removal of tenant in the civil court of record.\\nProhibition was sought in this court on the theory and contention that the civil court of record was without jurisdiction to retain and determine the action for removal of tenant, in view of the provisions of rule 1.170(j) Fla.R.C.P., 30 F.S.A., for transfer of the plaintiff’s cause of action as well as the counterclaim to the court of higher jurisdiction, and that the latter court then “shall have full power and jurisdiction over the demands of all parties.”\\nThe respondents contend, and we agree, that the action for removal of tenant was properly retained in the civil court of record, as it was a statutory proceeding of which that court had jurisdiction, but of which the circuit court was without jurisdiction.\\nIncluded in the grant of original jurisdiction to circuit courts (Art. V, § 6(3) Fla.Const., 26 F.S.A.) is the following: “They shall have original jurisdiction of actions of forceable entry and unlawful detainer, and of such other matters as the legislature may provide.” The action in the civil court of record was not one for forcible entry or unlawful detainer, the procedure for which is outlined in Chapter 82, Fla.Stat., F.S.A., but was an action for removal of tenant as provided for under Chapter 83, relating to landlord and tenant under the summary process provided for therein. We have not been shown where jurisdiction has been conferred by the legislature on the circuit courts for the handling of the latter type actions. However, the jurisdiction thereof is expressly conferred on the civil court of record for Dade County. See Leaders International Jewelry v. Board of County Commissioners, Fla.App.1966, 183 So.2d 242.\\nChapter 65-2422 Laws of Florida 1965, Extra.Sess., providing for establishment of civil courts of record in counties having a population of not less than 400,000 (applicable in Dade County), and prescribing jurisdiction of such courts, provides in subsection (2) of section 2, in pertinent part, as follows:\\n“The civil courts of record shall also have jurisdiction over proceedings related to forcible entry and unlawful detention of lands and tenements and all proceedings for removal of tenant as prescribed by statutes for removal of tenant by county judge and over all other statutory remedies relating to landlord and tenant except when exclusive original jurisdiction of any such action is reserved to another court under the state constitution.”\\nIt will be noted that the jurisdiction thus conferred on the civil court of record of Dade County for proceeding's for removal of tenant is that which is prescribed by statute for removal of tenant by county judge. The latter is outlined and provided for in Chapter 83, Fla.Stat., F.S.A., §§ 83.20-83.27.\\nAn additional argument advanced by the respondents to justify the action of the trial court is that the rule relating to the filing of counterclaims does not contemplate the filing of a counterclaim to a petition filed under the summary statutory proceeding for removal of tenant. We pretermit ruling on that contention, in view of our disposition of the case on another ground as set out below.\\nAlthough the rule for transfer, taken literally, appears to command that the entire cause be transferred to the court of higher jurisdiction upon the filing by the defendant in the civil court of record of a counterclaim for damages in excess of the jurisdiction of that court, the rule should not be given literal application in an anomalous situation where to do so would lead to impracticality. See City of Miami v. Jafra Steel Corporation, Fla.1966, 184 So.2d 178.\\nThis case presents such a situation, because a literal compliance with the rule would result in transferring from the civil court of record to the circuit court, in addition to the counterclaim, a statutory proceeding for removal of tenant which the lower court has jurisdiction to entertain and determine, but which is a type of action for which the circuit court is not granted jurisdiction.\\nThe transfer rule must be read together with the organic law and statutes relating to jurisdiction of the actions involved. City of Miami v. Jafra Steel Corporation, supra. On doing so, we hold that the order entered in the civil court of record was eminently correct, and that the petitioner has not shown that in retaining the action for removal of tenant the respondents exceeded their jurisdiction or are acting without jurisdiction.\\nFor the reasons stated, the rule nisi is discharged and judgment is entered for respondents.\\nIt is so ordered.\\n1\\n. Subsection (j) of § 1.170 Fla.R.C.P. provides: “If the demand of any counterclaim or «cross-claim exceeds the jurisdiction of the court where the action is pending, the action shall be transferred forthwith to the court of the same county haying jurisdiction of the demand in the counterclaim or cross-claim with only such alterations in the pleadings as are essential. The court shall order the transfer of the action and the transmittal of all papers therein to tho proper court and thereupon the original papers shall be transmitted and filed, . together with a certified copy of the order. The court to which the action is transferred shall have full power and jurisdiction over the demands of all parties.”\",\n",

Where, however, by reason of manifest prejudicial error in the trial of the action in the civil court any party thereto has not had a fair trial and where substantial justice cannot otherwise be done and the rights of the parties otherwise observed and protected, the judgment of the civil court shall be reversed, and the •\\'circuit court shall remit the case to the civil court for a new trial or further proceedings.”\\nIt was under this section that the circuit court entered the order reversing and remanding the judgment appealed from. That there is manifest error in the trial in the civil court and an entire failure to comply with the statute in regard to making findings can hardly be questionéd. There is a clear dispute in the evidence, and the contention of the appellant that only one inference can be drawn from the facts cannot be sustained. Under these facts it was the duty of the circuit court under the provisions of sub. 3 to remand the case for further hearing. This is not in a technical sense a new trial. The case was remanded to complete the trial.\\' The matter having been remanded to the civil court to enable it to complete the trial, the order is not a final order and for that reason \"not appealable.\\nBy the Court. — The appeal is dismissed.',\n",

       "       'text': 'The following opinion was filed December 6, 1927:\\nDoerfler, J.\\nThis action was originally brought in the civil court of Milwaukee county against the defendant to recover damages to an automobile owned by the plaintiff, upon the ground that the automobile, which was stored in a certain garage, had been fraudulently converted by an employee of the garage keeper to his own use and to the use of the keeper. It is also charged in the complaint that the defendant insurance company insured the risk. Upon the trial in the civil court judgment was rendered in plaintiff’s favor on the 8th day of February, 1926.\\nOn February 10, 1926, the defendant filed notice of appeal to the circuit court for Milwaukee county and an affidavit of good faith. The appeal and folio costs were not paid until May 17, 1926. When the appeal came on for a hearing in the circuit court the plaintiff entered a special appearance and objected to the jurisdiction of the court for the reason that the costs and folio charges had not been paid within the time provided for by law.\\nSec. 2 of ch. 320 of the Laws of 1913 (p. 347), providing for appeals from the civil court to the circuit court for Milwaukee county, among other things provides as follows:\\n“Provided, that if the fees on appeal, including an amount sufficient to pay for fifty per cent, of the folios contained in the return, as estimated by the clerk upon request of the appellant, be not paid within twenty days from the date of the entry of judgment, the appeal shall be deemed dismissed.”\\nIt is conceded that such costs and folio fees were not paid within the twenty days provided for by law, the defendant claiming that such provision is merely directory, the plaintiff claiming that it is mandatory.\\nThe circuit court on December 13, 1910, which was about three years prior to the enactment of sec. 2, ch. 320, Laws of 1913, adopted certain rules for the speedy hearing of cases appealed from the civil court, and among such rules the following will be found:\\n“Conforming to the intention of the law that appeals from the civil court to the circuit court should be speedily heard and determined, the following rules are adopted:\\n“A. Motions and applications for hearing appeals from the civil court shall be made returnable before the calendar judge, whose duty it shall be to forthwith assign said cases for hearing.\\n“B. Such cases shall have preference over other cases pending before the branch of the court to which the case is assigned.\\n“C. If such cases are taken under advisement by the trial judge, decision shall be announced within two weeks from the time of submission.” .\\nIn recent years it has been the established policy of this state to dispatch the trial of cases and to bring them on for hearing and dispose of them at the earliest possible time. Such policy existed at the time of the creation of the civil court, and such policy is manifested not only by the Civil Court Act itself, but by the rules adopted by the circuit court for Milwaukee county. Prior to the enactment of ch. 320 aforesaid, an appellant could frustrate the policy of the state as thus, expressed by withholding the payment of the costs and folio charges. It is apparent on the face of said section that the legislature intended to obviate such delays and to create a situation where appeals could be promptly heard and promptly dispatched. The legislature therefore fixed a definite period during which these costs and fees should be paid. If it be held that this section is merely directory and not mandatory, then nothing was accomplished by its enactment, but things would be left substantially in the same form as they were in prior to the enactment of the section. The only way that this section can be made effective and made to serve the purpose intended by the legislature is to hold that it is mandatory.\\nIn Filer & Stowell Co. v. C., M. & St. P. R. Co. 161 Wis. 591, 155 N. W. 118, it was held: “The right of appeal is wholly statutory and so may be granted upon such terms and with such limitations as the written law may prescribe, and . . . if no such right is given, none exists.”\\nThe word “deemed” is defined in 18 Corp. Jur. 451, as meaning “adjudged, judged, considered, decreed, determined, declared.” The provisions of sec. 2 are self-executing, requiring no formal order for the dismissal of the appeal. In other words, the attempted appeal becomes ineffectual, and places the appellant in the same situation that he would be in if no appeal had been attempted at all. The record is therefore not properly before the circuit court, and must be returned to the civil court for further proceedings according to law.\\nBy the Court. — The judgment of the lower court is reversed, with directions to return the record to the civil court for further proceedings according to law.\\nA motion for a rehearing was denied, with $25 costs, on February 7, 1928.',\n",

       "       'text': 'Almand, Chief Justice.\\nNorthern Freight Lines, Inc. brought its complaint against Fireman’s Fund Insurance Co., the Marshal of the Civil Court of Fulton County and his deputy.\\nIt was alleged that at the November 1968 term of the Civil Court of DeKalb County the defendant obtained a money judgment against one James W. Bowers and that in February, 1969, a summons of garnishment was directed to the plaintiff by the Civil Court of Fulton County. The entry of service shows that the defendant deputy marshal served the summons on, \"Mr. Morris, its Agt., and personally in charge of the office and place of business at the time of service of said garnishee in said county.” It was further alleged that at the time of said service, one Thomas E. Folds and not Mr. Morris, was in charge of its office and place of business.\\nNo answer was filed to said summons and a money judgment was entered on May 7, 1969, against the plaintiff. It was alleged that this judgment was void because no jurisdiction had been acquired over it.\\nThe prayers were to vacate and set aside the judgment against the plaintiff and to enjoin the defendant Fireman’s Fund from enforcing the judgment.\\nThe record shows that on September 25, 1969, the plaintiff filed in the Civil Court case, a motion to set aside the judgment against it on the ground that \"Mr. Morris” was not personally, as its agent, in charge of its office and place of business at the time purported service of garnishment summons was made. This motion was dismissed on motion of Fireman’s Fund, on the ground that neither the marshal nor his deputy was made a party to the motion. On appeal this dismissal was affirmed. Northern Freight Lines, Inc. v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos., 121 Ga. App. 786 (175 SE2d 104).\\nThe defendant Fireman’s Fund, in its defense asserted: (a) that plaintiff was estopped by Civil Court order, (b) defects if any that might have existed in the service of summons of garnishment were waived by the plaintiff, and (c) it had an adequate remedy at law.\\nBoth parties made motions for a summary judgment. After a hearing on the motions, the court granted the motion of the plaintiff and set aside and vacated the judgment rendered in the Civil Court of Fulton County. The appeal is from this order.\\nThe Court of Appeals in reviewing the order of the Civil Court dismissing the motion to set aside the garnishment judgment said: \"There is authority for the proposition that a court in a proper independent proceeding with the necessary process, might exercise the jurisdiction, which obtained at common law, to set aside judgments for irregularies [sic] not appearing on the face of the record.” Northern Freight Lines, Inc. v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos., 121 Ga. App. 786, 787, supra. In the former case the absence of the marshal and his deputy as parties was not a nonamendable defect appearing on the face of the record. The failure to have made such parties in the Civil Court is not such a waiver under Code Ann. § 81A-112 as would prevent the plaintiff from bringing the present equitable action to set aside the judgment on the ground of accident and mistake. See Watkins v. Donalson, 217 Ga. 524 (123 SE2d 728).\\nOn the hearing of the motions for summary judgments the general manager of Northern Freight Lines, Inc., testified by affidavit, that on the day the deputy marshal made his return by stating service of the summons of garnishment was made upon the corporation by service upon a \"Mr. Morris, its Agent,” was untrue in that the agent and person in charge of its office was Thomas E. Folds, and that the garnishee had no notice of the pendency of the garnishment proceedings until after default judgment had been rendered against it.\\nIn his verified answer, the deputy marshal said: \"Answering paragraph 7 these defendants say that Mr. Morris who was served appeared to be in charge of the plaintiff’s office and place of business at the time and was a person upon whom defendant Higginbotham had previously served one or more summons of garnishment directed to Northern Freight Lines. Defendants show that in Case No. 267961, Civil Court of Fulton County, a summons of garnishment directed to Northern Freight Lines was served on the said Mr. Morris on January 16, 1969, and said summons was answered by Northern Freight Lines by an answer whose truth was sworn to by Raymond Morris, City Dispatcher, on February 17, 1969. These defendants allege and believe that the said Morris was in charge of the office of plaintiff when service in the within case was made, and that by action of Northern Freight Lines he was recognized and treated as being a proper person upon whom summons of garnishment directed to Northern Freight Lines could be served.”\\nThis answer was not a sufficient rebuttal of the positive and direct evidence of the plaintiff that Folds and not Morris was its agent on the day service was made. On this issue there was no genuine issue of fact. There being no other issue of fact between the parties it was not error to sustain the plaintiff’s motion for a summary judgment and to vacate the judgment of the Civil Court. Compare Citizens Bank of Hapeville v. Alexander-Smith Academy, 226 Ga. 871 (178 SE2d 178).\\nJudgment affirmed.\\nAll the Justices concur.',\n",

       "       'text': 'Hawes, Justice.\\nThe Court of Appeals certified to this court the following question, a determination of which is necessary for dicision of the case before it: \"Section 13 of the Act approved March 3, 1955 (Ga. L. 1955, pp. 2552, 2558) establishing the Civil Court of Bibb County provides: \\'Be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that said Civil Court of Bibb County shall be a court of record, and shall have a seal, and the minutes, records and other books and files that are required by law to be kept for the superior court shall in the same manner, so far as the jurisdiction of said Civil Court of Bibb County may render necessary, be kept in and for said Civil Court of Bibb County; provided that the Clerk of said Civil Court of Bibb County shall not be required to keep a book of final records, but shall see that the records are preserved in suitable files with all original papers in each case, which shall not be removed from said clerk’s office except upon order of the Judge of said Civil Court of Bibb County upon good cause shown and then only upon receipt of counsel and such removal from the clerk’s office shall not continue for a longer period than five days.’ [Emphasis supplied.]\\n\"Does Section 13 of the aforesaid Act make the Civil Court of Bibb County a court of record within the meaning of Section 1 of the Georgia Civil Practice Act (Ga. L. 1966, pp. 609, 610)? See, in this connection, DeKalb County v. Deason, 221 Ga. 237 (144 SE2d 446).”\\nA careful reading of the case of DeKalb County v. Deason, 221 Ga. 237 (144 SE2d 446) reveals \"that the one essential feature necessary to constitute a court of record is that a permanent record of the proceedings of the court must be made and kept. A definition of such record generally accepted is that it is a precise history of a suit from its commencement to its termination, including conclusions of law thereon drawn by the proper officer for the purpose of perpetuating the exact state of facts.” In that case this court held that the Civil and Criminal Court of DeKalb County was not a court of record because it was not required by the Acts creating it to enroll its acts and proceedings in a permanent memorial, nor did it do so. In that case, Justice Mobley, speaking for this court, did not undertake to define precisely what sort of record would constitute such a \"permanent memorial” as would satisfy that requirement. Impliedly, at least, it was said that the requirement embodied in Code Ann. §24-2715 (2) requiring the clerks of the superior courts to record immediately in a book of final record every part of the pleadings in every case, etc., would satisfy this requirement. At that time (that is, in 1965) a reading of Code Ann. §24-2715 would seem to have indicated that it was the intention of the legislature that such a permanent record was to be kept \"in well bound books,” and this is undoubtedly the kind of record the court had in mind, based on the provisions of the Code respecting superior courts and based on the common law definition of courts of record referred to in that case.\\nHowever, as was pointed out in the opinion in that case, there was no constitutional provision defining courts of record, nor was there any statute generally defining such courts. There is no such constitutional or statutory provision today. However, by the Act approved April 8, 1968 (Ga. L. 1968, pp. 1117, 1118) the legislature amended Par. 1 of Code §24-2715 by adding thereto a provision permitting the clerks of superior courts in lieu of recording in well bound books to record proceedings of such courts on microfilm subject only to the condition that they provide a machine for reading and reproducing such microfilmed records. It is inconceivable to this court that it was the intention of the legislature, in so providing, to destroy the character of the superior courts of this State as courts of record. The important thing in making such a record of the acts and doings of a court of record is the permanency of such record, and not the substance upon which such record is kept. In laying down such court-made rules as this one defining \"courts of record” we must not be blind to technological progress. Indeed, the history of the courts of this State shows that they have not disregarded such progress, for today the almost universal medium upon which court proceedings are recorded is paper and not parchment, though a rigid adherence to the Blackstonian definition of \"courts of record” would require the continued use for such purposes of \"sheepskins dressed for writing.” Black’s Law Diet., 4th Ed., p. 1268. We, therefore, hold that the General Assembly, in its infinite wisdom, has the authority to provide that such records as are required to be kept by courts of record may be kept in any reasonable form so long as the form adopted appears to be reasonably calculated to be one which lends itself to permanency. We are not prepared to say that the microfilming of such records and the retention of the microfilm in permanent files by the clerk does not meet such requirement.\\nHaving thus recognized the power and authority of the General Assembly to declare what kinds of records need to be kept by the clerks of the superior courts to constitute them courts of record we move to a consideration of the 1955 Act creating the Civil Court of Bibb County. Section 13 of that Act as quoted in the question propounded by the Court of Appeals declares that the Civil Court of Bibb County shall be a court of record. Upon what authority can this court say that the General Assembly does not have power to declare the Civil Court of Bibb County to be a court of record? We find no constitutional inhibition against such a declaration, and we hold the legislature may declare what courts it deems to be courts of record (see State v. Allen, 117 Ohio St. 470 (159 NE 591)), and provide what records such court shall keep so long as such records appear reasonably calculated to preserve as a perpetual memorial the acts and judicial proceedings of such courts including a precise history of suits brought therein from their commencement to their termination including conclusions of law thereon drawn by the proper officer. DeKalb County v. Deason, 221 Ga. 238, supra. At the time of the decision by this court in DeKalb County v. Deason, supra, there was no declaration by the legislature that the court there involved, the Civil and Criminal Court of DeKalb County, was a court of record, and, therefore, that decision was correct as the law stood at the time it was rendered.\\nWith respect to the Civil Court of Bibb County, the legislature had enacted ten years earlier the Act, the provisions of Sec. 13 of which are the subject matter of the question certified by the Court of Appeals in this case. By that Act, the legislature not only declared that the Civil Court of Bibb County shall be a court of record, that it would have a seal, that it would keep minutes and such records and other books and files as those required by law to be kept by the superior court, insofar as the jurisdiction of that court might render it necessary. One exception to the record keeping requirements of the superior court permitted the Clerk of the Civil Court of Bibb County was that in lieu of a book of final records the clerk was permitted to preserve in suitable file all the original papers in each case together with the records of the proceedings. The question propounded by the Court of Appeals did not allude to the Act approved March 10, 1964 (Ga. L. 1964, p. 2688, et seq.) amending the 1955 Act and adding thereto a Sec. 13 (a) permitting the clerk to record on microfilm all original papers in each case filed with the clerk and to thereafter destroy all such original papers. That Act also added a new Sec. 13 (b) requiring the clerk to provide adequate equipment for viewing such records as shall be maintained on microfilm. We think that, under the principles announced above, the Act creating the Civil Court of Bibb County establishes it as a court of record, and we hold that said court is a court of record within the meaning of that term as used in the Civil Practice Act.\\nSubmitted January 11, 1971\\nDecided May 6, 1971.\\nHarry F.

       "       'text': 'OPINION OF THE COURT\\nPeter J. Kelly, J.\\nSince it appears that the prior decision of this court contained several typographical and grammatical mistakes, the court, on its own motion, recalls its decision of December 17, 1999 and substitutes the following in its place and stead.\\nDefendant, in this action to recover for unpaid no-fault benefits, moves to dismiss the complaint based upon forum non conveniens pursuant to CPLR 327 (a).\\nThe defendant herein is a self-insured corporation engaged in the business of renting cars under the name of Enterprise Rent-A-Car. Plaintiff’s assignor, a resident of Kings County, was involved in a car accident on the New Jersey Turnpike while driving a car he rented from defendant. Plaintiff had submitted a “no-fault” claim with defendant for payment of medical services allegedly rendered to its assignor. The claim has not been paid, and plaintiff has instituted this action to recover payment for its services as well as statutory interest and attorney’s fees.\\nThe defendant argues that this matter should be dismissed pursuant to the above statute in the interest of substantial justice since the plaintiff’s assignor does not reside in Queens County, defendant’s principal place of business is in Suffolk County, the accident occurred in New Jersey, and therefore the case lacks substantial contact with this County and court. Plaintiff, on the other hand, opposes the motion arguing that the statute relied upon by the defendant does not apply in New York City Civil Court and that, in any event, venue is correct.\\nThe relief requested by the defendant is not unique; in fact, motions to change venue of actions for reimbursement of no-fault claims are frequently interposed. However, the basis for the relief sought is unique. Most motions brought for a change of venue have been brought pursuant to CCA article 3 or CPLR article 5. Instead of instituting its motion pursuant to either of these two articles, defendant contends that CPLR 327 provides a mechanism for this court to dismiss this matter since, from the facts presented, it appears this action should have been commenced in either Kings County or Suffolk County.\\nCPLR 327 (a) provides as follows: “When the court finds that in the interest of substantial justice the action should be heard in another forum, the court, on the motion of any party, may stay or dismiss the action in whole or in part on any conditions that may be just. The domicile or residence in this state of any party to the action shall not preclude the court from staying or dismissing the action.”\\nPlaintiffs initial argument in opposition, that this statute does not apply in Civil Court, is not persuasive. CPLR 101 mandates that the CPLR shall apply to all civil proceedings “in all courts of the state * * * except where the procedure is regulated by inconsistent statute.” A search of the CCA reveals not only the nonexistence of an inconsistent statute but also a necessity for the statute’s applicability.\\nAs a court of limited jurisdiction, the Civil Court may only transfer venue of an action, if found to be improper, to another county inside the territorial limits of New York City. To accept plaintiffs position would mean that this court would have little recourse where it is found that venue of a matter properly belongs outside New York City.\\nWhile mindful of the decision in Suffolk Chiropractic Ctr. v GEICO Ins. Co. (171 Misc 2d 855), cited in plaintiffs papers, this court declines to follow its reasoning since the focus of that court’s decision on the wording of the statute regarding residency “in this state” as opposed to a “county of this state” is unconvincing. A resident of any county of this State is, by necessity, a resident of this State and the wording is not unusual since the CPLR is designed to have State-wide applicability.\\nThe statute plainly states that if a court finds an action should be heard “in another forum” (CPLR 327 [a], [emphasis supplied.]) the court may take what actions it deems appropriate. While in an action brought in Supreme Court this would necessarily mean a different State, there is no reason why, by extension, it should not entail consideration of a more appropriate venue by a court of limited jurisdiction to a different forum in this State when required to ensure substantial justice is achieved.\\nAdditionally, while not directly on point as the case involved both a transfer to another State and a ruling on the level of proof needed to sustain an allegation of residency, the Court of Appeals did not challenge the use of the doctrine of forum non conveniens by the Civil Court in dismissing an action pursuant to CPLR 327 (see, Rafter v Newark Ins. Co., 30 NY2d 819).\\nHowever, the fact that the statute is applicable in this court does not end the court’s inquiry. The next issue to be resolved is whether the Civil Court of the City of New York is a proper venue for this action.\\nIn this case, defendant argues that venue does not properly lie in Queens County since Suffolk County is the County of defendant’s principal place of business. This is an argument raised on a consistent basis before this court despite the clear language of the CCA regarding the venue of actions brought against corporations in the Civil Court. CCA 305 (b) provides that a corporation is deemed a resident of any county wherein it transacts business, keeps an office, has an agency, or is established by law. Consequently the plaintiff, in opposition, urges that the motion be denied since defendant transacts business in Queens County and therefore can be considered a resident thereof.\\nUnfortunately, plaintiff has not submitted sufficient proof that this defendant transacts business in Queens County. Plaintiff relies on an affidavit from a claims representative employed by Elco Administrative Services, which sets forth an address in Queens. It is not clear, however, if the address listed is for Elco or ELRAC. While the court is obviously aware that an entity known as Enterprise Rent-A-Car transacts business in this County, plaintiffs papers do not establish a legal or factual relationship between this defendant and any of the Enterprise offices in this County.\\nFinally, the court also notes that while Enterprise Rent-A-Car transacts business in this County, it also transacts business in Kings County. Since an entity may legally have more than one residence, it appears that venue based upon the defendant’s residence may also be properly found in Kings County.\\nFor the reasons stated above, the court finds that while venue of this action does not properly lie in Queens County, venue based upon the plaintiffs, and perhaps the defendant’s, residence does properly lie in the Civil Court.\\nIf defendant were seeking to dismiss this matter solely on the basis that venue more properly belonged in Kings County, or any other county within New York City, the motion would have to be denied since defendant could only obtain that relief pursuant to the venue provisions of the CCA. CPLR 327 is only applicable to situations where it appears venue more properly lies outside the New York City Civil Court. The issue remaining therefore is whether this matter should be dismissed in the interest of substantial justice on the ground that it should be heard in Suffolk County.\\nDefendant’s papers, though, do not provide a sufficient factual basis to satisfy the requirement for a transfer of this matter from New York City Civil Court to District Court in Suffolk County. Defendant has not sustained its burden in establishing how it would be disproportionately inconvenienced by litigating this matter in Civil Court, or how the District Court can better serve the convenience of the parties, nor has the defendant shown that there is, or would be, an undue hardship placed on the Civil Court if this matter were to be tried here (Islamic Republic v Pahlavi, 62 NY2d 474; Banco Ambrosiano v Artoc Bank & Trust, 62 NY2d 65; Varkonyi v S. A. Empresa De Viacao Airea Rio Grandense [Varig], 22 NY2d 333).\\nAccordingly, defendant’s motion to dismiss this action pursuant to CPLR 327 on the ground of forum non conveniens is denied.\\nHowever, since plaintiff has not established that defendant is a resident of Queens County and it appears venue properly lies in Kings County, the court, on its own motion pursuant to CCA 306, transfers this action from Civil Court, Queens County, to Civil Court, Kngs County.',\n",

       "       'text': 'OPINION OF THE COURT\\nWilliam Ritholtz, J.\\nPlaintiff, Evan K. Gordon, brought this action against the Board of Education of the City of New York to recover damages for personal injuries he sustained when his hands and arms were severely cut. The plaintiff, a student at Brooklyn Technical High School, was injured when he placed his hands on a panel of wired safety glass mounted in a swinging fire door at the school, and the glass broke causing the safety wires to become imbedded in his forearms.\\nThe plaintiff commenced the action in the Supreme Court, Kings County, on November 4, 1980. Under the ad damnum clause of the complaint, the plaintiff demanded judgment in the amount of $300,000.\\nAs set forth in his bill of particulars, the plaintiff’s injuries included avulsions of the left forearm, arm and right wrist; scarring with keloidal formation; injury to the nerves; and mental anguish. Plaintiff’s physical injuries are permanent. His special damages were for hospital bills, doctors’ bills and medical supplies.\\nBy order dated May 21, 1985, the action was transferred to the Civil Court of the City of New York, Kings County, pursuant to CPLR 325 (d). The matter came to trial on October 6, 1986, in Part 29, Civil Court, Kings County. On October 17, 1986, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for $1,000,000.\\nSubsequent to the jury verdict, the plaintiff moved for an order pursuant to CPLR 3025 (b) and (c), granting plaintiff leave to conform the pleadings to the proof, to the extent of amending the ad damnum clause to the sum of $1,000,000. The motion did not include a request to retransfer the action from the Civil Court to Supreme Court pursuant to CPLR 325 (b). In addition to the plaintiff’s motion, the defendant moved to set aside the verdict as being grossly excessive. The issue now before this court is whether, after a verdict in a case before the Civil Court pursuant to CPLR 325 (d), the Civil Court has the jurisdiction to allow a plaintiff to increase the ad damnum clause in the complaint when the amount sought exceeds the Civil Court’s monetary jurisdiction.\\nRelying on CPLR 3025 (c), which provides that \"The court may permit pleadings to be amended before or after judgment to conform them to the evidence”, the plaintiff argues that the Civil Court, in this case, has the discretionary power to grant plaintiff’s motion and to allow an award in excess of the ad damnum clause. The plaintiff further relies on Loomis v Corinno Constr. Corp. (54 NY2d 18, 20), which held \"that a motion made by a plaintiff to increase the amount of relief requested in the ad damnum clause of the complaint, whether made before or after verdict, may be granted in the absence of prejudice to the defendant.”\\nIn addition to arguing against the jury verdict as being excessive so as to shock the conscience of the court, and not sufficiently supported by the evidence, the defendant also claims that the Civil Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to amend the ad damnum clause.\\nRelying on Lachman v Herdman (Civ Ct, Queens County 1980), defendant argues that upon removal to the lower court, CPLR 325 (d) should be construed to mean that the Civil Court has a monetary jurisdiction up to the amount conferred on it by the Supreme Court, the amount of the ad damnum clause in the complaint.\\nThe legislative purpose in enacting CPLR 325 (d) was to create a procedural device under which a higher court can freely transfer cases to lower courts of limited jurisdiction in order to reduce Trial Calendar congestion. When an action is transferred from the Supreme Court to the Civil Court pursuant to CPLR 325 (d), such removal is based upon a consideration by the court of the nature and the extent of the plaintiff’s injuries and his special damages.\\nCPLR 325 (d) states in part the following: \"If the action is so removed, then the verdict or judgment shall be subject to the limitation of monetary jurisdiction of the court in which the action was originally commenced and shall be lawful to the extent of the amount demanded within such limitation.”\\nEssentially, this language shows a legislative intent that the measure of a recovery in the transferee court may exceed its own monetary jurisdiction only, however, up to the amount demanded in the complaint. (Huston v Rao, 74 AD2d 127 [2d Dept 1980].) It was not the legislative intent that an action once removed to a lower court may not ever be retransferred, nor was the intent to give the lower court the unlimited monetary jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. The statute was written with an understanding that a case may warrant a return to the Supreme Court. (Huston v Rao, supra.)\\nWith respect to retransfer to the Supreme Court, CPLR 325 (b) provides: \"From court of limited jurisdiction. Where it appears that the court in which an action is pending does not have jurisdiction to grant the relief to which the parties are entitled, a court having such jurisdiction may remove the action to itself upon motion.”\\nIf it should appear that a plaintiffs recovery may reasonably exceed the amount stated in the ad damnum clause of his complaint, the plaintiffs recourse is to move in the Supreme Court for an order granting leave to increase the amount of the ad damnum clause, and, at the same time, he must move for a retransfer of that action to that court under CPLR 325 (b). (Huston v Rao, supra.)\\nWhen a plaintiff before the Civil Court on a CPLR 325 (d) case obtains a jury verdict greater than the amount in the ad damnum clause of the complaint, and he then seeks to increase the ad damnum clause, he must move to do so in Supreme Court. Such motion must be coupled with a motion for retransfer because such retransfer is required to afford the plaintiff a forum of greater monetary jurisdiction. He may then recover the damages to which he is entitled in a sum excess to the amount originally demanded in the complaint.\\nAccordingly, the motion by the plaintiff in this case cannot be entertained by this court. The Civil Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to rule on a motion to increase the ad damnum clause in a complaint above the amount demanded in the complaint when the case comes before the court under CPLR 325 (d). The proper procedure is for the plaintiff to make a motion pursuant to CPLR 325 (b) in Supreme Court, Kings County, for an order retransferring the case to Supreme Court. If the plaintiff is successful in retransferring the case to Supreme Court, he can then move to increase the ad damnum clause, however, if he is unsuccessful, the plaintiff must accept the limited jurisdiction conferred on the Civil Court and live within the limit of his ad damnum clause. The plaintiff’s motion for an order pursuant to CPLR 3025 (b) and (c) is denied, without prejudice. The plaintiff is free to make the proper motions in the Supreme Court.',\n",

       "       'text': 'OPINION OF THE COURT\\nMemorandum.\\nOrder affirmed, without costs.\\nThe issue presented on this appeal is whether the Civil Court may entertain a proceeding brought by a landlord seeking injunctive relief only.\\nLandlord commenced this proceeding by order to show cause and petition seeking an order directing tenant to provide landlord with access to the premises for the purpose of correcting violations and further directing tenant to prevent the recurrence of these violations. The petition alleged that tenant had installed a double cylinder key-operated lock in the apartment door in violation of the applicable provisions of the Administrative Code of the City of New York and the Multiple Dwelling Law, that as a result three violations had been placed against the premises, that landlord had caused the violations to be removed, that tenant had thereafter reinstalled the double cylinder lock, and that as a result three new violations had been placed. The petition further alleged that tenant had installed plywood boards in the fire escape windows in violation of the applicable provisions of the Administrative Code and the Multiple Dwelling Law but that no violations had yet been placed as a result of such installation. The petition named the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (DHPD) and tenant as respondents.\\nOn the return date, the lower court ruled that it lacked jurisdiction to issue the order sought by landlord in the absence of a prior court order directing landlord to correct the violations. The court stated that landlord’s remedy was to commence a holdover proceeding.\\nOn this appeal, landlord argues that the Civil Court has jurisdiction pursuant to the New York City Civil Court Act and the Administrative Code provisions examined below to grant the relief sought and that the granting of such relief, which is a less harsh remedy than eviction, should be preferred over requiring landlord to commence a holdover proceeding.\\nDHPD has submitted a brief in opposition which contends that there is no statutory authority permitting an owner to seek injunctive relief absent a pending proceeding and that the equity powers of the Civil Court are limited to those specifically conferred by statute.\\nFor the reasons set forth below, we hold that the Civil Court lacks the power to entertain the subject proceeding.\\nThe power of the Civil Court to issue injunctions is limited by CCA 209 (b) (see, Hotel New Yorker Pharmacy v New Yorker Hotel Corp., 40 AD2d 967; Ford v Tower W. Assocs., 120 Misc 2d 240). This provision states that no injunction shall issue out of the Civil Court except pursuant to certain specified statutes. The only one of the specified provisions relevant to this proceeding is article 53 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York (Housing Maintenance Code) which has been renumbered and now appears as title 27, chapter 2, subchapter 5, article 4 of the Administrative Code (Administrative Code § 27-2120 et seq.).\\nSubchapter 5 sets forth the legal remedies and enforcement procedures which are available for a breach of the substantive provisions of the code. Article 4 therein, the old article 53, is entitled \"Injunctive Relief’ and provides in pertinent part as follows:\\n\"ARTICLE 4\\n\"INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\\n\"§ 27-2120 Injunctions; mandatory and prohibitory. The department may institute an action in a court of competent jurisdiction for an order requiring the owner of property or other responsible person to abate or correct any violation of this code, or to comply with an order or notice of the department, or for such other relief as may be appropriate to secure continuing compliance with this code. An action for injunctive relief hereunder may be brought in addition to other sanctions and remedies for violations of the code, or may be joined with any action for such other sanctions and remedies except criminal prosecution.\\n\"§ 27-2121 Injunctive relief in other actions; powers of the court. In any action or proceeding brought in the housing part of the New York city civil court, the court, on motion of any party or on its own motion, may issue such preliminary, temporary or final orders requiring the owner of property or other responsible person to abate or correct violations of this code, or to comply with an order or notice of the department, or to take such other steps as the court may deem necessary to assure continuing compliance with the requirements of this code, including direction of correction of violations of this code by a contractor, materialman or municipal department and payment of rent or release of funds deposited with the court in an appropriate amount to (i) such contractor or material-man upon the proper presentation of bills for the correction of such conditions or (ii) such municipal department.” (Administrative Code §§ 27-2120, 27-2121.)\\nIt is clear from a reading of Administrative Code § 27-2120 that DHPD may commence an action for injunctive relief and it would follow pursuant to CCA 209 (b) that the Civil Court would have jurisdiction over such an action. At issue in the instant case is whether these provisions authorize a landlord to commence such an action or proceeding. Resolution of this issue must turn on the interpretation of Administrative Code § 27-2121.\\nAs we read it, Administrative Code § 27-2121 authorizes the court, only in a pending action or proceeding, to grant a motion for injunctive relief. By its terms, it does not authorize, and nothing is shown to make it appear that it was intended to authorize, the institution of an action or special proceeding for an injunction. The distinction is critical. As was long ago stated in Matter of Lima & Honeoye Falls Ry. Co. (68 Hun 252, 253) with respect to the difference between a motion and a special proceeding: \"a motion is an application in a proceeding — by action or otherwise — already pending or about to be commenced, upon which it depends for jurisdiction; whereas a special proceeding is an independent prosecution of a remedy, in which jurisdiction is obtained by original process.” Because we read Administrative Code § 27-2121 as authorizing only the granting by the court of a motion and not the institution of an action or proceeding for injunctive relief, we hold that the Civil Court is without jurisdiction over such a proceeding by a landlord (CCA 209 [b]). Insofar as the Civil Court opinion in Rosenthal v Heifer (136 Misc 2d 9) may hold to the contrary, we choose not to follow it.\\nWe further note that we find not only the jurisdiction of the Civil Court to be lacking but also the right of the landlord to maintain the subject proceeding to be lacking. In this regard, we note that CPLR 103 (b) requires that \"[a]ll civil judicial proceedings shall be prosecuted in the form of an action, except where prosecution in the form of a special proceeding is authorized.” For the reasons discussed above, we find no statute authorizing landlord to proceed by way of special proceeding. For this reason too, therefore, it appears to us that landlord’s attempt to create a summary remedy where none has been established by statute must fail.\\nMonteleone, J. P., Pizzuto and Williams, JJ., concur.',\n",
