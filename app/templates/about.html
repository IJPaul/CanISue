        Can I Sue is an application intended to help users make more informed legal decisions.
        Can I Sue leverages data from Harvard's Caselaw Access Project API (CAPAPI) as well as Reddit's legaladvice'
        subreddit (r/legaladvice).
        The cases retrieved from CAPAPI are meant to provide Can I Sue's users with insight into what sort of legal
        precedences have been set by past lawsuits, whereas r/legaladvice is meant to provide users with a means of
        seeking out helpful discussions that people with similar experiences have had.
        <br><br>
        In the "Search Cases" bar, the user may describe their legal situation or grievance. The more details that are
        provided, the more likely that Can I Sue is able to return highly relevant cases and discussions.
        For example, one may search: <br>
        "My neighbor has built a fence on my property." <br>
        as well as: <br>
        "fence built on my property" <br>
        although the former will retrieve results that are likely a bit more relevant.
        <br>
        There is also a drop-down calendar where the user can select the "Earliest Case Date." By default, Can I Sue
        will retrieve the most relevant cases from CAPAPI from any possible point in time, but if the user elects to set
        an "Earliest Case Date", Can I Sue will set a lower bound on the date of cases returned. This may be helpful if
        the user's current query is returning results whose legal precedence has become outdated due to age.
        <br>
        The "Jurisdiction" drop-down menu allows the user to choose what level of jurisdicition the court cases should
        have. By default, Can I Sue will look for cases from any court in the United States, but the user can narrow
        this search down so that only cases from a specific jurisdiction (e.g. New York or Arizona) are considered.
        <br>
        Note that search parameters other than the Search Bar are only applicable to CAPAPI results. Reddit results are
        only meant to be considered for discussion, and hold no legal precedence.
