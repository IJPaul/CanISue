And if they should convert the materials to their own use, they would not be liable to an action at the suit of the party who had placed the fence upon the lot, because, being a fixture, the fence would belong to the owner of the soil. Semble. Per Bronson, C. J. Error to the Orleans common pleas. Thayer sued Wright before a justice in trover for a quantity of rails; and the case was substantially as follows: In 1835, the plaintiff leased a lot 62 feet by 40, in the northwest corner of his farm, where two roads met, to the trustees of school district No. 24, in Murray and Barry. The lease was in perpetuity; but the property was to revert when it ceased to be used for a school house. A school house was built on the south side of the lot, fronting the east, with a privy in the rear, which had stood there for ten years and more, and a school was kept in the house. There had been a fence separating the school lot on the west from the farm, which was built by the plaintiff; but it had fallen into decay. In April, 1846, the plaintiff built three lengths of rail fence on the school lot, extending from the northwest corner of the lot to the northwest corner of the school house, This cut off all communication, so that the school children could only get to the privy by climbing over the fence. This fence, or some other, was necessary to prevent cattle from coming on to the farm. The defendant-was a trustee of the district at the time; and about two months after the fence was built, he, with another trustee, removed the fence which the plaintiff put up to the place where the old division fence between the lot and the farm had stood. The plaintiff was present and forbid the removal. Plaintiff said he had called upon the trustees to build the fence. There was no proof that they were bound to build. The justice denied a motion for a nonsuit ; and gave judgment for the plaintiff for 25 cents damages, besides costs. On certiorari, the common pleas reversed the judgment. The plaintiff brings error.

       "  'case_summary': \"ROWLAND v. BAIRD. Montgomery County Court, Trial Term; December, 1886. 1. Division fences, how constructed.] A division line fence is not legally required to be built of any particular height or size, or of any particular materials or particular style; but it must be so built as to size, height, and character, and kind of materials-, that it will be proper and suitable for all the purposes of such fence, and will be reasonably safe, and not necessarily cause injury to the property or animals of the adjoining owner. 2. The same; liability for injury to animal.] In an action between owners of adjoining farms for injuries to plaintiff’s horse in getting upon a barbed-wire fence built by defendant, it is immaterial to the defendant’s liability that the fence was not built upon the division line, but was built near the line and on the defendant’s own property. i*8. Thesame.] A fence erected and maintained upon or near the division •line of such a dangerous character as to cause serious injury and damage to the animals of an adjoining owner that come in contact with it, is a nuisance, rendering the owner who erects and maintains the fence liable for such injuries. 4. The same; knowledge of danger.] Although mere negligence of the adjoining owner in failing to learn of the existence of the dange: ous fence would not defeat his recovery in such case, yet if he knew of its existence, and by his own gross negligence permitted his animal to be injured, the defendant is not liable therefor. 6. 'Whether the fence a nuisance a question for the jury.] In such an action it is a question for the jury to determine whether a barbed-wire fence occasioning the injury was a nuisance or not, taking into consideration all the circumstances, including its style, size, height, material, location, and the knowledge of both parties as to its objects and the use of the adjoining lands on each side. 0. Measure of damages for injuries to animal.] The measure of damages for injury to plaintiff’s horse in such case is the difference between the market value of the horse before and after the injury. The amount of money expended for medicines, and the value of plaintiff’s services in caring for the horse after the injury, are not proper items of damage. Trial before Hon. Zerak S. Westbrook, county judge, presiding, and a jury. The action was brought to recover damages for injuries to plaintiff’s horse in jumping upon a sharp barbed-wire fence erected between the adjoining farms of the parties by the defendant, and being a part of the line fence that he was bound to maintain. The plaintiff sought to recover on two grounds; first, that the defendant was guilty of negligence in building and maintaining an improper and dangerous fence; and, second, that the fence was a nuisance. The defence was a general denial. The substantial facts are stated in the charge of the court given below. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for $125. A motion for a new trial upon the judge’s minutes was denied. Robert J. Sanson for the plaintiff. Charles S. Nisbit for the defendant. * The statutes of many of the States expressly regulate height and materials. By L. 1854, c. 282, § 8, “a sufficient post and wire fence of requisite height shall be deemed a lawful fence,” within the statute as to fencing by railroad companies.\",\n",

       "  'case_summary': \"Smith versus Johnson. 1. One of two adjoining owners of land is not bound to put his fence on the line unless he occupies up to it. 2. He may set his fence in on his own land and throw open to the public the land between his line and the fence, and thus be relieved from assisting to maintain a line fence. 3. Building a fence entirely on his own land does not authorize the owner to remove any portion of a line fence, that had been previously erected. 4. A line fence is the common property of the adjoining landholders, and the materials are so dedicated to the realty, that either removing them without the consent of the other is liable in trespass. 5. The defendant built his fence near the line on his own land and removed part of a line fence between him and the plaintiff, leaving a gap into the plaintiff’s field. Held, that it was the duty of the plaintiff to protect his crops by building proper fences in a reasonable time ; otherwise the defendant would not be liable for damage done by the cattle of others. 6. In closing the gap, the plaintiff had no right to extend his fence over on the defendant’s land, even a few feet — but by so doing became a trespasser ; the defendant had the right to throw down that portion of the fence on his land, and no action lay against him although his motives were malicious. 7. Dysart v. Leeds, 2 Barr 488 ; Jenkins v. Fowler, 12 Harris 308 ; Stoner v. Hunsicker, 11 Wright 513, followed. May 20th 1874. Before Sharswood, Williams, Merour and Gordon, JJ. Error to the Court of Common Pleas of Juniata county: Of-May Term 1874, No. 76. This was an action of trespass q. c. f., brought April 14th 1873, by Richard Johnson against David Smith. The defendant and one John Thompson were owners of adjoining farms; the plaintiff was the tenant of Thompson. Thompson and the defendant had some dispute about repairing their partition fence, which extended southwardly from the northern corner of their farms to the north side of a turnpike which passed east and west through both farms, and then from the south side of the turnpike southwardly to the south corner of their farms at the Pennsylvania Canal. After some unsuccessful efforts to adjust the dispute, the defendant erected a fence on his land for the entire line and a few feet from it. In making this fence he used what he called his part of the original fence, and its removal left a gap into Thompson’s field at the turnpike. Thompson, or the plaintiff as his tenant, closed the gap by a fence along the turnpike and connected it with the fence made by the defendant on his land. The defendant took down the fence so made by plaintiff after it had been erected several times. Johnson alleged that by reason of the opening thus made, cattle, &ci, got into his field and injured his crops. The damages claimed were for the removal and appropriation of the original line fence, the injury to the field, crops, &c. The cause came on for trial December 5th 1873, before Junkin, P. J.' The plaintiff testified that he occupied Thompson’s farm by a written lease for three years ending in the spring of 1874 ; he testified also that the defendant had removed the fence, &c.; that by the removal of the fence he left a gap through which cattle went into the farm occupied by the plaintiff; the gap made was about three panels of fence; plaintiff then “ put in two posts and built a fence on Thompson’s land and alongside the fence built by Smith, until the two fences got so close and parallel, and then I stuck in poles to close up, so that whilst the poles came to the line, they did not go over it, and thus the cattle were prevented from getting in. * * * After I had built it up, a panel and a half were taken away; one sawed in two; about ten days after this the other half-panel disappeared. I built it up again, and the rails were taken away again in about one week. Then I made sixty-five new rails, and built a fence along the line, but on Thompson’s land seven panels, and that was thrown down. I built it up again; it was thrown down again; * * * in this way he threw it down five or six times.” Plaintiff testified that he had sustained a loss of $500 by cattle getting into his field. • Levi Myers testified: “ I live on David Smith’s farm; I have lived there since 6th March ; I threw down this fence four times; Mr. D. Smith told me whenever they should build on him to throw down the fence; the old line he showed me, and told me whenever they built across that line I should take it away; I took this fence away three times; Smith told me not to cross the line; I pushed the rails oyer; I touched no rails on Thompson’s land at any time; Smith lives three miles from this fence ; I think the points extended over about two feet, or may be more; when shoved over it left a gap that a cow could go through.” Thompson, the landlord, testified that after disputes and negotiations about the fence, he and the defendant had agreed upon what part of the line fence each should make, and they set in a stone to fix the point of division. There was evidence for the plaintiff by Dunn and others that there had been an agreement between Thompson and defendant fixing what part of the fence each was to make; also that the original fence had been some feet over on Thompson’s land, with other evidence in support of his'case. The defendant gave evidence that the fence built by him was entirely on his own land, and that the fence put up by plaintiff to close the gap connected with his and was on his land. The defendant testified that in 1864 he moved to this farm, and was told by Thompson that defendant’s portion of the fence to make was from the canal to some distance above the turnpike; that he had made and repaired that part. After plaintiff came to Thompson’s farm, he refused to repair the other part of the fence, and in consequence cattle, &c., got into plaintiff’s fields; defendant then took half of all the line fence which he had built, because he thought he had the right to do so. He then built the fence from the canal up to the turnpike on his own land and set it all on his own side; this left a gap at the turnpike. The gap was closed, and the plaintiff requested defendant to let it remain till he got his crops in. Defendant did not disturb it till plaintiff got his crop away, and then he notified plaintiff that he wanted all his ground. “ In the first place, what was on my ground I threw down; was very careful to lay nothing on their ground'; would take a panel down; he would build it up. He cut poles thirty feet long and I sawed them off; told Myers he should not go over the line, but only on our own land. Never threw that post fence down; left that stand. Where I sawed it down, a gap of four feet was left. I upset the fence that was on me; never threw anything down on Thompson’s land; sawed down on my land.” Levi Myers testified for defendant: “ Smith asked me to go to Johnson’s. Johnson asked if the fence might remain until the crop was out. Smith told him that he would let the fence stay until his crop was off.” The court charged:— “ We take the law to be this: that under Act of 11th March 1842, sect. 3, the improvers of adjacent lands may join in a division or line fence, and when either fails in his duty in keeping it in repair, the township auditors are made ex-officio viewers, &e. Notwithstanding this act, however, a man was not compelled to join in such fence, for if he chose he might build his own fence entirely within his own land, and the adjoiner cannot cross over, and connect therewith; and after adjoiners have thus united in the erection of a common division line fence, still if it afterwards be destroyed by flood, fire or decay, either party may recede within his own lines and build for himself. It would result from this, that whether, or not, when a common division line fence has been once established, and still exists, it is in the power of either party to build a new fence within his own lines — it is very certain that he cannot remove the existing fence, and place it within his own lines, without being guilty of a trespass, because he does not own it, except in common with his neighbor. In case of its destruction, each is permitted to do, what either could have done at the beginning, to wit, build his own fence upon his own land; but he must build with his own materials, and cannot use any part of the line fence. However, it is beyond all peradventure, that where such adjoining owners themselves agree to divide the line fence between them for repairs, each taking a section thereof, the removal of any part thereof by one of them upon his own ground, would be a trespass upon the land of the other. “Now, applying these principles to this case, if you find this was a line fence, and it is admitted to have been such for more than forty years, then Smith could not remove it back upon his own ground; he could not have done so, even in the absence of any agreement between him and Thompson, by which Smith was to keep that part in repair from pike to river; and Thompson from pike round to corner on the ridge. But, if you find such an agreement was made between them in 1864, as proved by Thompson and Dunn, by which the repairs were so divided, still less could Smith remove this fence. So that in either aspect of the case, Smith committed a trespass when he did so, and set it back from the line upon his own ground. In no aspect did more than half this fence belong to Smith, and this, too, an undivided half, so that every rail that Smith removed belonged to the extent of one-half thereof to Thompson, and their removal was an undoubted trespass. “ Johnson, the plaintiff, is the tenant of Thompson, the owner of the farm, and in possession; is the proper party to sue, and recover the damages; he can settle with his landlord for his interest. “ Then, as this removal of the fence by Mr. Smith was unlawful, he is liable for all the damage which naturally flowed from his wrongful act, to the plaintiff (Johnson) who was in possession <of the adjoining farm belonging to Mr. Thompson. These damages embrace the injury from the loss of the fence, thus transferred from the common ownership of both the adjoining owners, to Smith alone; also the injury to the crop of Johnson by the trespass of cattle, coming in through the gap, which the removal of this fence opened between the two farms, along the pike; in short, for all the direct and expected consequences arising from the wrongful act. True it is, however, that Smith is not liable for any damage or injury resulting from negligence on the part of Johnson in neglecting to repair the fence so as to close up the gap as soon as could reasonably be done — that is, if Johnson, after discovering that his fields of wheat and corn, or whatever else, were thereby exposed to the range of stock coming in, and trespassing, neglected to repair, or close it up, Smith should not be made to pay for such negligence. [But should you find that, as often as ■Johnson .did repair, Smith again destroyed it, and thus between these times stock got upon his crops, then Smith is clearly liable •to pay for such injury.] Again, the law in cases of this kind .adopts as the measure of damages, compensation quite equal to the injury, loss and trouble sustained; but this rule yields to circumstances, so that, in cases of wanton, malicious and aggravated trespasses, attended with acts showing an intention to do great injury, and permits exemplary or punitive damages to be given; that is such damages as punish the trespasser by making him pay more than the mere sum, which makes good the injury to the suffering party. [The original act of Mr. Smith, in removing this line fence, in itself, if done under a misapprehension of his duty, believing he had the right to do so, does not indicate a malicious purpose; but his subsequent conduct in removing, or causing to be removed, all the means taken by Johnson to preserve his crop, such as cutting off or throwing down the rails which very harmlessly pointed, if at all, but slightly, over the line, is difficult to explain, and inclines the mind strongly to the belief, that his motives were not commendable. All these things you must take into consideration, and assess such damages, as under all the circumstances you feel and believe to be just and proper under the evidence.] “Defendant’s counsel asks us to instruct you that, if this fence was only a division fence by agreement of Thompson and Smith, by each agreeing to keep a specific part in repair, and it is found, as a matter of fact, that Thompson had neglected his part to such an extent that repairs.became necessary, that then Smith could remove the fence within his own lines without being liable as a trespasser. But the facts show that the removed fence was not a partition fence by agreement between Smith and Thompson; it had always been the line fence between the two farms, and the utmost extent of the agreement proved by Thompson and Dunn was to fix each one’s part to be.kept up, [so that after all the question is simply one of damages.] How much shall the plaintiff recover for the injury he has sustained, as already explained. Besides, in eases of partition fences, the whole matter is regulated by the Act of 11th March 1842, which provides the manner of compelling each to do his duty, or paying the one who does the whole, so that in no aspect can this trespass be justified.” The verdict was for the plaintiff for $420. The defendant took a writ of error. He assigned the following errors:— 1, 8, 4. The portions of the charge in brackets. 2. “ The court misled the jury by reviewing and emphasizing the evidence of plaintiff as stated in the first specification of error, on the subject of malice, and failing to notice in any way the facts in evidence which disproved malice on the part of the defendant, as follows: That Johnson asked Smith to permit the gap to remain closed until he gathered his crop, and that Smith did as requested.” H:D. Parher, for plaintiff in error. The general rule to measure damages in tort is compensation: Seely v. Alden, 11 P. F. Smith 302. A man may abandon an old partition fence and build a new one on his own land: Painter v. Reece, 2 Barr 126; Rohrer v. Rohrer, 6 Harris 368. If the court charge so as to review those facts only which tend to establish one side of a case, it is calculated to mislead a jury and is error: Parker v. Donaldson, 6 W. & S. 132; Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. Berry, 18 P. F. Smith 272. H. S. Doty, for defendant in error.\",\n",

Ibid. — Ibid.—Eminent Domain. — Such exemption is not the taking of property within the exempted territorial limits either for a public or private purpose, in the sense of the Constitution of 1868 or 1895, although the principal effect of the statute is to convert the lands therein into a common pasture. 3. Ibid. — Ibid.—Ibid.—Condemnation.—The requirements of the acts of 1886 and 1887 exempting portions of Chesterfield County from operations of stock law, that the residents within the exempted section should build and keep in good repair a fence along the lines therein described, was unconstitutional, because it was for a private purpose and was taking the property of those upon whose lands the fence was required to be built, and that of the residents within said section, without compensation and without their consent. 4.

Ibid. — Ibid.—An act giving to commissioners the power to include or exclude such persons as they think proper from territory exempt from the provisions of the general stock law is unconstitutional. Before Gary, J., Chesterfield, April, 1901. Affirmed. Action by Alexander Goodale et al. against Ervin Sowell et al. The Circuit decree is as follows: “This is an action on the equity side of the Court, for an injunction, brought by the plaintiffs as taxpayers and citizens of that section of Chesterfield County embraced in the act of the General Assembly of this State, exempting said section from the provisions of the general stock law. The action is against certain commissioners created under and by the act of 1899, page 172, entitled 'An act to provide for commissioners to superintend the stock law fence around that portion of Chesterfield County exempted 'from the operation of the stock law, and to provide for the maintenance of the said fence, and to punish parties destroying or Injuring it,’ to enjoin said commissioners from repairing and reconstructing said fence around said section, and from approving accounts for the building of the said fence and making further contracts for said work, and also against the county treasurer, I. P. Mangum, enjoining him from paying out funds in his hands for said purpose, and to enjoin the board of county commissioners from approving accounts for such work, and giving orders on the county treasurer for the payment of such accounts. The contention of the plaintiffs is, that the act of 1899, as well as the previous acts of the General Assembly exempting certain portions of Chesterfield County, are unconstitutional in the following particulars: 1st. Private property is taken for the use of private purposes, without the consent of the owners, or without making just compensation therefor. 2d. That they tend to abridge the privileges and immunities of citiezns of this State, and to deprive person^ of their property without due process of law, and to deny to persons within the State the equal protection of the laws. 3d. That the act of 1899 is unconstitutional, in that it seeks to except certain persons from an exemption granted to others of the same class in the same territory, under like circumstances, by leaving it to the arbitrary will of the commissioners created by said act, whether they will allow any particular persons of this class to come within the exemption, which they may refuse or deny to another. Also, in that said provision operates unequally upon persons within its territorial limits of the same class, by allowing (if the commissioners see fit to do so), those who can afford to make an extra fence, to put themselves within or without the exempted section of said county. “To better comprehend the issues involved, it will be ne cessary to give a brief history of the legislation on this exempted section. In 1886, the General Assembly enacted an act, which provided that this section of said county should be exempt from the provisions of the general stock law: Provided, That the residents of said section ‘shall build and keep in good repair a fence along the lines above described, such fence to be fully five feet high at every point, if built of rails; also to be well staked and ridered and sufficiently strong and close to protect the lands outside of said territory from the invasions of all stock and animals mentioned in the general stock law.’ The act further provided that ‘this exemption shall not take effect till said fence is compléted, and shall cease as soon as there is a failure to keep said fence up at any point: Provided, further, That-said fence be completed on or before the 1st day of January, 1889; and in case of failure to complete it'by that time that then this exemption shall not apply.’ Acts 1887-89. “In the agreed statement of facts used at the hearing of the cause appears the following: ‘That the fence provided for in the acts of 1886 and 1887 was never built in respect to height, in compliance with the terms of the said acts, nor has the same as built been maintained at all times — at times the said fence having been completely down along most of the line, and at places there has been no fence for several years; but the inhabitants all acquiesced in and acted upon the exemption with the fence as built until within the past five years.’ That the commissioners under the act of 1899 are building and threatening to continue to build the fence around the sections purporting to be exempt from the general stock law. That no compensation has been paid, or provided by law to be paid, for the right of way for the enclosure, nor for the use of the land enclosed. That a large portion of the residents of the section purported to be exempt are farmers, who raise stock, and a comparatively small per cent, of the land is under cultivation. That when this portion of the country was first exempted from the provisions of the stock law under acts 1886 and 1887, no objec tion was made to the proposed exemption, and a large majority of them consented either expressly or tacitly to same, and all acted under said exemption in good faith until within the last five years, but numbers of them now object; and other parties who have moved into said section and bought property there never have consented, but object to same. The fence as built under acts 1886 and 1887 was located only on lands of persons consenting to same, and the commissioners appointed under the act of 1899 do not propose to build the fence on the land of any who object to such location. It is further agreed, that a small number of persons owning property in the section purporting to be exempt objected to the exemption prior to the act of 1899, and the line of the old fence is now on the lands of some of these parties, but it was consented to when placed there by parties then owning the land. Under the above as the existing facts, both parties desire to test the constitutionality of the several acts of the General Assembly herein referred to. By a consent order, the claims for building fence up to the commencement of the suit have been paid.’ “By a comparison of the acts of 1886 and 1887, it will be seen that the provisions of the two acts are very similar. The act of 1887 changing somewhat the course of the fence, which was also required to be five feet high at every point, but was not required to be staked and ridered as in the first act. The following exemption, however, is found in both acts: ‘that this exemption shall not take effect until said fence is completed, and shall cease as soon as there is a failure to keep said fence up at any point.’ It is admitted that such a fence as the act prescribed was not built, nor was the same built within the time limited by said act. A fence was, however, built to which the residents of that section made no objection, and a large majority of them acquiesced in the same for a while. Since that time, however, the fence has not been kept up, and a portion of the time it has been down completely for several years, and I believe has been destroyed (as stated in argument) by fire. This state of affairs existed till 1899, when the General Assembly passed an act under which the commissioners are now operating, the purpose of which was the rebuilding, repairing and reconstructing the old fence. At this stage of the case my conclusion is, that the exemption-from the provisions of the general stock law, contemplated by the acts of 1886 and 1887, were conditional, and those conditions not having been complied with, there was no exemption. Those acts expressly provide ‘that this exemption shall not take effect until said fence is .completed, and shall cease as soon as there is a failure to keep said fence up at every point. It being admitted that the fence was not built within the time nor in compliance with the terms of the act, there was no exemption under the same. If, however, it -is contended that there was a substantial compliance, in which the citizens in that section of the county acquiesced, they would still have the right to now object, for the reason that the act provides that such exemption ‘shall cease as soon as there is a failure to keep said fence up at any point.’ The commissioners created under the act of 1899- are constituted ‘commissioners to superintend and repair and reconstruct the fence around that portion of Chesterfield County which is exempt from the stock law,’ virtually admitting that at -the time of the passage of said act the fence had not been kept up as contemplated by the previous acts. “Having reached the conclusion that the plaintiffs have not so acquiesced or consented to the exemption as the establishment of the fence under the acts of 1886-7, as to estop them from maintaining this action, we are now confronted with the real issue in the case. Are the acts unconstitutional ? In the agreed statement of facts we find the follow- ■ ing: ‘That no compensation has been paid, or provided by law to be paid, for the right of way for the enclosure, nor for the use of the land enclosed.’ And yet the act provides that the commissioners ‘shall determine where said fence shall be located, and shall have the right to enter and have it built where they order it -to be built.’ On the very face of the act, it seems to me that authority is given to said commissioners to take and appropriate private property for a private purpose, without the consent of the owner and without any compensation being first paid or provided to be paid, and is in derogation of art. I., sec. 25, of the Constitution of 1868, which provides: ‘Private property shall not be taken for public use, or for the use of corporations, or for private use without the consent of the owner, or a just compensation being made therefor.1 The Constitution of 1895 is to the same effect. Art. I., sec. 17: ‘Private property shall not be taken for private use without the consent of the owner, nor for public use without just compensation first being made.’ Our own case of Fort v. Goodwin, 36 S. C., 453, is directly in point. I quote from the syllabus: ‘An act of the legislature cannot authorize land to be taken for the building of a fence to increase a pasture in a section of a county for the supposed benefit of those persons who own land within the pasture limits — certainly not without the consent of the owners or unless a just compensation be made therefor, even though the pasture be so determined upon by a vote of two-thirds of the freehold voters residing within those limits, at an election held for the purpose under statutory authority.’ “In the agreed statement of facts it is stated that both parties desire to test the constitutionality of the several acts of the General Assembly referred to. The parties having signified this desire, I think it proper that I should consider another phase of the act of 1899. Under the provisions of that act the commissioners are given the power to discriminate between persons in the same territorial limits, in the same circumstances. This power is given by the expressed terms of the act: ‘they (the commissioners) shall have the right to allow parties living on the inside who desire to be allowed to be placed on the outside, or parties living on the outside who desire to be included within said fence, to be included or excluded, as the case may be, on their making the extra fence required to include or exclude them.’ In the recent case of Hill v. City Council of Abbeville, 59 S. C., 415, the license ordinance of the city of Abbeville was attacked as being unconstitutional in numerous particulars; the seventh allegation of the complaint in that case alleged ‘That the license ordinance is also illegal and void, and contrary to sec. 5, of art. L, of the Constitution of this State, in that said ordinance provides “That no- person, firm or corporation shall engage in, prosecute or -carry on any trade, business, occupation or profession hereinafter mentioned, without first having paid a special license tax therefor, to wit: etc,.,” and section 4 of said ordinance provides 'as follows : ‘The city council hereby reserves the right to refuse or revoke any license for any cause which may seem to it just;’ thus putting it in the power of the citjr council of Abbeville to abridge the privileges of the citizens of said city and deprive them of their liberty and property without due process of law, and to deny to any one that they may see fit the equal-protection of the laws,’ and Justice Pope, in- commenting upon said paragraph, said: T think that section is, as alleged, invalid and illegal. The city council legislates by way of ordinance, and can only ordain such ordinances as the law permits them to make. There is no law authorizing said council to revoke any license for any cause which may seem to it just. There may be causes, legal causes, for which council might revoke a license, but certainly “any cause,” which in its opinion, irrespective of law, may seem to it “just,” is beyond the power, and, therefore, without warrant of law. But this is a speculative question. Council has not refused or revoked any license for any cause which seemed to it just. It will be time enough to consider such refusal or revocation when that issue is presented. Again, this section 4 may be stricken out and it would not destroy the entire ordinance, nor seriously interfere with the enforcement of said ordinance.’ On appeal the decree of Judge Aldrich was affirmed. “It is, therefore, ordered, that the temporary order of injunction heretofore granted in this cause be continued of force and made perpetual, and the injunction prayed for in the complaint be granted. It is further ordered, that inasmuch as I have been notified that there was an agreement of council depending on the result of this decree, that leave is hereby granted to effectuate the same at the foot of this decree, should they be so advised.” From this order the defendants appeal.

Homestead.—When the owner of a parcel of land in a town or city occupied by him as the homestead of his family permanently devotes a part thereof to a purpose inconsistent with its use as a part of the homestead and permanently abandons such use, the parcel so set apart for other than homestead uses ceases to he a part of the homestead. See facts. 2. Same.—Though no divisional lines may have been run separating the original parcel of ground into lots, the building of a dividing fence between the portion of ground permanently devoted to other than homestead purposes and that part still occupied for homestead use sufficiently marks the portion protected as a home by the Constitution and that portion which has been abandoned as part of the homestead and which has become thereby subject to forced sale. See opinion and statement for facts held to constitute abandonment of part of lots once used as a homestead. Appeal from Johnson. Tried below before Hon. J. M. Hall. The following was the testimony of appellee Maxey: “Is sixty-nine years old, and resides upon property in controversy; family consists of wife, self, and a little boy; his homestead consists of a part of out block No. 2 in city of Cleburne; bought and resided on it in July, 1867; bought' the whole block and enclosed it with a fence in 1867, and built near center of it, fronting on head of Caddo Street, and has always resided on the block since. After I bought I sold a lot off the east end of the block to Mrs. Armstead, and after that I sold off to A. A. Barnes a lot off the west end of the block and retained that portion lying between the Beard and Barnes lots; the part retained by me fronts on Willingham Street 212 feet [the plat shows 205] and runs back 210 feet. This block has never been subdivided; the chain was never put to it. Soon after I sold to Barnes I made a garden just .west of the house in which I then lived and just east of the Barnes lot, the full length of the block, and built a fence north and south the length of the block and west of the house I was then occupying. I built this fence to keep the chickens out of the garden, and had a gate made in this fence so I could get into the garden. In 1888 Mrs. Pickett came to Cleburne and wanted to keep boarders and send her children to school. The house I was occupying was not large enough for myself and wife and her family, and I built the house in which I now reside upon the spot I had used before then for a garden, and moved into it and have resided there since. I rented the old house to Mrs. Pickett and boarded with her during the time she remained. After she left I rented the old house to Mrs. Muckleroy and we took our meals with her while she remained there. She remained about six months and then I rented the old house to Parson Beverly. I had up to that time been renting the place for eighteen dollars, but on account of he being a preacher I knocked off 82 a month. He kept it about two years and then Mr. Alleridge rented it. He paid me 814 a month. After he left it I rented it to Mr. Lyons, who has been renting it about a year at $16.50 a month. “In 1879 I built another house on the block just southeast of the old house to rent to S. C. Walters, and he occupied it for two years. After he left I rented to Mayor and then to C. R. Porter, and after he left I rented it to others. Since last spring Mr. Wells', the present occupant, has been renting it. This house has rented at from $12.50 to $16.50 per month. During the time Walters occupied the house he put up a board fence from near the northwest corner of the house to the back part of the lot, and built a cow shed in the horse lot, but no fence was extended south till after Mr. Lyons went into the old house. He complained of Mayor’s children bothering him, and I built the fence from the southwest’ corner of the new house south to the front fence, simply for the accommodation of Mr. Lyons. The fence between the old house and the Walters house begins at the front fence and runs back north to a point opposite the northwest corner of the house, and then an' offset the distance of one panel to the southwest corner of the house, and then the fence begins about three feet from the northwest corner of the house and runs to the corner of the smoke house belonging to the old house, passing over the cistern and connecting with the cistern, leaving a pass-way over the cistern, and leaving the cistern so that water can be drawn from either side; and from northeast corner of smoke house the fence runs on back to north side of the block or southwest corner of the horse lot. This cistern was built by me when I built the old house, and have used drinking water out of it all the time since I moved into the house where I now reside except when it was dry last summer; and in getting water I pass through the gate in the fence between my residence and the old house. “I have prepared a rough draft or sketch of my property, showing the position of the several houses and fences. [It will be found copied in the opinion.] The first house on the west side, as shown on the plat, is my residence, and the dotted line east of this is the old garden fence and is so marked, and the cross-mark in the line is the gate leading to the old house, and through this I pass to get my drinking water from the cistern. This piece of ground is about 90 feet front by 210 deep. The next house east on this plat is intended to represent the old house. This piece of ground is about 65 feet front by 210 feet back, and the round dot on the east of the old house is intended to represent the cistern. The house east of this is intended to represent the Walters house, and the dotted line the fence between the old house and the Walters house. “This block has never been subdivided, and I have always claimed the whole of this part block as shown on this plat as my residence, and so claim it now. It is the only property I own on earth. I have no occupation and my only means of support is the rent from the old house and the Walters house. I have not had any occupation since W. L. Williams beat me for county clerk. I built the Walters house a purpose to rent out. * * * The guttering of the old was used also for supplying the cistern until it was broken down. The other portion of the fence separating the old house and the Walters house from each other begins on the north side of the cistern and runs in a northwest direction until it reaches the southeast corner of the smoke house belonging to the old house, and then it stopped again and then begins again at the northeast corner of the smoke house and runs straight to the horse lot. This fence was built by S. C. Walters while he lived in the east house, out of piano boxes. He built it ou his own accord; never asked my permission. There is a small gate in front of each house, but there is but one wagon gate, that is at the east corner, next to Mrs. Baird’s; you can enter that gate and go straight north until you reach the horse lot at the southeast corner of it, and there is a large gate through which you can pass into the horse lot, and there in the west fence of the lot is another gate, as indicated on the drawing, through which you can pass. I then go across to the back portion of that portion of the lot on which he resides, and that is the only way by which you can reach that portion of the lot which is in the rear of the house in which he lives.” Cross-examined. “ My residence cost me at first about $800, and since then I have made some small additions to it; it consisted at first of four rooms, but now has six; we have a flower pit and garden in front yard, and a privy in back part of yard; we have a front gate entering Willing-ham Street. About three years ago when the city constructed its system of waterworks I became a subscriber and had water brought to my house, mainly to water my flowers, but we have used it also for general purposes; when we felt like it we would get our drinking water at the cistern at the old house, and we sometimes when there was no water in the cistern got our drinking water from Captain Barnes. We have resided exclusively in the house where we now do for about nine years, and have at no time resided in either of the other houses since 1878, when I rented to Mr. Lyon. I did not reserve the right or privilege of getting water out of the cistern, nor did I reserve any right to control the place. The old house has five rooms in it and a smoke house and privy in back yard; I have rented this house out ever since I built my residence, but took my meals there a part of the time as stated. The Walters house cost me about $600, but some small additions were made by Walters while he was there; he also built a cow shed and a chicken coop; this place has a front yard and gate, and also a large gate for wagons to pass back to lot; it has a back yard and lot; have rented this place out since 1879 to various parties; built the house for that purpose. I have never reserved any rights or privileges when renting this place, but all have used cistern. All of these houses front on Willingham Street. Have never paid anything on judgment of F. M. Sansom.” Re-examined. “At the time I built my residence and Walters house I was not in debt; that part of the block owned by me at the time I first built upon it was worth about $600, and is now worth with all three houses about $3000. The judgment upon which the execution in this case issued was obtained on a note executed by W. H. Graves and myself as sureties for S. C. Walters.” Two other witnesses (Lyons and Wells) testified, but their evidence disclosed nothing which is not contained in testimony of appellee, and there was no conflict of testimony. W. Poindexter, for appellants. The court erred in that part of his charge wherein this language is used, viz.: “The court instructs you that if you believe from the evidence that the plaintiff has built and is occupying as a home any certain house upon the land described in the petition, and if you further find that he has built any one or more houses upon said land.not for the purpose of occupying the same as a home, but for the purpose of renting the same permanently so as to derive a revenue therefrom, and has separated the land on which such building, if any, is erected from the remainder of the land by building a fence around such house, then you will as to such property built for such purpose find that the same is not a part of the homestead of plaintiff,” etc. For two reasons, viz., first, by this charge the right of defendants to subject any of said property to sale under their execution levy was made to depend on the sole fact that plaintiff had built a house thereon for the exclusive purpose of renting the same permanently; second, by this charge the right of defendants to have any part of the property sold under their execution was made to depend upon the fact that plaintiff had separated such property from the remainder thereof by building a fence around the house on such property; whereas the law is that if the plaintiff had fixed his homestead upon a certain part of the property and separated it from the remainder, and had permanently rented out such remainder to tenants, then such permanent renting divested such remainder of its homestead character regardless of the original purpose or intent with which plaintiff put the buildings thereon, .and regardless of whether plaintiff built a fence around such building thereon or not.

The verdict of the jury was right and the judgment of the court in all things was and is correct for the following reasons: 1. The evidence shows that the property described and in controversy was and is a part of the homestead of appellee. 2. The property in controversy was the homestead of appellee before the same was levied on by appellants, and had been used by appellee as his homestead since July, 1867, and had never been abandoned by him, and -was still used as such.

Where the plaintiff in an action against a railway company for damages for the burning of a rail fence testified that since the fire he had built a wire fence, and was in as good condition financially as before the fire, he may properly be asked what was the entire cost of constructing the wire fence in the place of the old one. Pleas-ants, Justice, dissenting, S. Same—Same—Measure of Damages. The measure of damages for the burning of a rail fence is not the actual market value of the fence at the time, but it is the value of the fence as an inclosure of plaintiff’s land; and this is to be arrived at after a comparison of the respective costs of rail and wire fences, where the evidence shows that a wire fence will place plaintiff in as good condition. Appeal from the County Court of Washington. Tried below before Hon. E. P. Curry. J. W. Terry and Chas. K. Lee, for appellant. The material inquiry in this ease was the value of the fence—not the value of the material contained therein, and the trouble of building it. The property destroyed was valuable, not as rails, but as fence. While at some earlier date, this fence—because there was no other kind as serviceable that could be made cheaper—might have been worth the value of the rails and the cost of putting it up, if a character of fence equally as good has since such date been devised, which can be put up more cheaply, that fact would necessarily decrease the value of the rail fence. On the question what was the value of the rail fence, it was relevant to show the value of other styles and characters of fence that would serve the same purposes as well as the rail. 1 Sedgwick on Damages, p. 84 et seq.; Railway v.

       "  'case_summary': 'Benjamin Wright against Martin Wright: IN ERROR. Where the plaintiff in an action, founded on the 8th section of the statute concerning Fences, to recover the sum awarded to him, by the fence-viewers, alleged, that he and the defendant were owners of enclosed lands, separated by a stone-wall, which was originally built, entirely, by W, under whom the plaintiff holds, and which, in consequence of a division of the land, in July, 1826, it became the duty of the defendant to unite with the plaintiff in dividing, and to pay the plaintiff such sum as should be awarded, by the fence-viewers; it was held, that the fence-viewers, on the plaintiff’s application, had power and right to divide and apportion the fence anew. Where it further appeared, from a plea of the defendant, that W, and those whose estate he had, and the plaintiff now has, for more than thirty years before July, 1826, were accustomed to make and maintain such wall, at their own cost, without expense to the defendant, or to those whose estate he has; it was held, 1. that these facts did not constitute a prescription, binding upon the plaintiff, being at most only evidence of one; 2. that such usage was not of the nature of a covenant which runs with the land, through all time, but was temporary, governing only the immediate owners and the land as it then was. It is a legal incident or appurtenance, attached per se to all lands enclosed and holden in severalty, running with them perpetually, and unaffected by ulterior divisions and subdivisions, that each of the adjoining proprietors shall make and maintain one-half of the division fence. The division of enclosed lands, by sale or otherwise, prima facie subjects them to a new division of the fence among the new owners. Where the objection to a recovery in such action, was, that it did not appear, that there was no record of a division of the fence; it was held, that the objection was unavailing. If, in this case, the plaintiff’s grantor built the entire fence originally, and the plaintiff and defendant have enjoyed it, for more than fifteen years, this does not shew that the plaintiff is bound, by prescription, to maintain the entire fence in its present condition; for there was nothing of an adverse character in the user, neither party having done any more than he was obliged to do, in order to the full and secure enjoyment of his property. Middlesex, July, 1851. If such user could be considered as evidence of an agreement of the parties to that effect, during its continuance, the evidence might be resisted, by shewing why and how the user took place. The law of this state is different from that of Massachusetts and of England, in this respect; that here, the owner or occupier of the land is obliged to fence it against cattle, at his own risk, and if his land is not fenced, he can neither recover damages, nor impound for a trespass by cattle; whereas in Massachusetts and in England, the owner of the cattle must restrain them, at his own risk, or he will be liable, if they trespass upon the lands of others. Where it appeared, that the sum awarded by the fence-viewers, under the 8th section of the statute, was made up of a certain summer rod of one-half of the fence set to the defendant, and of interest thereon, for a period extending backbeyond the demand for a division of the line; it was held, that the fence-viewers had not exceeded their jurisdiction, nor was their judgment as to the amount, subject to revision by the court. [One judge dissenting, on most of the positions above stated.] This was originally an action brought by Martin Wright against Benjamin Wright, on the statute concerning Fences, &c., to recover the sum of forty dollars, awarded by the fence-viewers, under the 8th section of that statute. The declaration stated, that on the 13th day of July, 1826, Martin Wright, now deceased, owned a certain tract of land, or particular enclosure, situated in Westbrook, bounded Westerly on the highway, and every other way on the land of the defendant, and containing eighteen acres; the division fence betwixt which land of said Martin Wright and of the defendant was equally owned and maintained by them severally, and divided; the entire Southerly and so much of the Easterly line as constituted the one-half part thereof, being owned and maintained by said Martin Wright; that said Martin Wright afterwards, on the same day, sold and conveyed the whole of said tract of land, as follows—four and one-fourth acres, across the Northerly part thereof, to Richard W. Wright, seven and three-fourths acres to D. B. Wright, and the remainder, being five acres and thirty rods of land, the same being bounded Southerly on the defendant’s said land, and Westerly on highway, to the plaintiff; that the defendant ever since has owned, and now does own, said land, so surrounding and adjoining the land or particular enclosure, owned by said Martin Wright, deceased, except the highway as aforesaid, and during all said time, has been, and now is, liable to maintain the one-half of said division fence; that by said sales and conveyances by said Martin Wright, deceased, a division of said division fence betwixt the proprietors of said land and the land of the defendant, became and is necessary; that betwixt said land of the plaintiff, being part of the particular enclosure of said Martin Wright, as aforesaid, and the land of the defendant, adjoining the same Southerly, there has been, during all the time aforesaid, and still is, a division fence, being stone fence, and part of the division fence as aforesaid, which fence runs the whole width of the plaintiff’s land, and is thirty-two and a half rods in length, and is butted Westerly on the highway; that said fence has never, until the time hereinafter mentioned, been divided betwixt the plaintiff and defendant; and that the plaintiff has, at all times, ever since the said 13th day of July, 1826, and now does, own and improve said land so conveyed to him by said Martin Wright, and has, during all said time, until the division hereinafter mentioned, owned and maintained the whole of said fence; that during all the time aforesaid, it was, and now is, the duty of the defendant to purchase of the plaintiff and maintain the one-half part of said division stone fence, the lands of both parties being particular enclosures and improved, and said fence being at all times necessary; but the defendant has, at all times, neglected and refused so to do, though often requested and demanded by the plaintiff; and the plaintiff and defendant not being able to agree respecting a division of said fence, the plaintiff did thereupon call out two of the fence-viewers of said Westbrook, in which town said fence is situated, to wit, William A. Bushnell and Aaron Stevens, who, being under oath, did, on the 24th day of January, 1849, view said line of division fence, and did then and there make a division and apportionment thereof, as follows—to said Benjamin Wright, defendant, they did set, divide and apportion the Easterly half or part of said fence, being stone fence, commencing at the Westerly end, at the South-east corner of the plaintiff’s land, and running thence Westerly, sixteen rods, including the bars, and eight links, to a heap of stones by said fence on the Southerly side thereof, and the remaining or Westerly half or part of said fence, they determined should remain the property of the plaintiff; which said division and apportionment was necessary to do justice to said parties. And said fence-viewers did further, then and there, award, after hearing said parties in the premises, that the defendant should pay therefor to the plaintiff the sum of forty dollars, to be paid at the end of twenty days from that date, the same being just and reasonable; which award was in writing, and signed by said fence-viewers, and was duly recorded in the records of said town of Westbrook, on the 26th day of January, 1849; of all which the defendant had due notice. The defendant pleaded four pleas. The first was, that the cause of action, (viz. the partition of the eighteen acre lot in 1826,) did not accrue within six years before the commencement of the suit. The second plea alleged, that for more than thirty years before the 13th day of July, 1826, said Martin Wright, deceased, and those whose estate he had, and the plaintiff now has, were accustomed to make and maintain said fence, described as about thirty-two and a half rods long, at their own cost and charges, and without expense to the defendant, or those whose estate he has; and the plaintiff, at the time of the pretended division by said fence-viewers, was bound in law to make and maintain the whole of said fence so divided, at his own cost and charge, and the defendant was not liable to make, or maintain, or pay for any part thereof. The third plea averred, that the fence described in the declaration as being about thirty-two and a half rods long, and as having been divided by said fence-viewers, was made by the plaintiff, without the defendant’s knowledge or consent, and against his will, on the land, which, at the time it was so built, and until long after said pretended division by said fence-viewers, was, and continued to be, owned and occupied by the defendant; and said fence was, at the time of such pretended division, owned by the defendant, and so was not subject to such division and award by said fence-viewers, at the request of the plaintiff. The fourth plea averred, that said fence-viewers, in making their said award, made a gross error, miscalculation and mis take, inasmuch as they allowed to the plaintiff, in their award, interest on the value and expense of the one-half of said fence, so divided, for a long time, viz. for more than fourteen years, before said division and award, and long before any claim or demand for a division of said fence was made by the plaintiff of the defendant, or was proved or pretended to have been so made before said fence-viewers. To the first and second of these pleas the plaintiff demurred. To the third plea he replied, that the division fence, described in said plea, was built, by those under whom the plaintiff claims, upon the boundary line, between the lands owned by those under whom the plaintiff claims, and those under whom the defendant claims, and with the knowledge and consent of the defendant, and those under whom he claims; and that it has ever since continued to be, and still is, upon said boundary line; traversing the allegation that said fence was made by the plaintiff, without the defendant’s knowledge and consent, and against his will, on land, which, at the time it was so built, and until long after the division of said fence, by said fence-viewers, was, and continued to be, owned and occupied by the defendant. To the fourth plea, the plaintiff replied, that said fence-viewers, in making their award, did not make any gross error, miscalculation or mistake, either in the manner set forth in the said plea, or in any other respect or particular whatever. On the third and fourth pleas, and the replications thereto, issues were joined to the court. After a full hearing, the court decided, that the first and second pleas were insufficient, and found the issues of fact on the third and fourth pleas in favour of the plaintiff; and thereupon rendered judgment, that the plaintiff recover of the defendant the sum of forty dollars, and his costs of suit. In the course of the trial, the defendant, in support of the fourth plea, offered in evidence the testimony of Aaron Stevens, one of the fence-viewers mentioned in the plaintiff’s declaration, that they allowed to the plaintiff, in their award, the sum of one dollar and twenty-five cents per rod, for the sixteen rods and eight links, being one-half of said fence so divided and set to the defendant, as stated in the declaration, and in addition to that sum, allowed to him interest on the same, for a period extending back more than fourteen years before said division and award, and before any claim or demand was made by the plaintiff of the defendant for the division of said line of fence, making together the amount of said award. To the admission of this evidence the plaintiff objected, and the court rejected it. The defendant filed his motion in, error, in pursuance of which the record was transmitted to the superior court; and the questions of law arising thereon were reserved for the advice of this court. Toucey, for the plaintiff in error, remarked in limine, that the whole state was, at first, owned in large tracts, which have since been divided up. The claim of the plaintiff is, that a party may go back 100 or 200 years, and break up all the divisions and arrangements of fences, through all that time, when there is no record, and so continue forever, breaking up as fast as made. He then contended, 1. That the fence-viewers had no jurisdiction in the case. It is averred, that the fence in question had never been divided. If so, the division pertained to the select-men, under the 4th section of the statute. The statute intends to embrace all cases of difficulty. In the first place, by this section, when there is a fence between adjoining proprietors (an outside fence to each,) which has never been divided, the select-men may be called upon. Secondly, when two persons own an enclosed lot in severalty, as if one owns the East half, and the other the West half, and there is no fence between their parts, or when by sale, &c., an enclosed lot is divided between two, and there is no fence between their parts, the fence-viewers may be called upon. See 7th section. Thirdly, when by sale, &c., an enclosed lot is divided between two, and there is a fence belonging to the lot running between their parts, the fence-viewers may be called upon. See section 8. Fourthly, by the same 8th section, when there has been a division between any adjoining proprietors, and there is no record of it, and the parties cannot agree where it is, the fence-viewers may be called out. The second clause of the 8th section has no reference to the first, and is not confined to cases of sale, &c., but is general. The first clause was enacted in 1843, and the second in 1848. Any other construction of the second clause brings it into conflict with the 4th section. When therefore the declaration says, there never was any division of the fence, the case is brought under the 4th section. The first clause of the 8th section applies to an inside fence, belonging to the lots. If it applied to an outside fence between outside adjoining proprietors, it would come in conflict with the 4th section. The term “particular inclosure,” does not mean necessarily a single lot, but a tract, owned by one man; and it may have fences across it, &c. Vide 14 Conn. R. 298. opinion of Sherman, J. in Studwell v. Ritch. 2. That the rights of the parties are settled by prescription. First, in 1826, at the time of the sale, there had been a division of the fence, (which must now be presumed to have been in writing, Curtiss v. Beardslee, 15 Conn. R. 522.) for thirty years, and the rights were fixed and could not be altered. Secondly, if they could then have been altered, on account of the sale at that time, the right was lost, by the long interval between 1826 and 1849, twenty-three years. Prescription is equivalent to a record title, and where the statute says “when there is no record of any division,” it means no record or prescription, which is the same thing. Prescription, as a title, is never mentioned in any statute. There is the same necessity for prescription to settle titles to fence, as to all other rights. If, when there has been a division acted upon for fifty years, and expensive arrangements made in reference to it, of fences, walls, offsets, buildings, &c., the whole can be broken up, by the sale of one party, the mischief would be incalculable. No man could make himself safe, by any precaution. 3. That the principle of estoppel applies to this case. See Noyes v. Ward, 19 Conn. R. 250. 1 Greenl. Ev. and the cases there cited. 4. That prior to the statutes of 1843 and 1848, (sec. 8, of the new edition,) the rights of the parties had become settled, and they could not be altered or diverted by that section. 5. That the declaration is palpably insufficient. The pleas are sufficient, and judgment should have been for the defendant below, upon the demurrer. 6. That the evidence of gross mistake or misconduct should have been allowed, to prove the affirmative of the issue. It was proof of a clear excess of jurisdiction, by gross mistake or misconduct. Spencer, for the defendant in error, contended, 1. That the plea of the statute of limitations is bad, because it appears from the pleadings, that the action was brought on the 20th of March, 1849, and the cause of action, which is the award of the fence-viewers, arose in twenty days after the 24th of January, 1849, the date of the award. 2. That the testimony of Aaron Stevens to prove the misconduct of the fence-viewers, was properly rejected; because, first, it did not tend to prove any misconduct or error. The fence-viewers had a right to consider the loss of interest, if, in their opinion, necessary to do justice between the parties. Secondly, the proceedings of the fence-viewers were not subject to the revision of the county court. They are an independent tribunal; and the county court has, in relation to them, no appellate jurisdiction. If their award could be set aside for error in the rule or principle adopted by them, it can only be by a court of equity upon petition brought for that purpose, analogous to the law respecting the setting-aside of the awards of arbitrators. Brown v. Green, 7 Conn. R. 536. 542. Newland v. Douglass, 2 Johns. R. 62, 3, Barlow v. Todd, 3 Johns. R. 367. 369. Thirdly, one of the fence-viewers themselves was not a proper witness to invalidate their award, by showing misconduct. They ought to be excluded on the same ground that jurors are not permitted to expose the proceedings of the jury-room; or that officers are not permitted to invalidate their own returns; or that arbitrators may not show their own mistakes. 3. That the inability to agree upon a division of the fence, is sufficiently stated; the declaration following the language of the statute. 4. That the plaintiff had a right to a division of the fence between him and the defendant, in July, 1826, immediately after the subdivision of the eighteen acre lot, notwithstanding the previous division of the fence between Martin Wright, sen., and the defendant. First, he had this right under the first clause of sect. 8. of the statute relating to Fences; because here was, 1st, a particular enclosure, divided by sale. 2dly, the parties in interest were not able to agree, respecting the division of a fence belonging to the enclosure. By “parties in interest\" are meant all those owning the adjoining lands, between which the fence stands; and by “a fence belonging to the enclosure,\" is meant, not an internal fence merely, or one entirely within the enclosure, but any fence necessary to its security and protection. 3dly, this construction is sustained by the reason and probabilities of the case. It would be contrary to the general policy of our law respecting fences, and to common sense and reason, that there should be any other than an equal and uniform rule respecting the obligation to fence. If the contrary construction were adopted, it would often happen, that upon the subdivision of a lot, one of the parties among whom it was subdivided, would have the whole fence to make, and another no fence at all; and this duty and exemption would extend to all their respective heirs and assigns. The obligation to fence should follow the title to the land, and should be uniform and equal. Any inconvenience which might be supposed to arise from the new division of the fence, upon the subdivision of an adjoining enclosure, is corrected by the ample power of the fence-viewers as to apportionment and compensation. Secondly, the plaintiff has this right under the second clause of section 8, because, first, the adjoining proprietors cannot agree as to the division of the fence. Secondly, there is no record of any such division. There is no ground for the objection made to the declaration, on the ground that it does not allege that there is no record of a division. It expressly alleges, that there has been no division, and of course, it was unnecessary, and would have been superfluous to aver that there was no record of such division. Thirdly, if the plaintiff had a remedy, it was not necessary for him to pursue it under sect. 4. of the statute. The second clause of sect. 8. is supplementary to sect. 4. and is adapted to cases where, as in this instance, sect. 4. is totally inadequate, inasmuch as sect. 4. provides only for cases where there is a wilful refusal to divide the fence; and it provides only for a division of the fence, without any award of compensation for that part of it which is set to the other party; which would be unjust, in a great variety of cases. 5. That if, in July, 1826, the plaintiff had a right to this remedy, he has not lost it, by lapse of time since that period. Of course, it is immaterial whether the old division of the fence, before the subdivision of the eighteen acre lot, was by assignment, or by agreement, or by prescription. A new state of things arose upon that subdivision, and the only prescription which could fix the obligation to maintain the whole fence, upon the plaintiff, is one which has arisen since 1826, i. e. within a period of less than twenty-three years before the award of the fence-viewers. In this case, there is no duty on the part of the plaintiff to maintain the division fence between him and the defendant, arising out of prescription; because first, the duty to make and maintain a division fence is thrown equally upon the adjacent owners by statute, and a statutory obligation cannot be waived or dispensed with by prescription. Secondly, whatever may be the common law, or the law in Massachusetts and other states, as to fences by prescription, there is no such law in this state. The fundamental principle governing the subject of fences here, is different. At common law and in Massachusetts, no person is bound to fence his enclosure, unless by statutory assignment, by agreement, or by prescription; and he may maintain trespass for damage done in his premises, although not fenced, unless he is under one or the other of the above-named obligations to fence. But in this state, a man must fence his enclosure, or take the proper means to have it fenced, before he can maintain trespass for damage done by cattle. There, the owner of cattle is bound to restrain his cattle; here, the owner of land is bound to protect his land. Compare Studwell v, Ritch, 14 Conn. R. 295. with Rust v. Low, 6 Mass. R. 91. and Thayer v. Arnold, 4 Metc. 589. Here, where one must make a fence for the protection of his land, the fact of his having made and maintained one for any length of time, can not raise a presumption of an agreement to do so. Nothing can be inferred but that he did it exclusively for his ownprotection, independently of any obligation towards any other person. And certainly, acts done by one on his own land, for however long a period, which he had a right to do, and which were necessary for his protection, and were done exclusively for his own benefit, can never grow into a right in another party to insist upon the former continuing to do these acts indefinitely, for the benefit of the latter. Thirdly, the time which elapsed between 1826 and 1849, is too short to fix such a prescription. If it exists at all, it must be by virtue of “a usage beyond the time of memory? And the time, of legal memory, which originally dated from the reign of Richard I., is certainly not less than sixty, or at the shortest, forty years. 8 Pick. 511. 10 Pick. 295. Id. 138. This is an entirely different thing from an easement, which may be acquired by fifteen years’ adverse possession; for here there has been no possession by the defendant, adverse or otherwise, and the right he claims to have acquired has no affinity whatever to an easement. 3 Kent’s Com. 434.

In an action on the case to recover damages for the loss of a horse which had strayed from the pasture through a decayed and broken down fence, and fallen into a stone quarry, the court refused to charge the jury, as requested, that if the plaintiff knew that the quarry of the defendants was open and exposed on the side adjoining the property occupied by him, and with such knowledge he put or permitted his horse to pasture in the adjoining field, and while so pasturing the horse strayed on the property of the defendants and was killed by accidentally falling into\\'a stone quarry, the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence, and could not recover. Held to be error, for the gist of the action was the negligence, and not the breach of the contract to keep the fence in repair, and therefore any contributory negligence on part of the plaintiff would defeat his recovery. February 16th, 1887. Before Mercur, C. J., Gordon, Paxson, Trunkey, Sterrett, Green and Clark, JJ. Error to the Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh county: Of July Term, 1886, No. 92. Case by Thomas Anthony against Nelson Krum and Franklin Peters to recover damages for the loss of a horse, occasioned by the alleged negligence of the defendants in not making and keeping in repair a fence between tire lands of the plaintiff and the defendants, through which neglect the plaintiff’s horse had strayed into the defendants’ field and fallen into a stone quarry and was killed. Plea, not guilty. The following are the facts of the case as they appeared on the trial: About twenty years before the accident, Nathan Kern and Harry Williams were the owners of two adjoining farms in Lehigh county. They agreed in parol that a certain fence then existing between parts of the two tracts should be kept up by Williams at the lower end, and by Kern at the upper end. The fence was made by Nathan Kern forty years before, when his father was the owner of the Williams tract. Shortly after the agreement between Kern and Williams the former sold his tract, and at the time of the injury complained of it was in the possession of Anthony, the plaintiff. Williams died several years before the accident and a part of his tract was leased by his heirs to the defendants for the purpose of working a slate quarry on .the property. As this quarry was worked it extended farther and farther towards the plaintiff’s line until it reached within six or eight feet of it. The fence between the two tracts was a worm fence, and gradually became worn out — part of it was removed, but not by the defendants — and part of it, extending along the edge of the quarry was down and had been for a long time previous to the accident. The plaintiff admitted at the trial that he knew the fence was down and had been for a long time — that he saw it every day — that it was down the whole length of the quarry —and that he was fully acquainted with its condition. He put a horse to pasture at night-time in the field adjoining the quarry. There were two open quarries in this field on the plaintiff’s tract that were unfenced and no fence between that held and the defendant’s quarry. During the night this horse, while pasturing in this unfenced field, strayed on the premises of the defendants and fell into the quarry and was killed. It was contended by the defendants that they were not obliged to fence in their quarry or to keep up the fence already there, and that they were not bound by the parol personal contract between Kern and Williams; and that if they were bound by this understanding they were not liable in this action, because the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence. The defendant presented, inter alia, the following points for charge: If the jury believe that the plaintiff knew that the quarry of the defendants was open and exposed on the side adjoining the property occupied by him, that there was no guard or fence between the said properties, that the quarry was a deep one, and with such knowledge he put or permitted his horse to pasture in the adjoining field, and while so pasturing he strayed on the property of the defendants, and was killed by accidentally falling into said quarry, then the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence and he cannot recover in this case. Answer. “Negatived.” (Third assignment of error.) If the plaintiff knew that the fence was no longer there, or was bad, and he put his horse in the field, and the horse strayed over and fell into the pit, he would be guilty of contributory negligence and could not recover. Answer. I cannot so instruct you. According to my view of the law, if the defendants were bound to keep up the fence and did not keep it up, I say to you if the defendants are found by you to have been liable to make that fence, and they failed to make it, and the plaintiff put his horse into the field, and the horse came over through that fence or where it should have been, the defendants may be held liable. (Fourth assignment of error.) In the general charge the court instructed the jury, inter alia, as follows: If it is found that it was the duty of Krum & Peters to make the fence, and that they neglected and refused to make it, and that owing to that neglect the horse was lost, then the defendants are liable. • If the plaintiff has convinced you that such was the understanding and contract between the owners of the land .at one time, and that that was never changed, then the duty fell upon the owners of the Harry Williams tract to maintain the fence at the northern end. If the owners of the Harry Williams tract were\\' bound to make the northern half of the fence, then Krum & Peters, who were the lessees of the Harry Williams heirs, were bound to maintain that part of the fence adjoining the quarry, separating it from the field of Mr. Anthony on the east.

As there was no legal duty devolving upon the defendants to fence their quarry there can be no legal liability arising from a right to fence it.- At common law the owner of land was not bound to fence out cattle, and if they strayed upon unenclosed land it was at their risk: Wharton on Negligence, p. 883.‘ The same view is taken in Railroad Co. v. Rushman, 49 Pa. St., 101, and Railroad Co. v. Skinner, 19 Id., 298. Every man is bound to keep his cattle on his own land at his peril: Aury v. Maxwell, 4 N H., 36 ; Mills v. Stark, 4 Id., 514; Towns v. Railroad Co., 1 Foster, 363. \\' For years this fence was down. No one repaired it. Upon the two tracts there were opened quarries, and the land was ■hilly, and whatever duty was assumed by Williams and Kern was waived long ago. Surely the parties might waive a com\"mon duty: Milligan v. Wehinger, 68 Pa. St., 235. James S.

Shriver, 1 Casey, 78. \\' The proportion in which partition fences are to be kept up is clearly defined bv the third section of the Act of 11th March 1842, (P. L., 62). The occupier of the dominant tenement is entitled to the benefit of his field for turning in’Other people’s cattle as well as his own stock; and if he takes in another man’s horse, and the horse gets through a ruinous fence, which the adjoining occupier ought to have repaired, and falls into-a pit on the adjoining land and is killed, the occupier who ought to have repaired’ the fence is, as we have seen, responsible for the full value of the horse to the occupier of the field from which the horse strayed : 1 Add. on Torts, Wood’s Ed., p. 268, pi. 243; Rooth v. Wilson, 1 B. & Aid., 59.

Olcott, 13 N. H., 399. Where there is only a line between the lands of the parties, each has a right to insist upon a common partition fence along it: Rangier v. MeCreight, 3 Casey, 97. Under the Act of 11th March, 1842, relative to fences, the expense of a partition fence on adjoining improved lands belonging to two persons is to be borne by them equally : Rohrer v. Rohrer, 6 Harris, 367. . Keeping up the partition fence between adjoining landowners is a common duty: Milligan v. Wehinger, 18-P. F. S., 235. Owners of adjoining lands with a division fence between them, built one half by each, and established for more than twenty-one years, have not such an ownership in the materials of which it is made as will justify a removal by either of the portion built by him, against the consent of the other; and for such removal an action of trespass will lie: Stoner v.

A license is technically an authority given to do some one act, or a series of acts, on the land of another, without passing any estate in the land: such as a license to hunt on another’s land, or to cut down a certain number of trees. These are held to he revocable, when executory, unless a definite term is fixed; but irrevocable, when executed. But licenses, which in their nature amount to the granting of an estate, for ever so short a time, are not good without deed; and are considered as leases, and must always he pleaded as such. licenses to do a particular act, do not, in any degree trench upon the policy of the law which requires that bargains respecting the title or interest in real estate, shall be by deed or iq writing. They amount to nothing more than an excuse for the act, which would otherwise be a trespass. But a permanent right to hold another’s land for a particular purpose, and to enter upon it at all times without his consent, is an important interest, which ought not to pass without writing, and is the very object provided for by the statute of frauds. It is a rule to which the courts have constantly adhered, that an actual location of a division line, between the adjoining lands of different proprietors, however erroneous, shall control the courses and distances in the title deeds, when acquiesced in for a length of time sufficient to bar an entry. Agreements made in respect to disputed boundary lines, are not within the statute of frauds, because they can not be considered as extending to the title; nor do they have the operation of a conveyance, so as to pass the title from one to another. Such agreements proceed upon the fact that the true line of separation is not only fairly and truly in dispute, but that it is also, to some extent, undefined and unknown. To bring an agreement in respect to lands within the operation of the statute of frauds, it must in effect create, grant, assign, surrender or declare some interest or estate in lands, other than a lease for the term of one year; and whenever it is designed to have this effect, it must be in writing, and be subscribed by the party granting or creating such estate or interest; or it is absolutely void. The law, for wise and just purposes, prescribes certain forms and solemnities to be observed in passing an interest or estate in lands; and pays no regard whatever to the motives of those who may become parties to the conveyance, nor to the extent of territory to be affected thereby. These forms and solemnities must be observed, or the legal estate will remain precisely as if nothing had been done. Equity will enforce the performance of a parol agreement for the sale of lands, against a vendee who has been put into possession, or against a vendor who has been paid the purchase money. And, it seems, that the supreme court, in the exercise of its equitable power, might enforce and maintain a parol contract to straighten a crooked boundary line, by an exchange of the lands necessary to effect that object, where the parties mutually obtained an equivalent for the lands surrendered, and the contract had been executed by the delivery of the possession. McCoun, J. dissented. The owner of land, who has claimed, occupied and cultivated it up to a crooked boundary line, for a length of time sufficient to bar an entry, can not be divested of his title and estate in any portion of that land, by any parol admissions that such line is erroneous; nor, by any parol agreement to straighten it. And any such parol agreement, made with the owner of the adjacent land, to straighten the line by the removal of the old crooked fence therefrom, and the erection of a new and straight fence in its stead, maybe revoked at any time before such new fence shall he completed; and if such adjacent owner persist in erecting such new fence, after having notice to desist, he will be liable to an action of trespass; and can not sustain a plea of liberum tenementum, by any parol admissions, or other parol evidence that the true boundary line was always understood to be a straight one. McCoun, J. dissented. This was an appeal to the general term of the court, by the plaintiff Joel Davis, from a judgment entered on the 29th day of May, 1850, in favor of the defendant, Isaac IT. Townsend, on a verdict rendered at the circuit. The complaint alledged that the defendant broke and entered a certain close of the plaintiff’s, situate in the town of Worth Hempstead, in &c., and with his servants then and there trod down the grass, &e.; f‘ and also then and there pulled and took down a fence standing upon said close, and removed the same, and also then and there erected another fence upon the said close ; and also then and there disturbed the said plaintiff in the use and occupation of the said close, and hindered and prevented him from enjoying the same as he otherwise would have done,” <fcc. The defendant, in Ms answer, denied that he was guilty of the several acts alledged, <fcc. and “ all and each of the allegations in said complaint contained.” He also denied that the close or piece of land in the complaint mentioned was the close, soil, or freehold of the plaintiff ; but on the contrary, he averred, that the said close or piece of land was at the time in said complaint mentioned, and is, the close, soil and freehold of the defendant. And he further alledged that the fence mentioned in the complaint was a division fence between land of the plaintiff and of the defendant, one half of which the defendant was bound to make and keep in repair, and that he “ did take up and remove the part of said fence which he was bound to keep in repair, and replaced the same with a new fence upon said division line, as he had full right to do.” The plaintiff, in his reply, averred that the defendant was guilty of the several acts <fcc., and that the close “ was and still is the close, soil and freehold of him the said plaintiff, and was not at the time in the said complaint mentioned, nor is it the close, soil and freehold of him the said defendant, as alledged or pretended in said answer.” And “ that the said new fence mentioned in said answer was not erected or placed by the said defendant upon the true division line between the said defendant and said plaintiff ; nor upon the line of the old fence, but upon the close, soil and freehold of him the said plaintiff, without any right or authority in him the said defendant so to do.” And he denied the right of the defendant to take up and remove the said fence, and erect and place the new fence, as claimed and alledged in the answer. The cause was tried at the circuit in Queens county, on the 21st of March, 1850, before Justice McOoun and a jury. The plaintiff proved that his farm was separated from that of the defendant by a line fence; that he had occupied his farm for 20 or 30, and according to one witness 38 years.; and for the whole period of 20 to 30 years had claimed and used all the land close up to said division fence, for farming purposes. It was here admitted that the parties were the owners of adjoining farms, and that the fence in question was the division or line fence between them. And from the evidence it appeared that the plaintiff’s farm was on the north, and the defendant’s on the south side of the division line; that the old fence was not straight, and that the new one was on a straight line; that the defendant kept up and maintained the east part of the original division fence, and the plaintiff the west part; that the part of the fence the defendant removed was about the centre of the part he was bound to keep up and repair ; that the plaintiff had built about half of the old division fence, and that half was a straight post and rail fence, and\\' that the defendant’s half was an old worm fence. One of the plaintiff’s witnesses testified that when the defendant was building his new fence, the plaintiff being disabled arid confined to the. house, sent him, the witness, to see how and where the defendant was putting up this new fence; that he (the witness) told the defendant, then, that he was over the old line and upon the plaintiff’s land some eighteen inches ; that the defendant replied, that when he found he was wrong he would remove the fence; this was in May, 1849; and that since the erection of the new fence the plaintiff had been deprived of the use of the farm where the old fence stood. Another of the plaintiff’s witnesses (\"William Skidmore) proved, that his (witness’) father and the plaintiff bought the farms together, it was originally one farm; and his father occupied the defendant’s farm for twelve years subsequent to the year 1811; that the two farms were divided by a division fence, and the easterly part, which the defendant kept up, was a worm fence; that his father and his workmen put up the original fence; the true line between the parties was always considered a straight line from the east to the west end. The same witness also testified that about six years before, he was called by the plaintiff to look at this fence; that Warren Mitchell was with him; that the plaintiff said that the defendant had begun to make a new fence, and as he thought, had encroached on his land; about 20 or 30 lengths were put up at that time; that Mitchell and himself were requested by the parties, who were both present and agreed upon the starting point, to fix upon the line of that fence; the defendant agreed to alter the east post and some few lengths of the fence; he was to move the east post on his own land some 12 to 18 inches ; that he was to remove all that the plaintiff thought stood on his land; the true line was understood to be a straight line by all, and witness and Mitchell set the stakes in a straight line, without regard to the curve of the worm fence; the worm fence was not a straight line exactly: that they then set up stakes on nearly two-thirds of the defendant’s fence; the plaintiff made no objection to the straight line; that witness saw the plaintiff in May or June, 1849, when he again complained of the defendant’s putting up a fence on his land; the plaintiff did not complain of the adjustment made by witness and Mitchell, but said the defendant was building his fence on him ; the fence, at the time last spoken of, was not built as far as they had previously set the stakes, but the fence, as far as built, was on an exact line with the other fence previously built by compass : the old fence curved somewhat, but the new fence was on a straight line the whole length from the east end to the western-terminus on the meadows; the line of fence strikes on the plaintiff’s side; the defendant authorized the witness to propose to the plaintiff to leave the matter to arbitrators to determine the true line; but the plaintiff would not arbitrate, unless the defendant would put up this fence on the centre of the old one. It was always understood in the time of witness’ father, that the division line between the farms was a straight line. Warren Mitchell, being called as a witness by the defendant, corroborated entirely the statement of the last witness as to being employed by the parties, six or seven years before, to arrange the line of the division fence in their presence, and the agreement of the parties as to the running of the line, &c. Several other witnesses testified to the like effect in relation to the fences, and the agreement of the plaintiff that the fence should be made on a line that should be straight. The defendant also proved by the three persons who worked for him in erecting the new fence, that it was built on the line where the stakes were set, as described by the witnesses who set them; and that they took up the stakes as fast as they built the fence. After the plaintiff had rested, the defendant, by his counsel, before entering on his defense, moved for a nonsuit, on the ground that the plaintiff\\'having declared for trespasses generally, without naming the close, and the defendant having pleaded that the locus in quo was his own soil or freehold, and it clearly appearing that the defendant, at the time, had land in the same town, he was\\' entitled of course to a verdict; which motion was overruled, and the defendant excepted. The. counsel .for the plaintiff also objected, in due season, to the offering of any evidence by the defendant, tending to show that a new division fence had been agreed upon, verbally, between the parties; and exceptions were taken in due time, on behalf of the plaintiff, to the admission of all such evidence. The judge charged the jury, to the effect, that this was not a controversy about the title, but about the division fence ; that the whole premises was originally one farm, and was divided about the year 1811, and the parties claimed title from the same source: that the line was originally intended to be straight, and the deeds called for a straight line; that the fence was built probably about 1811, the plaintiff’s fence being a post and rail, and the defendant’s a worm fence; that some six or seven years ago the defendant desired to substitute a post and rail for the old worm fence, and commenced building it, and it clearly appeared that the new fence did run on a line north of the centre of the old worm fence; that an old fence becomes a landmark, and would, if parties acquiesce for a length of time, determine the line, even though it should not accord with the true line; but if the owners desire to change the line by making it straight when it was crooked, they could do so without a deed in writing; that the title would not pass by a verbal agreement, but if the parties verbally agreed to straighten the line, the party who acted upon such agreement would not be liable to the other in an action of this kind; in such a case his entry upon the land would not be unauthorized. That the statute of frauds did not apply to this case. Here it appeared that when the defendant commenced rebuilding his fence, some six or seven years ago, he misplaced it, the plaintiff complained, and the parties called in two of their neighbors, Mitchell and Skidmore, to run the line for them; the plaintiff and the defendant agreed upon the point of beginning and the course, and Mitchell and Skidmore ran the course and set stakes upon the line; the defendant removed what he had already built upon this line, and made a portion of his fence; that for some cause he did not finish it; but last spring (1849) he continued the fence; a complaint was again made and the same neighbors were again called in; the plaintiff did not find any fault with what had been formerly done, but seemed to complain, according to Skidmore’s statement, that the fence was not on the line as adjusted by them. That if the jury believed, from the evidence, that Davis, (the plaintiff,) at that time, acquiesced in the line as run out by Mitchell and Skid-more, and that the defendant had set his fence upon that line it would be sufficient; that the whole question was one of fact for the jury, and might be stated thus : “ Did the defendant put his fence upon the line as marked out by Skidmore and Mitchell, and was that done with the consent of the plaintiff?” The plaintiff’s counsel excepted to all that part of the charge declaring that the title did not come in question; and that a verbal agree xnent to change the boundary line was sufficient. The jury found a verdict for the defendant. T. C. Pinckney, for the appellant, submitted the following points and authorities. I. That the possession of the premises by the appellant, for the length of time stated in the case, gave him a complete title up to the old division fence, whether that fence was crooked or straight, or upon the true line or not. (Adams on Eject. 77, and notes. 3 John. 8, 269. 9 Id. 61. 1 Cowen, 613. 4 Wend. 313. 6 Id. 469. 3 Har. & J. 329.) II. That parol evidence of a verbal agreement as to a new division or boundary line was within the statute of frauds, and inadmissible; and that the objections and exceptions upon the trial on the part of the appellant in that respect were well taken. (5 John. 272. 7 Id. 205. 9 Id. 61. 15 Wend. 380, 588.) III. That within the statute of frauds no interest in lands can pass, except by deed, or conveyance, or instrument in writing, subscribed\\'by the party, or his agent. (2 R. S. 194, § 6, last ed. 4 John. 81. 7 Id. 205. 15 Wend. 380, 588. 2 Caines, 198. 9 John. 61.) IV. That his honor the presiding judge erred in charging that the title to lands did not come in question. (Cowen’s Tr. pt. 1, p. 33 to 35, 2d ed. 1 John. 146. 2 Id. 185. Code of Proc. § 304, sub. 1.) Y. That the judge also erred in charging that a verbal agreement to change the boundary line was sufficient. (4 John. 81. 5 Id. 272. 7 Id. 205. 9 Id. 61. 15 Wend. 380, 588.) YI. That the respondent had no right to enter the premises in question, and take down and remove the old . fence, and erect another, in the manner stated in the case, and that the verdict and judgment herein were against law and evidence, and ought to be set aside and a new trial granted. (6 John. 5. 14 Id. 406. 19 Id. 385.) W. S. Smith, for the respondent, submitted the following points and authorities. I. The agreement proved was not an agreement ■“ to change the boundary line,” but it was an agreement merely to settle or locate the line—the point of beginning having been agreed on by the parties. (Jackson v. Dysling, 2 Caines, 198. Jackson v. Gager, 5 Cowen, 383, and cases cited, post.) II. The calling in of Mitchell and Skidmore was a submission to locate the line; and their acts were acquiesced in by the appellant as right, and were acknowledged by him to be correct. (Same cases. Sellick v. Adams, 15 John. 197, and note. Robertson v. McNiel, 12 Wend. 578 1 Greenl. Ev. 103, § 88.) III. The statute of frauds does not apply. Title was admitted on both sides ; it was a mere agreement to settle the dividing line between them; it was not a contract for the sale and conveyance of lands, and had no ingredient of such a contract. (Boyd v. Graves, 4 Wheat. 513. Jackson v. Gager, 5 Cowen, 383. Robertson v. McNeil, 12 Wend. 578.) IV. But should it be considered that the agreement was void within the statute of frauds, then we say that the trespass complained of was committed with the full permission of the plaintiff, and this license is a complete justification. (Sellick v. Adams, 15 John. 197. Miller v. The Auburn and Syracuse Railroad Co. 6 Hill, 61.) V. Besides, the plaintiff, by his own acts, is estopped from setting up the statute of frauds, or lapse of time, against the defendant. (Cox v. Jagger, 2 Cowen, 638. As to the general doctrine of estoppel inpais, see 3 Hill, 215; 6 Id. 531.) YI. The defendant was entitled to a verdict, under the pleadings and evidence, in any event, for the reason that the complaint stated the trespasses generally without naming the particular close; the defendant answered it was his own soil and freehold, upon which the plaintiff took issue, and it clearly appeared that the defendant did own land in the same town. (1 Chit. Pl. 4th Am. ed. 663. 2 Phil. Ev. 138, ch. 12, § 1. Ellice v. Boyer, 8 Wend. 503. Rich v. Rich, 16 Id. 663, 669.) VII. There was no error committed by the judge on the trial. The judgment is correct, and should be affirmed with interest and costs.',\n",

ERROR to the Common Pleas of Berks county. This was an action of trespass, quare clausum fregit, by Jonas Berk v. J. & L. Dietrich, for removing a gate erected on the land of their father, George Dietrich. Berk had a right of way for 25 or 30 years over the land of George Dietrich to a public highway. About 12 or 14 years before the trial, the plaintiff and one McGargy, the then owner of the land, afterwards owned by Dietrich, fenced a lane, each one putting up a part of the fence, and each keeping the half of it in repair. The lane was not upon the line between them. Subsequently Dietrich determined to fence off a lane by running a fence entirely on his own premises, and affording to Berk an open way, by removing the bars at the road, and also at the other extremity. Berk afterwards entered on Dietrich’s land, and supplied the place of the bars at the road by erecting a gate entirely on Dietrich’s land, thus closing the road, and thus serving to keep bis cattle confined. This gate Dietrich directed to be removed, and this action was brought. The Court below charged that the plaintiff’s right to have the fence closed did not depend on the ground of an easement, or adverse user, or claim of ownership up to the fence, but upon his having built a portion of the fence in consideration of McGargy building another portion of it. That it was a contract, and that the defendants had no right to disturb the fence. Error was assigned to this part of the charge. Jones and Wanner, for plaintiffs in error.

The paramount owner of land having a present right of immediate possession may enter the same though occupied by another, and by himself or his servants remove a fence wrongfully erected thereon; and the persons who remove the same will not be guilty of riot unless they act in a violent and tumultuous manner against the person or property of the trespasser. [Opinion filed September 21, 1888.] Appeal from the County Court of Greene County ; the Hon. L. Larkin, Judge, presiding. In this case the appellants, William Riley and Timothy Sullivan, with others, were indicted by the grand jury for riot at the September term, 1887, of the Greene County Circuit Court, and on certificate, a trial was had at the December term, 1887, of the County Court, resulting in the conviction of the defendants, William Riley and Timothy Sullivan, on the first count in the indictment, and fines of $50 imposed upon each of them, from which judgment they prosecute appeal to this court. The other defendants were discharged. The first count in the indictment charges that on the 23d day of April, 1887, the said Riley and others unlawfully, with force and violence, did break and deface a certain fence, etc., the property of Conner Carmody, against the wish and will of Conner Carmody, etc. The second count charged that the fence was broken unlawfully and in a riotous and tumultuous manner, etc. As the conviction is upon the first count, the main question in this case is, Was the act of William Riley and Timothy Sullivan an unlawful act, done with the force and violence contemplated in the statute defining a riot? A brief statement of the principal facts in the order of their occurrence will show, we think, that the acts of the accused were not only lawful but entirely proper under all the circumstances. In 1857 William E. Davis conveyed to the Jacksonville and Carrollton Eailroad Co. a piece of land 1,221 feet long by 250 feet in width, at Carrollton, Illinois, for depot and right-of-way purposes, lying near the center of section 23; 125 feet of the strip being in the N. E. J and 125 feet in the E. W. I of section 23, the center line of the section north and south being the center line through the strip north and south, along which the main track of the railroad was laid over twenty 3rears ago. William E. Davis then owned a small farm lying on the east of the depot grounds, and prior to 1866 he constructed a rail fence on the line between his farm and the depot grounds. Davis repaired the fence on same line, and after his death Conner Carmody came into possession of the farm and also 'repaired the same fence, and for over twenty years the “Davis fence,” so-called, has been the line dividing the farm now owned by Carmody from the depot grounds. Daring all this time these grounds have been tinder the control of the railroad company, and have been leased by the company at various times for lumber yards, tile factory, etc., and in 18— the C. & A. Eailroad Company leased all the east half of the grounds to L. S. Bushnell, who had the actual possession of the same as such tenant in March and April, 1887, at the time of the occurrences hereafter mentioned. On the lower part of this strip was a tile factory building, and grounds inclosed on the east by the old “ Davis fence,” and on the west by a fence put up by the tile factory company, and in this inclosure a spur from the railroad track was run, and Bushnell had cordwood and other property therein. In March, 1887, Conner Carmody had White, County Surveyor, make a survey, and by virtue of this survey he made claim to a portion of Bushnell’s inclosure, and against the objections and protest of Bushnell, commenced to take it within his pasture, and in doing so tore down andhauled away the lower end of the old Davis fence, and entered upon the railroad grounds leased to Bushnell, and then put up a slat and wire fence, taking into his pasture a strip twelve to fifteen feet in width, and moved Bushnell’s cordwood to make way for his fence. Carmody had full notice that this ground was claimed by the railroad company and he was forbidden by Bushnell, lessee, and by the officers of the company from trespassing upon it. In defiance of all this he forcibly entered and put up. the fence which he claims was unlawfully broken on the 23d day of April, 1887. William Biley, general roadmaster of the C. & A. B. B. Co., acting under the orders of C. H. Chappell, general manager of said company, with other employes under him, came to Carrollton with lumber and material to build a fence upon the line of the old Davis fence, and in a peaceful manner cut Carmody’s wire fence in sections, moved all the material of it into Carniody’s pasture and were proceeding to put up a fence on the old line where the Davis fence had stood, when he and his workmen were arrested on complaint of Carmody. There was no riotous or tumultuous conduct, and no violence was used toward Carmody. The obstruction placed by Carmody was simply removed in a peaceable manner. Mr. Henry C. Withers, for appellants. The C. & A. R. R. Co. and its tenant, Bushnell, had the lawful right to regain possession in a peaceable manner, and this is all that was done by Biley and his workmen. Ill. & St. L. R.

The People, 4 Scam. 179; Legg v. The People, 92 Ill. 598. The County Court erred in allowing evidence in regard to the survey of J. C. White. The railroad company and its predecessors had held continuous and peaceable possession of the ground.on which Car mody put his fence for over twenty years, and the survey of J. C. White, in March, 1887, could not change the boundary lines so long established. Besides this, the White survey is shown by his testimony to be uncertain and unreliable. Title of lands can not be determined by criminal prosecution. The admission of this testimony prejudiced the jury and misled them as to the issue. The plat made by J. C. White for Conner Carmody was not a “ record of survey ” and should have been excluded. This survey was made twenty years after Davis had built his rail fence on the line and it is clear that it was improperly admitted in evidence in this case. Kyle v. Town of Logan, 87 Ill. 66.

Adverse possession — mistake as to boundary. — When a land owner, through mistake as to his boundary line, takes possession of land of an adjacent owner intending to cjaim only to the true boundary, such possession is not adverse, and, though continued for the statutory period, does not divest title; but when he takes possession under the belief that he owns it, incloses and holds it continuously for the statutory period under claim of ownership without any recognition of another’s right thereto, his possession is adverse, and, if continued for the statutory period, will divest the title of the former owner.

Appeal from Boone Chancery Court; T. Haden Humphreys, Chancellor; affirmed. STATEMENT BY THE COURT. George W. O’Neal instituted an action of ejectment in the Boone Circuit Court against John C. Ross. The complaint alleges that he is the owner of lot 12 and the east half of lot 13 in block 10 in the town of Harrison, as originally platted, and that the defendant, Ross, is in the unlawful possession of a strip of land on the north side thereof five feet three inches wide at the east end, and four feet wide at the west end. The defendant, Ross, answered and denied that plaintiff had title to said strip of land, and says that he is entitled to it, and has held possession thereof for the statutory period of seven years. By consent of the parties, the case was transferred to the chancery court. The plaintiff deraigns title by mesne conveyances from the United States Government, and the description contained in the deeds is lot 12 and east half of lot 13 in block 10 in the town of Harrison, as originally platted. His lots front south, and according to the plat extend north one hundred and twenty feet. The defendant is the owner of lots 6 and 8 in said block 10, and his lots run east and west, lot 8 being immediately north of plaintiff’s lots. For some time prior to 1896, Robert Rush owned the lots now owned by the plaintiff, and Arch Stockton was the owner of lots 6 and 8, and resided on them. A wire fence was at that time built on what was supposed to be the boundary line, and Rush testified that neither he nor Stockton intended to claim beyond the true boundary line. On the 3d of April, 1896, Rush conveyed lot 12 and the east half-of lot 13 to Arch Stockton, and on the 26th day of November, 1900, Stockton conveyed the lots to the grantors of the plaintiff. The deed to the plaintiff was made on the 7th of October, 1907. . Afterwards he caused two surveys of his lots to be made, one by Hamilton in March or April, 1908, and the other by Tom Jones in January, 1910. Both these surveys fixed the boundary line so.as to include the strip of land for. which this suit is brought. Dr. Kirby owns a lot on block 2 just east of said block 10, and has erected a stone house thereon. The testimony on the part of the plaintiff shows that while the survey was being made, the defendant contended that a line extending due east from the north wall of Dr. Kirby’s building would be the true boundary line between him and the plaintiff. The testimony of the plaintiff also shows that such extended line would be the line fixed by the surveyors, Hamilton and Jones. The plaintiff also introduced the deposition of W. P. Conley. He testified that on the 30th of September, 1901, he conveyed lots 6 and 8 in said block 10 to thé defendant, Ross. In answer to interrogatory 5, “ State whether or not at any time while you owned said lots 6 and 8 in said block 10 you ever claimed title to any land except that called for by your deed, and by the deed you and your wife made to said Ross, ” he said: “No, unless the fence was over the line. ” He further\\'stated that he does not remember that he ever represented to said Ross that he ever claimed any land except that called for in his deed, and does not remember that the fence was ever mentioned. On cross examination, he stated that at the time he bought the lots, and at the time he sold them to Ross, he regarded the fence on the south as being oh the line. Mrs. Mattie A. Stockton for the defendant testified: “I am the widow of Arch Stockton. He did not own lot 12 and the east half of lot 13 at the same time he owned lots 6 and 8. There was a fence separating lots 6 and 8 from lot 12 and the east half of lot 13. We considered that we owned and sold what was under fence just as it stood between the lots. When my husband sold lots 12 and the east half of lot 13, he did not intend to convey any land north of the fence. ” . The defendant, John C. Ross, testified: \"Iresided on lots 6 and 8 in block 10, and have resided there since I purchased the property from W. B. Conley on September 30, 1901. The lines were pointed out to me when I purchased, the property. There was a wire fence on the south end of it, and this fence was shown to me to be the boundary line on the south side of the property. The fence was a five-strand barb wire fence, and is in the same place now that it was when I took possession of the property. I took possession of the ground in the inclosure, claiming to be the owner. In May, 1902, I sold the lots to E. D Cramer, and made him a deed to them. In about a year Cramer reconveyed the property to me, and I have been the owner of it ever since. In trading with Cramer, I showed him the fence as the. boundary line. During the year that the title was in Cramer, I still resided on the property, renting it from him. The entire ground I now claim has been in a substantial inclosure since I first purchased it in September, 1901.” On cross examination, he was asked: “Why did you not put it in your deed that you were buying to the fence, and that the fence was the line?” He answered: “I did not consider it necessary. They told me the fence was on the line. ” He stated that he thought the fence was on the true line when he purchased the property, and has ever since claimed to own to the fence. In his cross examination appears the following question and answer: “Q. According to Hamilton’s survey, your fence is on lot 12 and the east half of lot 13, is it not? A. I think so. At the time of Hamilton’s survey, I claimed to the fence, and I intended to claim the land, regardless of the survey, or anything else.” He also said he was present when the Jones survey was made, and that he considered that his survey is not the true line. He denies that at the time of Hamilton’s or Jones’s survey he said he would accept a line continuing east with\" the line of the north wall of the Kirby building. E. D. Cramer, for the defendant, testified: “I purchased lots 6 and 8 in block 10 from the : defendant, Ross, in May, 1902, and in about a year deeded them back to him. Ross continued to occupy the property while I owned it. When I purchased the property, Ross showed me the lines and fences: While he did not tell me that the fences were on the line, I took them to be, and he did show me how much ground there was. I understood that I was purchasing all the land in the enclosure, and during the time I owned it I claimed all the land inside the enclosure. The deed made from Ross to me, and from me back to Ross, described the property conveyed as lots 6 and 8 in block 10 in the original town of Harrison. I do not suppose I expected anything more than the deed called for, but I supposed that the deed called for the land enclosed, and that I was getting it. I claimed all that was inside the fence, and did so because I thought the fence was on the line.” Tom Jones, the surveyor, ran a line east from the north wall of Dr. Kirby’s building, and testified that the fence was about on such extended line. Other evidence introduced by the defendant, tended to show that the first fence built by Stockton and Rush was torn down, and the present fence erected a few feet north of it on the finé where it now is and on a fine established by a surveyor named Brandt. That the present fence was erected several years prior to the time the defendant purchased lots 6 and 8, and has ever, since been recognized as the division fine between lots 6, 8 and lot 12, and the east half of lot 13. The chancellor found in favor of the defendant, and the plaintiff has appealed. J. W. Story, for appellant. A possession which seeks to hold only to the true boundary fine is not adverse. To make such possession adverse, there must be an intention on the part of the holder to claim the land without reservation or saving as to the location of the true fine. 15 Ark. 298; 59 Ark. 628 ; 80 Ark. 444; 15 S.

The burden rested on appellant to show title to the land; otherwise in ejectment he could not recover. If\\'that is shown and appellee is put to the proof, then a review of the evidence makes it clear that his possession of the land has been open, notorious, adverse and continuous to the fine established by the fence for more than the statutory period. 2. The fence is the boundary by consent, by buying and selling With Reference thereto, and long acquiescence. 5 Cyc. 984-; 985 (D.); Id. 540; 75 Ark. 399; 71 Ark. 248; 23 Ark. 705; .-99 Ark. 128; 24 Id. 406. .',\n",

Ejectment: Ouster — Rights of tenant in common. 1. A husband’s testimony in a suit to which his wife was not a party, that he held certain land and built a fence around it as agent of the wife, is not admissible in evidence against her to show an ouster, in. ejectment against both for said land. 2. Such testimony, if admitted, would not show an ouster, where the plaintiff claims only an undivided two-thirds of the land, and the wife (being on the land, claiming an interest,) may be presumed (in the absence of evidence to the contrary) to have owned the other third. APPEAL from the Circuit Court for Winnebago County. Ejectment, for an undivided two-thirds of two acres of land, part of'a certain fractional lot two; the boundaries of which part are described as commencing at the southwest corner of said fractional lot, thence running north along Wolf river 240 feet, thence east 350 feet to a certain fixed point, thence south 240 feet, thence west to the place of beginning. The complaint, after duly averring ownership, etc., in the plaintiff, alleges that on the 16th of October, 1866, he was ousted by the defendant Johanna Larsen, who has since held and still unlawfully holds possession, and excludes the plaintiff, etc. Onon Larsen is made defendant as husband of said Johanna. The joint answer of the defendants admits plaintiff’s title, and that said Johanna is the lawful wife of said Onon, and denies the other allegations of the complaint. On the trial (at the March term, 1867), the evidence introduced by the plaintiff was in substance as follows: One Christensen, whose land was adjacent to the tract in dispute, testified that his north fence was on the south side of said tract, the river on the west, and Larsen had a fence on the north, and there was then no fence on the east line, but there was another piece of land on that side enclosed with the premises in dispute, making together a field of six or eight acres. About an acre of the disputed tract lies between the river and a road running over said tract from witness’s land. The whole of the field above described was enclosed in July, 1864, except said acre. In the spring of 1866, Larsen, by removing a fence previously maintained by him on one side of said road, and putting a gate across the road, threw said acre into said field. In 1866 this field was occupied for pasture, Larsen having some cattle on it, and a Mr. Johnson some sheep. One-half or three-fourths of an acre of the premises in dispute was ploughed in the fall of 1866, by one Onsen, brother of Mrs. Larsen. Witness had always seen Onsen work for Larsen. No other part of the field was ploughed. In the fall of 1866 Yager tried to build a fence. He had some posts there, part of which lay on the disputed land near the line; and they dug post holes fourteen or fifteen feet west of the line. Witness saw Larsen- on the land frequently during 1866; he and Larsen tried to dig a fountain on the line in July of that year; never saw him doing any work on the land except in digging the fountain and building the gate above mentioned ; never saw Mrs. Larsen there; Larsen’s family lived a quarter or half mile away, and not on adjoining land. One Eorbes, a justice of the peace, testified that he recollected a suit before him, between Yager and Larsen. “ It was a trespass suit about this same land, fence and posts. He \\\\_Larsen] testified as to building fence. He said he built fence as agent for his wife. My impression is, that he testified about the possession of the land — that his wife had possession, or he did as agent for his wife. My minutes, however, do not show that.” On cross-examination: “ It was a fence on one of the lines that Larsen spoke of; I can’t tell which. The question was asked, and he said he was acting as agent for Ms wife. I think lie also stated -that lie occupied it as agent for Ms wife, -but-1 am not positive; my impression was, that in relation to that land he was acting as agent for his wife.” Christensen, being re-called, testified that he was present at the trial before Eorbes, and that Larsen was asked if he built fence and made improvements on the land as agent for his wife, and he said he did. The plaintiff testified that in July, 1866, he put fence posts on said land, and on the 18th of October, undertook to build a fence on the land, and after he had built a portion of it, Larsen■ and his men forcibly took the fence and posts’ away. Witness further said : “ Larsen ploughed one-haif or three-fourths of an acre. I told him to stop; he told me I had nothing to say about it, and kept on ploughing. I heard his testimony in the suit before Eorbes. He pretended to hold possession of the land as general agent for his wife.” On cross-examination, he testified that at the time. he was trying to put up a fence on the land, Larsen claimed to hold the land under, a tax title owned by oneAllen. “ I saw Allen about his claim, but did not buy it. I bought of Mrs. G-umaer, and claimed under her, and Larsen under a tax title.” On re-direct examination, plaintiff further testified that it was about the last of July, 1866, that Larsen told him about the tax title. Plaintiff then put in evidence, two tax deeds, 1. One to Johanna Larsen, dated September 10, 1866, of undivided eighteen acres of said fractional lot 2. Received against objection. 2. One to said Allen, dated November 11, 1865, of undivided 25 acres of said fractional lot 2. Thereupon, plaintiff having rested, defendants moved for a nonsuit, which was denied. Onon Larsen then testified for the defense : “ I took possession three years ago of part of fractional lot 2, down to the road; built a fence, on the north side and along the road three years ago; .did not fence from the road down to the river; there was an old fence from tie road to the river; I put in the gate and removed the fence on east side of the road a year ago this spring. ■ I was asked on the trial before Forbes, if I built the fence as agent for my wife; I said I supposed I did; she owned an interest there; I was in possession when this suit was commenced; I was holding -J- for my wife, and the rest under Allen, under his tax title; I had held under it since a year ago last fall; I have been in possession since I built the gate till this suit commenced; I was. not asked before Eorhes if I.held possession for my wife.” On cross-examination : “ I own no lands in my own name; I carry on my wife’s business; have charge of her real estate; I never claimed to .hold this land under tax deed to. Johanna Larsen.”- The court found the facts as alleged in the complaint, and that the damages for the wrongful detention were six cents; and, as a conclusion of law, that plaintiff was entitled to judgment against both defendants, for a recovery of possession and the damages. Judgment accordingly; from which both defendants appealed. Gary g Burnell, for appellants. Felker & Weisbrod, for respondent.\",\n",

       "  'case_summary': \"Hannah T. Omensetter v. Henry Kemper, Appellant. Evidence — Trespass—Res gestee — Measure of damages. The question being one of trespass in illegally closing plaintiff’s winclow overlooking property belonging to wife of defendant, evidence is properly admissible as to conduct and declarations of the defendant in regard to consenting to the erection of the windows as bearing on a license from the wife as well as to alleged bad faith, recklessness or oppression of the defendant; the evidence being pertinent in any event, irrespective of the wife’s title and defendant’s inability to bind her, if it appeared that plaintiff’s property was built within her own line, tending as it did to furnish some guidance as to the measure of damage. Evidence— Witness cannot be made the arbiter. Where the issue turned on the proper division line between two properties a question is properly excluded when, to have allowed the witness to have answered it, would have made him the arbiter of the whole question of title, including the application of the statute of limitation. Practice, Superior Court — Unfair assignment — Excerpt from charge. An assignment of error is unfair and defective which complains of an excerpt from the charge, wrested from its context, when, if all that was said in the instruction complained of had been quoted, it would appear that the matter in dispute had been left entirely to the jury. Practice — Review—Charge of court — Comment on evidence. The'question turning on the accuracy of certain measurements made, on the one hand by trained surveyors and on the other, by unskilled persons, it was not error for the court to call the attention of the jury to the fact that defendant’s measurements were made by “ a baker attended by a tinsmith under the supervision of a lawyer.” This is not such departure from judicial gravity as to call for a reversal. Trespass — Tille by possession — Burden of proof on defendant. Mere possession is in itself a form of title, and he who interferes therewith must be prepared to show a better titled Plaintiff having been in possession of her house and defendant having invaded her possession, by obstructing her windows, the burden devolved upon him to explain or justify his acts. Division fence — Consentable line — Statute of limitations — Burden of proof. The mere calling a fence a division fence does not make it one. It is the duty of a party, relying on a fence as a division one, to supply the jury with the requisite facts. A consentable line is not established merely by an existing fence when its character is only accounted for during ten or twelve years. Argued Oct. 5, 1897. Appeal, No. 38, Oct. T., 1897, by defendant, from judgment of G. P. No. 4, Phila. Go., June T., 1896, No. 565, on verdict for plaintiff. Before Rice, P. J., Wickham, Beaver, Reedeb, Oblajdy, Smith and Porter, JJ. Affirmed. Trespass quare clausum fregit to recover damages for obstruction to plaintiff’s light and air by nailing up her windows. Before Ahdenreid, J. The facts sufficiently appear in the opinion of tbe court. Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $183.33. Plaintiff appealed. Errors assigned were (1-3) In admitting questions propounded' to plaintiff’s witnesses as to conversations which had taken place, between them and the defendant. (4) In overruling the following question propounded to Joseph Thorp: “ Q. Assuming that the fence line as you have put it on the plan was the fence as it has been in existence as testified to by Mr. Kemper, and running that fence out upon the straight line as Mr. Kemper testified that the fence did run to Leverington avenue, state to' the court and jury whether or not that would show that the plaintiff’s property was built over Mrs. Kemper’s property.” (5-8) In charging the jury as follows : “ As Mrs. Omensetter was, undoubtedly, in possession of that house and every part of it, including not only its interior, but also the wall in which these windows were opened, it would appear that her possession has been invaded, and that she is therefore entitled to recover damages at your hands in this action, unless the defendant can explain and justify his acts. ... As the plaintiff is in the possession of the property No. 518 Leverington avenue you are bound to start out with the presumption that she is lawfully in possession of it, and that her title is co-extensive with her possession. It’lies on the defendant to show that that house is not within the plaintiff’s own lot, and that the division line is not to the northeast of the wall in which the windows and doors open. .... The only question of doubt in Mr. Thorp’s determination of the location of the southwest line of the Kemper lot is as to whether he carefully measured the distance of one hundred and ninety-six feet one inch from the corner of Ridge avenue. I do not think that there is chance for a mistake in this calculation at any other point. . . . The measurements made for the defendant were made by a baker, attended by a tinsmith, under the supervision of a lawyer. It does not appear that any of these gentlemen ever made a land measurement before.” (9) In affirming plaintiff’s second point, which point is as follows: “ If the jury believe from the evidence that the defendant gave a license to the plaintiff to erect the windows in question and in consequence of which license plaintiff went to an expense by building her house upon a different plan from that which she Avould have adopted if such license had not been given, then the license was irrevocable, and in no aspect has the defendant a right to nail the obstructions to plaintiff’s window.” (10) In refusing to charge the jury as requested for the defendant as follows : “It is the uncontradicted testimony of the defendant that the division line between the property of plaintiff and Catharine Kemper for upwards of twenty-one years next preceding the erection of plaintiff’s house was marked by a straight fence as shown on the plan of survey which jmu have in evidence. I instruct you if you find the said fence to have existed as testified to, and that the plaintiff’s house is upon or over the line as so established, then your verdict must be for the defendant.” (11) The damages found by the jury were excessive. W. Horace Hepburn, for appellant. The only question before the court below on the trial of this case was as to the location of the division line between the defendant’s lot and the plaintiff’s property. The evidence admitted under the first three assignments of error were irrelevant and prejudicial and should have been excluded: Bank v. Gillespie, 115 Pa. 564. The affirmance of the plaintiff’s second point as set out in the 9th assignment of error, did not tend in the least possible way to enlighten and help the jury, but did tend to convey the impression that the defendant had committed a wrongful act. The burden of proof should be upon the plaintiff, and not, as stated by the court, upon the defendant: Wolf v. Wolf, 158 Pa. 621. The line fence had been recognized for a period beyond the statute of limitations and should not have been disturbed: McCormick v. Barnum, 10 Wend. 104. Long acquiescence by one in a line assumed by the other is evidence of an agreement: Kip v. Norton, 12 Wend. 127; Hunt v. Johnson, 19 N. Y. 279. A great number of cases confirming the doctrine as stated above may be found in Tyler’s Law of Boundaries, Fences and Window Lights, at pages 288 to 294. . The description of the persons testifying as to the measurements for defendant was couched in language by the trial judge tending to produce a mirthful effect upon the jury, and it had that effect as it brought forth a laugh from them. . Francis S. Cantrell and Francis S. Cantrell, Jr., for appellee. —There was no evidence in this case of a consentable line recog nized for a period long enough to invoke the statute of limitations. The evidence sufficiently established the proposition that plaintiff had built her house within her own line, and that the act of the defendant was an unwarrantable trespass. January 18, 1898: The comments of the court complained of in the assignments of error were mere proper expressions of opinion by the court: Com. v. Orr, 138 Pa. 276.\",\n",

       "  'case_summary': \"George P. Hooper versus Horace Cummings. In a deed, the words “providing they (the grantees) fence the land and keep it in repair,” create a condition subsequent, which is to be taken most strongly against the grantor, to prevent a forfeiture. Where the land has remained more than líÉf years unfenced, it is a breach of the condition; but, if the grantor with full knowledge of the breach of the condition, in the mean time, does not complain, enter or take any action to reclaim the land, it will be evidence tending to show a waiver of the condition. At common law, none but the grantor, his heirs and legal representatives, can take advantage of a breach of condition subsequent. When condition is annexed to a particular estate and afterwards by another deed the reversion is granted by the maker of the condition, the condition is gone. Trespass, quare clausum, commenced July 25, 1856. Plea, general issue, with a brief statement, the substantial matter of which is: — That, on the 6th day of April, 1803, Jonathan Cummings, the defendant’s father, being lawfully seized in fee of the close described in the plaintiff’s writ, in consideration of ten dollars, conveyed the same to Nathan Wood-bury, and four other persons named, all of Paris, being a committee appointed to build a meeting-house in said town, and to the proprietors of said house, their heirs and assigns, “provided the said committee and proprietors would fence said land and keep the same in repair.” That, on said 20th day of April, 1856, [the day of the alleged trespass,] said committee and proprietors all and each of them neglected and refused to fence said land and keep the same in repair, and, for a long and unreasonable length of time prior thereto, to wit, for fifteen years, had neglected and refused to fence said land, and permitted the same to remain common and unfenced during all that time. Whereupon the said Jonathan Cummings, in his own right, and the said Horace Cummings, by the command of, and as the agent and servant of the said Jonathan, on the said 20th day of April, 1856, entered into said close and took possession thereof, for breach and non-performance of said condition to fence and keep the same in repair, and for the purpose of revesting the estate, title and fee of said close, in the said Jonathan; and the said Jonathan Cummings, in his own right, and the defendant, as his servant, and by his direction, plowed and planted a small portion of said close, which, and the said entry, are the trespasses complained of in the plaintiff’s writ. Moses Hammond was admitted, under the statute, as a co-plaintiff. At the August term, 1857, Cutting, J., presiding, the trial of the action was commenced. The plaintiff introduced the following evidence: — Deed from John Porter to plaintiff, dated Dec. 3, 1838, recorded Eeb. 13,1857, conveying to plaintiff pew No. 41, in the new meeting-house on Paris Hill, in Paris, and one undivided sixty-fourth part of the remainder of said house, except the pews, and one undivided sixty-fourth part of the common around the same. Also, a deed from same to Moses Hammond, of same date, conveying another pew, otherwise, the same. The close described in said deeds is the same described in the writ. Also, a deed from Jonathan Cummings to Nathan Wood-bury, Jairus Shaw, Ebenezer Rawson, Lemuel Jackson, Jr., and Benjamin Hammond, being a committee appointed to build a meeting-house in said town, and to the proprietors of said house, dated April 6, 1803, recorded Sept. 14, 1804, conveying the close in controversy, “ providing the said committee and proprietors fence the said land and keep the same in repair.” Also, a deed from Jonathan Cummings to Jesse Cummings, dated Feb. 20, 1804, recorded Sept. 8, 1806, conveying all the residue of his land, &c. Also, Sylvanus Jackson, aged 73 years, testified that the meeting-house was built in 1803; that a fence was built at that time on the north side of the lot, and soon after the house was built, there was a fence on the south side, but does not know if there was a fence on the west side until Doct. Hamlin built it, soon after the meeting-house was built, after which, there was always a fence round the lot, except on the road, and, after the county common was laid out and the county buildings were erected, the fence included that. The proprietors have since occupied it, sometimes used as a training field. The witness further stated that he had not examined the fence since 1840, and in 1815, moved to where he now lives, two and one-half miles from this place. Jonathan Cummings lived on the road directly opposite to the meeting-house. The witness never knew him to claim to own the land since the meeting-house was built. Also, Moses Hammond, who testified that he was sixty-six years of age, and had lived forty years on Paris Hill. The common has been fenced on the north, west and south sides until the county purchased their lot, when the two commons were fenced together, and, when the county jail was erected, they took the fence away. The new fence round the common was built six years ago, and includes the place of the trespass. The witness never knew Jonathan Cummings to claim any interest in this lot since he conveyed it to the committee. Since 1840, there has not been a fence the whole way from Bemis’ to the west line of the lot. I mean the south line of the lot on the plan; on this line, there is no fence now, nor has there been on the whole of it since 1840. In defence: — Horace Cummings, defendant, testified that in April, 1856, by direction of his father, Jonathan Cummings, he went on to this lot, plowed up a small part of it, and planted it with potatoes. His father had previously staked it out, and said he claimed the property under the deed. We acted by advice of counsel. My father had given us a quit-claim deed of this land previous to this time. Plaintiff here offered a copy of a deed from Jonathan Cummings to Horace and George Cummings, dated Dec. 29, 1855. I have not that deed now in my possession. I do not know where it is. Here, defendant’s counsel objected to what the witness had previously stated as to the deed. Also, George H. Cummings, who testified, I went with my father when he staked out a piece of land, which I and Horace afterwards plowed. When my father was on the land, he said he went there because they had forfeited it. He said he wanted to pre-empt it, or something like it, and then claimed it as his. Also, Jonathan Cummings, who testified, I am now eighty-five years old. I went on and staked out a piece on this lot for my boys to plow. I claimed it then, because the committee had not fulfilled the conditions in the deed, and directed the boys to take possession of the lot as mine. After the foregoing evidence was introduced, by agreement of parties, the case was taken from the jury, and, on report of the evidence by the presiding Judge, submitted to the full Court, who are to render such judgment by nonsuit or default, as may be conformable to law and the facts. The writ, pleadings, deeds, and office copies of any other deeds pertinent to the issue, legally admissible, which either party may introduce at the hearing, are referred to and made part of the case. R. K. Goodenow, argued for plaintiffs: — 1. The words of condition are of no effect, being insufficient to prevent the title from passing without limitation. Freeman's Bank v. Vose, 23 Maine, 98; Abbott v. Pike, 33 Maine, 204. 2. If of any effect, they are operative on the covenant of warranty, and. not upon the title. 3. If they must be regarded as applicable to the grant, they only impose on the grantee the obligation to fence, and to relieve the grantors from fencing., Newell v. Hill, 2 Met. 280. 4. If they can be regarded as making a condition attached to the grant, the condition is a condition subsequent, and advantage can be taken of a breach only by an entry for that purpose by the owner of the reserved right. R. S., c. 73, § 1; Bangor v. Warren, 34 Maine, 525; Maverick v. Andrews, 25 Maine, 505, and cases cited. 5. But there has been a performance to the acceptance of the grantor, and those owning the adjoining lands, for more than fifty years, and a waiver of all objection, and the grantor has, since 1804, ceased to have any interest in the adjoining lands. Record & Walton, for the defendant: — 1. To the point that the deed was conditional, cited, Gray v. Blanchard, 8 Pick. 284; Hayden v. Stoughton, 5 Pick. 528; Taylor’s Landlord & Tenant, § 279, p. 178; Comyn’s Dig. Condition, A, 2 ; Webster’s Quarto Dictionary, Provided. 2. To the point, that to fence, is to inclose with a hedge, wall, line of posts and rails, or something else that will prevent the escape or entrance of cattle, and that the whole of said land was to be thus inclosed, cited, 1 Glreenl. Ev. § 278; Webster’s Quarto Diet., Fence, n, fence, v. 3. To the point that Jonathan Cummings, having the jus disponendi, had a lawful right to annex this condition, the same not being illegal, repugnant or impossible, cited Taylor’s Landlord & Tenant § 280; Broom’s Legal Maxims, (4th ed.,) p. 299. 4. To the point that the condition is valid and ought to be regarded, nothwithstanding Cummings, the grantor, may have no special interest in its performance, cited Gray v. Blanchard, 8 Pick. 284; Jackson v. Brownell, 1 Johns. 267. 5. To the point, as a matter of fact, that the condition has not been performed, attention is called to the testimony of Moses Hammond, one of the plaintiffs, on cross-examination where he says, “ that since 1840, there has not been a fence the whole way on the south line of the lot, and that for about six years, there has been no fence on any portion of it,” and, to the deed, where the length of this south line will be found to be 19 rods, and to the fact there is no pretence that there has ever been a fence between this land and the highway by which it is bounded. 6. To the point that the obligation “to fence said land and keep the same in repair,” being continuous and the breach continuous, lapse of time will not create a limitation bar, or be evidence of dispensation or waiver of the condition, cited Bleecker v. Smith, 13 Wend. 530; Jackson v. Allen, 3 Cowen, 220. 7. To the point that the entry of Jonathan Cummings defeated the estate of the plaintiffs and revested the title in him and he became seized of his original estate in the premises, cited 1 Hill.

       "  'case_summary': 'Dhein, Respondent, vs. Beuscher and others, Appellants. October 1 October 25, 1892. Adverse p>ossession: Division fences: Trespass. 1. The grantee of a specifically described tract of land cannot tack the possession of her grantors to her own in order to make out ad verse possession for twenty years of a strip of land adjacent to that granted, but which is not included in any of the conveyances constituting her chain of title, and as to which there is no privity between her and her grantors. 2. The question whether, in this case, the owners of adjacent lands had agreed upon and established a dividing line, and had actually claimed and occupied the land up to said line on each side continuously for twenty years, was properly submitted to the jury. 3. Where, by reason of a division fence not being on the true line, the owner of a certain tract of land was in possession also of an adjacent strip, to which, however, she had not acquired title by prescription, and the owner of such strip peaceably and without objection entered thereon and constructed a new fence upon the true line, the subsequent taking down and removal of such new fence by the land-owner first mentioned was a trespass for which \\'the owner of the strip may maintain an action. APPEAL from the Circuit Court for Washington County. The plaintiff complained of the defendants for breaking and entering premises May 28,1891, of which he claimed to be the owner and in possession, being the S. ~W. \\\\ of the N. W. J of section 16, etc., and tearing down and destroying á certain fence thereon, to his damage $50. There was a second count, alleging trespass to the plaintiff’s crops and fences three days thereafter. The defendants answered by. general denial, and also claiming that the part of the real estate and fence mentioned in plaintiff’s complaint upon which the alleged trespass was charged to have been committed was not the real estate and fence of the plaintiff, nor was he then in or entitled to possession thereof, but the same was at the time, etc., the property of the defendant Sarah Beusoher, and in her possession; and that the said several supposed acts of trespass were done or caused to be done by her and her codefendants in and about her own lands in the management of the same, as she might lawfully do. The testimony disclosed the fact that the dispute between the parties was in respect to the proper location of the line, eighty rods in length, between their respective estates. The fence that had originally been built between the two estates, and according to which they had been used and occupied, stood over on the premises, as it was claimed, of the plaintiff, leaving a strip of nearly six tenths of an acre in extent claimed by the plaintiff within the inclosure of the defendants’ farm. This rail fence had been maintained for twenty-five or thirty years by the respective parties, their grantors and predecessors in interest, and it was claimed on behalf of the defendants that the defendant Sarah Beusoher and her grantors and predecessors in interest had held said strip of land adversely for more than twenty years, claiming title thereto, and so was entitled to the same, and that, as it was inclosed as a part of her field, tbe plaintiff was not in possession of it so as to be entitled to\\' maintain an action of trespass as for breaking and entering his close. The forty-acre tract of land of the defendant Sarah Smsoher was owned by Peter IClumb until August 30,1855, when he conveyed the same to D. IClumb, who, on the 26th of April, 1864, conveyed to Philip Beuscher, Sr., and he, on the 1st of October, 1870, conveyed the premises to Philip Beuscher, Jr., who, on January 6, 1887, conveyed them to Philip Beuscher, Sr., and he on the same day conveyed them to Sarah Beuscher, the defendant. The proof showed that the grantors and predecessors in interest of the defendant Sarah Beuscher had cultivated and occupied the land up to the fence which had originally been constructed and continually maintained, and which was supposed at the time to have been built on the line when the land was first cleared. The old line or fence wa$ curved. In some places it was twenty feet, in some twenty-eight feet, and in some ten feet from the true line. David IClumb testified that he occupied the land claimed by the defendant Sarah Beuscher from 1855 to 1864; that there was a rail fence between this tract and plaintiff’s land. The land was cleared about one third the length of the line on one side up to the fence, and he cultivated clear up to the fenee, and claimed the land up to the fence all the time he was in possession.- He and Dhein, plaintiff’s grantor, repaired this fence. Dhein’s share was the south part, and IClumb’s the north part. The line was surveyed by Brosius twice, and the fenee found to be on the line. Philip Beuscher testified that after he bought of IClumb he claimed up to the -fence. Dhein owned on the other side, but it was all woods, and no one lived on it. Philip Dhein and his father had possession. “ Crops were raised on my side down to the present time. The fenee has stood there ever since. My son Philip occupied it in the same manner after I sold to him in 1870. In 1878 he died, and I bought the land, and conveyed it to the defendant Scvrah Beuscher, his wife.” When Philip Beuscher, Jr., owned the land, and before he conveyed to the defendant Sa/rah Beuscher, and on the .11th day of.May, 1885,he entered intoan agreement with the plaintiff, reciting that the parties thereto “are the owners of adjoining lands,” dividing the line between them, which is described as follows, to wit: “ Commencing at a point, being the southeast corner of the southwest quarter of the northwest quarter of section sixteen,” etc.; “ from thence running north to the northeast corner of the said southwest quarter of the northwest quarter of said section, the same being a distance of eighty rods. Said Philip I)hein is the owner of the land on the west side, and Philip Beuscher, Jr., is the owner of the land on the east side of said line, and they desire to make partition of said line so as to ascertain and assign to each said owner h.is portion of the partition fence to be built and maintained thereon.” And it was in and by said agreement agreed that such line “ be, and the same is hereby, partitioned and assigned as follows, to wit: The south half thereof, being about forty rods, more or less, shall belong and is hereby assigned to the said Philip Beuscher, Jr., and the north half thereof, being an equal length, shall belong and is hereby assigned to the said Philip Dhein. Both parties agree to keep their fence in good repair.” This agreement was sealed, witnessed by two witnesses, and acknowledged, and tiled of record in the office of the town clerk of the town, May 11, 1885. There was a survey made of the line between the premises in May, 1886, by a Mr. Leins, while Philip Beuscher, Jr., owned the premises, and he was present and assisted in making it, and in carrying the chain, when the line was established and found to be as claimed by the plaintiff. This was after the execution of the agreement referred to. Immediately afterwards the plaintiff, Dhein, commenced building a fence on the new line, and built and completed about seven or eight rods, and he took down the old fence opposite to where this portion of the fence stood, and this was the condition of things when the defendaht /Sarah Beuscher bought her property. In the spring of 1891 the plaintiff, Dhein, built about thirty rods more of post and wire fence on the line, as thus surveyed, between him and the defendant; \\'and testimony was given that about the 28th of May thirty rods of the fence was torn down by the defendants, the posts were taken out, and the whole was thrown on one side; that he rebuilt it again two days thereafter, when it was torn down again, and the posts sawed off. Evidence was given tending to show the damages. The defendants’ counsel asked the court to charge the jury (1) that the plaintiff could not recover unless he had actual and lawful possession of the premises at the time when the alleged trespass was committed; that if the defendant\\' Sarah Beuscher was in the actual possession of said lands at the time and place where the trespass was committed, then the plaintiff could not recover. The court refused -to so instruct the jury. He also requested the court to charge the jury (2) that, if they found that the old rail fence was erected by a former owner of the land, and consented and agreed to by Philip Dhein, Sr., the father of the plaintiff, and agreed upon as the dividing line between their respective premises .in 1853, and that they and the subsequent owners of the said premises actually claimed and occupied the lands on each side of the rail fence continuously for twenty years or more prior to the time when such new fence was placed on the land by the plaintiff, such possession would be adverse, and confer a title in fee by prescription; and that it \"was immaterial ■whether this old division fence was built and maintained on the exact line between the adjacent lands or not; (3) that the agreement to divide\\' the line in 1885, after the title in fee had ripened by adverse possession, would not work a change of the old line; but the court refused to so charge. The circuit judge charged the jury that to constitute adverse possession of the premises, the possession must be under claim of title, and be continuous. The premises must be inclosed by an inclosure, or occupied in the usual way of farming lands. That the important question in the case was whether this old rail fence was established as a true line between the parties, or whether it was a matter of convenience in an early day when the ground was covered with timber, and when they were not perhaps as particular. Was it a temporary arrangement until after they could determine the line? The possession, to be adverse, must be under a claim of title. There must be some evidence that the parties agreed upon the old fence as the true line; or did each occupy up to the old fence, claiming title? You are to determine from the evidence whether the old line or fence was intended to be a division between the parties and a location of the true line,-or whether it was a temporary expedient for the time being. That, if they found that the defendant, and those under whom she claimed, had held the premises under claim of title, claiming the old fence was the true line and that they were the owners of all on the east side of the fence, and had occupied it all the time up to this time, that was a perfect defense ; but, if it was not under a claim of title to the land on the east side, and was a temporary arrangement, then the plaintiff was entitled to recover. That, if the plaintiff has got the legal title, and there has been no adverse possession under the rule thus given, plaintiff should recover. That, in determining the question of adverse possession, the jury should take into consideration all the surrounding circumstances of the case as developed by the evidence, what the parties have done, the written agree ment, what that was intended to accomplish, and what light they might throw upon the question. The jury found the line surveyed in 1885 by Charles Leins to be the true line, and found for the plaintiff, assessing his damages in the sum of $15, and from judgment on the verdict the defendants appealed. For the appellants there was a brief by Frisby & Miller, and oral argument by J. N. Frisby. They contended, inter alia, that the plaintiff had. not the actual possession of the premises when the injury was committed, and therefore cannot maintain trespass. Gunsolus v.

If defendant’s acts of trespass deprived-plaintiff of possession and gave it to the defendant, the plaintiff’s acts in peaceably re-entering and building the fence upon the true line deprived her of possession and restored it to him.

Crawford, Judge. Statement by Mr. Justice Moore. This is a suit by J. B. Ready against Henry Schmith to enforce the specific performance of a parol contract to convey real property. The facts are, that the defendant is the owner of lot 1, section 4, township 5 north, range 45 east of the Willamette meridian, in Wallowa County, and the plaintiff owns 40 acres of land which joins such lot on the south. The parties hereto, about October 1, 1904, made an oral agreement whereby the defendant, in consideration of securing a half interest in a fence owned by the plaintiff, stipulated to convey to the latter, a tract of land 20 rods east and west, and 8 rods north and south, from the southwest corner of such lot, and to execute to him a deed therefor when the premises should be released from the lien of a mortgage. The fence mentioned is built on the north boundary of the plaintiff’s land, and extends east thereof and nearly across a 40-acre tract which lies immediately south of other lands owned by the defendant. That part of the fence extending east of the plaintiff’s premises is slightly deflected to the south. It was agreed that the maintenance of the fence should be equally borne by the parties. The plaintiff was permitted to take possession of the land specified, upon which he erected a barn and made other improvements. He also constructed across his land' another fence a short distance south of, but parallel with, his north boundary. The defendant joined his fences to such boundary fence, a part of which he reset. The mortgage specified having been discharged, the defendant was requested to execute a deed of the land agreed to be conveyed, but he refused to comply therewith, whereupon this suit was instituted, the complaint stating the facts in substance as hereinbefore detailed. The answer admits the making of the contract and avers, in effect, that the plaintiff stipulated to execute to the defendant a deed to a half interest in the fence; that he would move the east part of it north to the defendant’s boundary and keep half of the entire line in repair; that the defendant has been ready, able, and willing to perform his part of the agreement, but the plaintiff failed to move such part of the fence or to maintain any of it, and to compel the defendant to bear the entire expense of making the repairs, the plaintiff built a fence just south of the boundary; and that he also failed to tender to the defendant any written evidence of a transfer of the title to a half interest in such fence. The reply denies the material allegations of new matter in the answer, upon which issues the cause was tried, resulting in a decree as prayed for in the complaint, and the defendant appeals. Modified and Affirmed. For appellant there was a brief and an oral argument by Mr. O. M. .Corkins. For respondent there was a brief over the names of Burleigh & Boyd, with an oral argument by Mr. James A. Burleigh.\",\n",

[To be reported.] The act of March 23, 1865, P. L. 42, providing that any person who shall “ maliciously or wantonly break or throw down any post and rail or other fence, erected for the enclosure of land,” etc., shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, etc., does not apply to the tearing down of a fence in the honest exercise of a supposed legal right. Before Paxson, C. J., Sterrett, Green, Clark, Williams, McCollum and Mitchell, JJ. No. 4 October Term 1891, Sup. Ct.; court below, No. 56 September Term 1890, Q. S. On September 4,1890, the grand jury returned as a true bill an indictment in a single count, charging that Ellen Drass, Charles Drass and- others, the defendants, on August 2,1890, with force and arms did wilfully, wantonly and maliciously break and throw down a post and picket fence, erected for the enclosure of a lot of ground belonging to one Catharine Mc-Closkey, contrary to the form of the statute, etc. The defendants pleaded not guilty. At the trial, on September 11, 1890, the testimony for the commonwealth tended to show that Catharine McCloskey was the owner of a lot of ground in Gallitzin, on which she resided with her husband; that, in the summer of 1890, her husband built a fence intended to enclose the lot; that this fence was built so as to extend to within eighteen inches of the house of Ellen Drass, enclosing the greater part of a strip of ground, about fifteen feet wide, between the McCloskey house and the Drass house, that had formerly been allowed to lie open; that on August 2, 1890, about nine o’clock P. M., Ellen Drass and Charles Drass, appeared in company with the other defendants whose assistance they had obtained, and tore down a part of the fence, chopping up the materials; that Mr. McCloskey re- • built the fence, and on the night of August 12, 1890, between eleven and twelve o’clock, some of the defendants again tore it away; that on each of these occasions the tearing away of the fence was done in a tumultuous and noisy manner,'accompanied by threats that it would be torn down as fast as McCloskey could put it up; that in one instance a revolver was drawn by one of the defendants, in connection with the making of such a threat; that seven persons, besides Ellen and Charles Drass, were engaged in the affair on the first occasion, and six persons on the second, a number of whom appeared to be intoxicated. On cross-examination of the commonwealth’s witnesses, it appeared that for some time there had been a dispute between Mrs. McCloskey and Mrs. Drass, in regard to the strip of ground between their respective houses, the exact nature of which did not clearly appear, though the testimony seemed to indicate that it related to the ownership of that ground. At the close of the commonwealth’s case, the district attorney stated to the court that he did not ask for the conviction of any of the defendants except Mrs. Drass, and two others who were members of her family. Ellen Drass having taken the stand as a witness, defendants’ counsel offered to prove by her that “ the defendants did not tear or take down the fence in question wantonly, nor wilfully, nor maliciously; but in justification of their right to go out and in on their own property.” Objected to, by the district attorney. By the court: Objection sustained; offer excluded; exception.1 The defendants then proposed to prove “ by the witness on the stand and other witnesses, that they are defendants in the criminal court and have a right to be heard to justify the defendants from the charge in the indictment.” The district attorney objected that the evidence of justification could not be admitted, the defendants not undertaking to deny the offence as made out by the commonwealth’s witnesses; in fact, admitting it by their offer to justify. By the court: Objection sustained and offer refused; exception.8 The testimony being closed, the court Johnston, P. J., citing the act of March 23, 1865, P. L. 42, charged the jury in part as follows: [This act of assembly was passed to meet precisely such cases as this, and to keep peace among the good citizens of this commonwealth. There have frequently been unseemly riots and even bloodshed on this very question; and it is to prevent scenes of this kind that all parties are required to go into the civil courts of this commonwealth to try the rights of the parties.] 3 The prosecutor in this case built a fence enclosing what he claims to be his boundary around his lot. [It was peaceably and quietly built, and no objection or pretence of objection was made to the building of the fence.] 4 It was constructed at times when he was released from his other labors, and it took some time for its construction, as the witnesses have testified ; [and when it was completed, without any objection or remonstrance of any kind, or any resort to any civil proceedings to prevent him as a trespasser, or any other way, in the night-time,-—-one of the trespasses at 9 o’clock at night or after-wards, and the other at 11 o’clock, a force of men, in one case seven and in the other eight, appeared upon the ground and the fence was destroyed, removed, torn down. This is an express violation of the act of assembly that I have read.] 5 I do not pretend to say that this prosecutor, Mr. MeCloskey, was on the true line of his property; but that question is not a question for the Court of Quarter Sessions, which is a court only for the purpose of punishing crime. He may have been mistaken for all that we know. If he was, there are the fullest means of rectifying that mistake, in the civil courts of this commonwealth. The purpose of the law is to prevent men, or women either, from taking the law into their own hands. Supposing that this prosecutor, when an effort was made to tear down this fence, had rallied a force to protect it, there might have been an assault and battery, perhaps a riot and bloodshed; and hence the necessity of the act, to punish in the criminal courts acts of this kind, where parties recklessly and rashly take the law into their own hands, and commit acts that are made offences by the act of assembly, instead of waiting for a peaceable decision in the civil courts. This defendant, [Mrs. Drass, may have thought she had some grievance. We cannot say she had not; but she cannot redress them by the strong arm of force, aided by a crowd of men in the night. That is not the proper way for her to obtain her rights if she has sustained any wrong. The main offence is clearly made out.] 6 The defendants offer to justify here, by some claim of title that they have; but we cannot try titles in the Quarter Sessions. We cannot go into this question here at all. We have another court, another jurisdiction, that would quietly and patiently hear these parties in another tribunal; but here is a plain and'palpable infraction of the law, and courts and juries have no course but to find the defendants guilty; and having found them guilty, the court may, in passing sentence, consider such mitigating circumstances as are presented to it. On the plain facts in this case, the offence here charged was committed; and it cannot be justified by the, claim that this fence was in the wrong place. That would involve a land trial, where land titles are not tried, in the Court of Quarter Sessions. The law aims to prevent such reckless acts performed in the night time; and if the prosecutor had stood in defence of his property and raised a crowd to oppose the taking away of the fence, the effort to take it away would have been followed, in all probability, by a much more serious offence. [We have no remedy in this case but to direct that the case is made out, and that the defence has failed entirely to show any reason why these parties should not be convicted. Your verdict, under the circumstances, must necessarily be for the commonwealth, because there is no reasonable doubt or any question here in regard to the commission of the act itself.] 7 The prosecution is not pressed against those who were merely employees of these parties..... —The jury returned a verdict finding Ellen Drass and Charles Drass guilty as indicted, and the other defendants not guilty. A motion for a new trial having been overruled, the court sentenced the defendants, Ellen Drass and Charles Drass, to pay a fine of ten dollars, one half thereof to be paid to the prosecutrix, Catharine McCloskey; and to pay the costs of prosecution. Thereupon, having obtained a special allocatur, said defendants took this appeal assigning for error: 1, 2. The refusal of defendants’ offers.1 8 3-7.

The purpose of that act was to prevent riot, breach of the peace, and bloodshed. Such conduct as was proved against the defendants in the present case, was certainly malicious and unjustifiable. The defendants had no right to take the law into their own hands, and in doing so they violated the provisions of the statute. * Observe, the indictment charged only the malicious removal of the fence.\",\n",

       "  'case_summary': \"Griffin's Appeal. 1. Where there is no dedication of land to public use by the owner, use of the same by the public jointly with the owner and by his sufferance, does not establish a right in the public by dedication, no matter how long such joint use is continued. Dedication is a matter of intention, ana when clearly proved, is as complete in one day as in twenty-one years. 2. In absence of opposing proof, long continued use by the public is evidence of an intent to dedicate, but it is not conclusive, and always yields to satisfactory contrary proof. 3. Where the owner of land, bordering on a public highway, sets his fence back from the highway for his own convenience, and uses the intervening space until his death, for private purposes, a bill for an injunction will not lie, by the municipal authorities, to restrain a subse quent owner of said property, fifteen years after the death of the former owner, from setting back the fence, and again including said intervening space within the same. 4. The testimony in this case held to warrant a finding of the above state of facts. 6. Semble. That in eases where the court below reversos a Master upon findings of fact, without reviewing the testimony, an opinion should be filed pointing out the errors of the Master in his treatment of the facts. February 26th, 1885. Before Mercur, C. J., Gordon, Paxson, Trunkey, Sterrett, Green and Clark, JJ. Appeal from the Court of Common Pleas of Lackawanna county: In Equity: Of January Term 1885, No. 287. Bill in equity, filed August 2d, 1875, between the city of Scranton, plaintiff, and D. W. Griffin, defendant, praying for an injunction to restrain the defendant from erecting a fence along the side of Main street, claimed by plaintiff to extend into, and be an obstruction to said street. The bill set out, that in the city of Scranton there was a street known as Main street which had been accepted and used as a public street or road for thirty years or more; that the fence on the easterly side had remained unchanged for a period of thirty years; that the defendant had begun the erection of a fence in front of his premises and along the line of said Main street, 15 feet in front of the former fence line, toward the centre of Main street, occupying the sidewalk and reducing the width of the street; by reason of which the street was made unsafe for travel, and the city rendered liable to suits for damages. The defendant’s answer denied that the fence at the point in dispute had been fixed and permanent as alleged in the bill; and averred that it had been frequently changed; that Judson Clark, a former owner, had thrown back the fence at said point which was in front of his dwelling, so as to make an unoccupied space there between the street and his house, where he could tie horses and leave wagons when not in use ; that the space so thrown open had not been dedicated to public use, and was the space now fenced in by the present owner of the Clark homestead, and finally that the defendant was not obstructing the street, but was building his fence upon the line established by the city authorities of Scranton. The cause was referred to M. J. Wilson, Esquire, as Master, who filed the following report: “In 1855 or 1856 Judson Clark became the owner of a farm, now in whole or in part within the limits of the city of Scranton. The Providence and Carbondale Plank Hoad passed over or across this farm. Soon after Mr. Clark purchased, he moved the road fence back on the side next his house, leaving an open space between the fence and the road bed, some twenty-five or thirty feet in width. This was done for the more convenient use of his property, to provide standing room for wagons, etc. This space was so used by Mr. Clark up to the time of his death in 1860. Mr. Clark left a will giving to his widow the dwelling house on the east side of the Providence and Carbondale Turnpike, with certain land on which it stood, bounded on the west by said 'road, and this is the property now owned b]r D. W. Griffin, the defendant. The defendant now seeks to take in all or a part of the land thrown out by Clark when he moved the road fence back, and by this bill the plaintiff seeks to restrain him from so doing. That part of the road is now in the First ward, and is known as Main street. It was graded and ditched, and sidewalks laid out in 1875 and 1876 by city officials and at city expense. I cannot find that Clark dedicated this strip of land to public use, or that he intended to do so; but from his acts I infer a contrary intent. Neither can I find that the fence erected or sought to be erected by the defendant is or will be an obstruction of this street. I am of opinion the defendant Iras the right to build his fence on the line where it used to be, where it was when Mr. Clark bought the farm, and I cannot say but that the fence being built is on or within that line. I would, therefore, advise that the injunction be dissolved and the bill be dismissed at the plaintiff’s cost.” The case was subsequently referred again to the Master to take further testimon}’. Numerous witnesses for the plaintiff testified that they had been familiar with the Clark property for thirty or forty years, and that they had never seen a fence in front of it “so far out in the street ” as the one started by the defendant; that there had been “no fence so far out for forty years” to their recollection; that said fence was in the road bed; that it was an obstruction to the road; that it “ stands in what was the road, and what has been the road for thirty years, so far as my recollection goes.”.....Witnesses for the defendant testified that Clark moved the fence back when he bought the property, and used the space thus made by the new fence for wagons, as previously reported by the Master. [The testimony of defendant’s witnesses is set out at length in the opinion of the Supreme Court.] The Master filed a second report by which he refused to change the former one, and recommended that the plaintiff’s bill be dismissed. The plaintiff filed, inter alia, the following exception:— “Fourth. Because the Master erred in deciding that a twenty-one year user on the part of the public, was not an absolute dedication to public use, rendering the erection of any obstruction thereto, ground for the granting of an injunction.” The court, Handley, P. J., filed the following opinion: “We filed an opinion on December 29th, 1875, continuing the injunction granted in this case. The Master now reports adversely to the plaintiff, whereupon she filed exceptions. “We have made a careful examination of the evidence, the report and exceptions. We cannot agree with the Master, and hence sustain the plaintiff’s fourth exception, and order and direct the injunction heretofore granted to be made perpetual against the defendant.” The defendant thereupon took this appeal, assigning for error, the decree of the court making the injunction perpetual, and imposing the costs on the defendant. H. M. Hannah, for appellant. The Master finds that there was no dedication at all of the strip of land between the foot path used by the public along the defendant’s fence and the real road bed, which was some twenty-five or thirty feet from this fence. He finds as a matter of fact that “ Judson Clark moved his fences back on the side next his house, leaving an open space between the fence and the road bed some twenty-five or thirty feet in width. This was done for the more convenient use of his property, to provide standing room for his wagons, etc. This space was so used by Mr. Clark up to the time of his death in 1860.” There was no evidence offered by the plaintiff which directly contradicted this. The Master then only finds as a fact what the witnesses had positively sworn to. What he found upon this point was not only supported by the weight of the testimony, but was supported by all the direct testimony in the case relating to this particular question. The weight to be given to a Master’s finding of facts is fully explained’in Sproull’s App., 71 Pa. St., 137; Hindman’s App., 85 Id., 467; Burton’s App., 93 Id., 214; Wiutou v. Mott, 4 Luz. Leg. Reg., 71. I. H. Burns and E. B. Sturges, for appellee. In view of the testimony before the Master, the burden of proof was on the defendant below to overthrow the presumption of dedication. But the Master put the whole burden of showing a dedication on the plaintiff, in which plaintiff undoubtedly succeeded. “ It is not necessary to a dedication, that there shall have been twenty-one years of adverse enjoyment: ” Schenley ¶.

Instructions to the Jury.—If the plaintiff is not entitled to recover upon his own showing, the appellate Court, on his appeal, will not pass on the correctness of the instructions given by the Court to the jury. Pence on Line of Railroad.—The Act of 1861, requiring railroad companies to maintain a sufficient fence on both sides of their property, without prescribing what a sufficient fence shall be, must be considered as referring to and adopting the general law fixing the standard of lawful fences. Injuries to Cattle by Railroad.—If an insufficient barway is placed, by a railroad company, in a fence on the line of its road, at the request of and for the use of the owner of adjoining land, and he uses the same,\" and does not complain of its insufficiency, or notify the company to alter it, the company is not liable for damages for injuries to his cattle happening in consequence of the bar-way being too low to turn cattle. Pence on Line of Railroad.—The provisions of the law requiring railroad companies to build fences on the lines of their roads, are designed for the protection of adjoining owners, and such provisions may be waived by them. Evidence of Experts.—The opinion of experts is not admissible on the question of the sufficiency of a fence to turn cattle. Evidence in Pence Case.—If the plaintiff introduces evidence to show that he contracted with a railroad company as to the kind of fence to be built, he is precluded from introducing evidence as to the statutory character of the fence. Appeal from the District Court, Third Judicial District, Santa Clara County. The facts are stated in the opinion of the Court. Moore & Laine, for Appellant, argued: That the verdict was against the evidence, because a statutory fence had not been kept up by defendant, and that the Court erred in not allowing the testimony of experts; and on the last point cited 4 Barb. 625; 11 Cushing, 257; and 1 Smith\\'s Leading Cases, 630. They also argued that the words good and sufficient fence,” in the Bailroad Act of 1861, did not refer to and were not governed by \"the fence law of 1855. That the latter was merely intended to protect crops, while the former referred to a dangerous business—that of railroading; and that a “ good and sufficient fence ” to protect a crop would not be such fence if built by the side of a railroad. C. T. Ryland, for Respondent. The general rule is, that the opinions of witnesses are not evidence. (1 Green. Ev., Sec. 440; Morehouse v. Mathews, 2 Coms. 514; Harger v. Edmond, 4 Barb. 256.) If the plaintiff seeks to overthrow this general rule he must bring himself clearly within the exceptions. (Best Prin. Ev., par. 344.) The opinion of the witness was sought upon one of the most common and ordinary subjects, and not upon a question of skill or science. The opinions of the witness upon such questions might be as various and as fickle as the mind of man. There is nothing to guide the opinions of witnesses but fancy, and the diversity would be endless. The following cases, in addition to the authorities already cited, wall be found to bear on the question: Paige v. Hazard et al., 5 Hill, 603; Dunham v. Simmons, 3 Hill, 609; Newman v. Wells, 17 Wend. 136; 13 Wend. 81; 24 Wend. 668; Folks v. Chadd, 3 Doug. 157, is a leading case; 9 Bing. 335. The laiv is ably and clearly reviewed in 17 Wend. 161, and the true rule stated. We would ask its examination. Exceptions to the general rule should not be rashly multiplied. While respondent admits that, under section forty of the Bailroad Act, it was the duty of the company to make and maintain good and sufficient fences, we contend that that duty may be waived, and if it is waived, the party waiving cannot complain^ Section forty itself provides for a waiver, and shows that the responsibility may be shifted. On this question I would - simply ask: Why is it that there can be no waiver ? Why is it that the party who complains may not have the power to waive his right ? Why may not he by his act shift the responsibility from the shoulders of the railroad company to his own, as he could do in other cases ? Pierce, in his work on American, Railways, (p. 344,) undér the head of “ Waivers,” says: “ That the provisions of a statute requiring the company to maintain fences on the sides of its tracks, which is to be interpreted as designed for the protection of the adjoining owner, may be waived by him, or the duty assumed by himself.” He further says, that the effect of such waiver is to exonerate the “ company from liability for injuries to his cattle in consequence of the fence not being constructed according to the requirement of the statute.” It would appear from this author, whose work has been cited and approved by this Court, that the provisions of the statute may be waived, and that such waiver not only shifts the responsibility, but exonerates the company from liability to such land owner when his stock is injured. To the same effect is the doctrine laid down by Redfield on Railroads, p. 873. It is decided in 8 Poster, \\'161, that the responsibility may be shifted. The same doctrines may be found in 25 Vt. 116, 150; 27 Vt. 49; 18 Barb., N. Y., 583. Moore & Laine, in Reply, argued that as the Railroad Act provided that “ In any case where the railroad company have heretofore or may hereafter pay to the owner or owners of the land through which or alongside of which their road is or may be located, an agreed price for making and maintaining such fence, or whenever the cost of such fence has been or may be included in the award of damages allowed and paid for the right of way for such railroad, such company, shall be entirely relieved and exonerated from all claims or awards of damages arising out of the killing or maiming any animals as aforesaid in favor of all persons or their successors or assigns who shall thus fail to construct and maintain such fence.” That a railroad company could not avoid the responsibility of building a fence in any other than the statutory mode.',\n",

       "  'case_summary': \"George v. Kern, Appellant. Deeds — Boundaries—Fence—Evidence. 1. In an action of trespass where the issue was whether an old fence marked the boundary line between the properties of plaintiff and defendant, the deeds of both parties and surveys made therefrom with the maps and plots are competent evidence when followed by testimony showing the fence to be on the dividing line, inasmuch as they would show recognition and acceptance by the prior owners. 2. In the effort to establish the disputed line between the plaintiff’s and the defendant’s land, as being identified with the fence line and the fence line with it, the fence and the line’s existence as such in its entirety from the time it was first known or exhibited by records, may be shown. It is immaterial that in later years the line was cut up in sections forming boundaries between different owners, and it does not matter, if the disputed section in question conforms in all general requirements to the original line as mentioned in the several deeds forming the chain of title. If slight variations exist their effect unexplained will be for the jury. 3. On the trial of such an issue where the existence of a particular corner is evidenced not only from the calls in the defendant’s and his predecessor’s deeds and the surveys therefrom, but from the testimony of witnesses who knew that it had been there as an established corner for a long period of time, the court is not in error in charging that the .recognition of this point on the part of' the grantors and grantees in the deeds had a material bearing on the location of the fence as testified to by the surveyors. 4. The court cannot be convicted of error in stating to the jury that ■ a line ran by the defendant’s surveyor could not be of much assistance . to them, if it appears that the line was not made from any call in a deed, nor with reference to the location of any old fence,'nor made upon a course and distance given by any authenticated record between two established corners. Argued Dec. 15, 1914. Appeal, No. 264, Oct. T., 1914, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. Carbon Co., Jan. T., 1913, No. 32, on verdict for plaintiff in case of Charles George v. Osville P. Kern. Before Rice, P. J., Orlady, Head, Kephart and Trexler, JJ. Affirmed. Trespass in the nature of a quare clausum fregit. Before Barber, J. At the trial it appeared that the plaintiff and defendant and their predecessors in title had maintained a fence between them for a distance of thirty rods for forty years or more. The parties agreed to a rebuilding of the fence, but the defendant built a new fence not on the line of the old fenced but over on what the plaintiff claimed was his land. The court admitted under objection and exception ■ the deeds of plaintiff and his predecessors in title with surveys, maps and plots made therefrom. [1] T. B. Craig, a witness for plaintiff, was asked this question: “Q. Did you survey the southwest corner of the Thomas Craig tract? A. Yes. Q. And the southwest corner of the Kern tract? A. Yes. Q. Have you seen Mr. Kern’s deed? A. Yes. Q. What was the distance called for in his deed?” Mr. Sitler: Defendant objects for the reason that the line below the road would not control the line above the road. The Court: You mean south of the road. Mr. Sitler: The line south of the road would not control the line north of the road, and only the line north of the road is in dispute. Mr. Freyman: In reply would say, under the pleadings we claim title to an acre of ground which is described in plaintiff’s statement, and the boundary line must be fixed between the southwest corner of the defendant’s property and the northeast corner of the George property, and that boundary line cannot be fixed by running a part of the distance of that line and can only be fixed by running a line from one corner to the other. Mr. Sitler: The plaintiff has made it a broken line above and below the road. The Court: There has been some evidence of a broken line, but the original surveys and the draft offered in evidence with the patents, as well as the deeds, show a straight line between the properties on the north and south of the road. It will be for the jury to determine what effect that offset will have. For the purpose of showing where the original line is, it will be necessary to have this point at the extreme corners. As a basis of any evidence bearing on that it would be evidence. Objection overruled. Exception. [2] “Q. What do you find the distance? A. Thirty-five perches.” Plaintiff’s witness, A. A. Ziegenfus, being on the stand, testifying in chief, was asked! “Q. You know the division fence between the Kern property on the east and the other three properties on the west? A. Yes. Q. How long have you known this division fence? A. I have known this division fence for the last thirty or thirty-five years.” Mr. Sitler: I ask that that be stricken out. Object that the question embodies what is not a fact in the case. North of the road the fence was between Kern and one adjoining property owner. Below it was between Kern and another property owner, acquiring title from a different source. The question that is put in the witness’' mouth, so to speak, is a question of that line fence between Kern and naming other property owners col lectively, thus embodying in the question what is not legitimate, the fence between Kern and one property owner being an entirely different fence from the one below the road. I do not think they have the right to embody that in a single question answerable by “Yes.” The Court: While it is true that the question at issue is the location of a divisional line between the plaintiff and the defendant on the north side of the road, yet during the entire progress of the case, evidence has been admitted showing the line from the south end of the Kern and Ziegenfus properties on Stony Ridge to a point on the north end'of the division line of the properties of Kern and George. That part of the line on the south of the road has been constantly referred to in the drafts, courses and distances, and the testimony of witnesses as bearing upon the contention of the plaintiff that it is a straight line from the Stony Ridge corner to the north end, and as bearing upon the location of the fence — where that fence actually was. Objection overruled and bill sealed for defendant. The motion to strike out is denied. [3] “Q. What kind of a fence was that, Squire? A. It was an old rail fence. ... Q. I now ask this witness the same question asked this morning of Mr. Craig. I know the court has ruled, but I press the question, and will assign an additional reason, for the sake of showing the interest of the witness as well as of Mr. Craig. I ask this witness whether Craig and Ziegenfus have not had Mr. Kern notified, through Mr. Freyman, to remove that fence which was built in pursuance of agreement between Kern and Ziegenfus?” Objected to as immaterial. The Court: That might be some argument to a jury if you were supported by evidence; but as a legal proposition, they both admit notice of this alleged agreement between Ziegenfus and Kern. If they bought with notice of that agreement they would not be in a very good legal position to demand anything more.. Assume they are endeavoring to acquire more property, that would be simply a matter of showing their interest in the controversy, and that would be legitimate argument to a jury because they owned adjoining property, but as affecting this plaintiff I cannot see how any agreement of that kind or any notice would affect this plaintiff, or how it has any bearing on the case. Objection sustained and bill sealed. [5] Plaintiff presented these points: ■ 8. In the deed from Christopher Kern and wife to Levi Kern, dated May 27, 1837, the southwest corner of . the property therein conveyed, now owned by Mr. Kern, the defendant, would appear to be thirty-eight perches west from the southeast corner of the Thomas Craig property, now owned by Teel and Kern, as shown by the connected draft made by Thomas B. Craig in evidence, and in the deed from Charles Mendsen, assignee of Levi Kern to Stephen Kern, dated October 1, 1878, the distance between the same corner, is thirty-five perches; also in the deed from Sarah Kern and Stephen E. Kern, administrators of Stephen Kern, deceased, to Osville P., Kern, the defendant, dated April 1, 1882, the distance given between the same comers is thirty-five perches. The distance of thirty-five perches given in the two deeds last stated would be an admission or recognition on the part of the grantors and grantees in said deeds that the correct distance between said corners is only thirty-five perches, which would agree with the location of the old division' fence as located and testified to by all the surveyors. • Answer: Affirmed. [7] The court charged in part as follows: [Considering the red and ■ the dotted line from the stone comer at the “Chestnut Stump” marked letter “C,” and also the green line marked “D,” — I think the testimony is they ran that line from the north. In reference to these lines the court feels obliged to say to you that neither the red line nor the green line can be of much assistance to you. Starting some seven or eight feet over on the hill north of the road from what defendant terms his north corner, they sighted over to where the old chestnut corner was. i Now the difficulty with that sort of a line' is that as the surveyor sighted it across there, he would run just where he pointed his instrument. If the instrument would be in the correct place, the' line would be correct. But the south corner,. as I told you, is not called for in defendant’s deed, nor in the deed of any of his predecessors, except that of Levi Kern, who never took possession thereof. So that thirty-eight perch comer can have little bearing in this case. If they want to run the line from the corner they would have to run it south twenty-two and three-fourths degrees east, which would bring it about forty feet west of the Kern line all the way over. The red line is simply a sight line, and is not run by courses and distances and not from any established corner. The surveyor simply set up his instrument and ran his line from where the defendant claims this north corner to be — this thirty-eight perch corner. I have given you the view of the court in relation to this thirty-eight perch corner.] [8] [The green line represents the line running from that thirty-five perch corner. The difficulty is that he does not start from any established corner. He starts up at the north where they claim a corner and trees, and runs south. It is all important when you run lines that you start from an established corner, and then run the proper courses and distances given in the lines. It seems this dotted line is the only line to which consideration could be given which would be of assistance to you in this large tract.] [9] [Then you come to the dotted line which was started from the thirty-eight perch corner and ran across to the post and that was intended to be, so far as the south side of the road is concerned, to be the dividing line of this tract, which Eugene Ziegenftis agreed that Mr. Kern should have, and that dotted line was to lie where the fence was to be put. Although stakes were put up they did not call this conclusive as to the northern boundary.] [10] May 14, 1915: [Defendant says at one time in his testimony that he did not know of any corner at the north end. He took the corner at the north where he made a mark on the rails of the fence running east and west. This is the evidence as to how he established that corner. Therefore the dotted lines represent his claim and is to be considered so far as supported by the evidence, as being the end of the brush fence on the south and the fence on the north.] [11] [You will remember what the defendant said about the rails of the old fence coming down to the road and resting on the rails going up from the east just below the old post. . . Mr. Costenbader said the rails of the fence on that side did not strike the post of my fence extending to the little cherry tree.] [12] Verdict and' judgment for plaintiff. Defendant appealed.

Jones Monaghan, Esq., whose findings of facts and conclusions of law were substantially as follows: The facts, as I understand the contention, are these: By deed dated June 14th, 1813, Robert Lamborn and wife, “in consideration of the yearly payment of one grain of wheat when lawfully demanded by the said Robert Lamborn or his heirs,” granted, bargained, sold and confirmed, with a covenant for further assurances, to William Chambers and others, “and to the survivor or survivors of them, and the assigns of such survivor or survivors forever,” a tract of three acres of land in the then village, now borough, of Kennett Square, “ excepting the privilege of a road twenty feet wide adjoining John Taylor’s line along the west side of the above described tract, for the said Robert Lamborn, his heirs and assigns\\', to pass and re-pass at all times.” There is no trust, expressed on the face of the deed, in the grantees therein named, but I am given to understand that they were a committee of a meeting of the Society of Friends, and that this is the usual method in that religious body for the ■holding of titles to real estate used for the purposes of their Society. This tract has ever since been used as a meetinghouse ground, and there are erected thereon the usual buildings and improvements. \\' It is fair to assume, too, though nothing on the subject appears in the evidence, that the burial ground is on the same lot. Samuel Martin, the respondents’ testator, was an active member of the Kennett Square Meeting of Friends. He was a regular attendant of the meetings of that Society, and an approved minister therein. He died June 17th, 1880, at an advanced age, possessed of an estate estimated to exceed $70,000, and leaving to survive him only collateral heirs. By his last will, dated March 15th, 1878, he devised a lot adjoining the meeting-house grounds, on which he had erected an academy building, together with a considerable sum of money, to the Kennett Monthly Meeting of Friends, for the maintenance of an academy or school, known as the Martin. Academy. The three lots, the meeting-house grounds, the Martin Academy property and the burial grounds, adjoin, as appears by the draft returned herewith, the meeting-house grounds and the school lot fronting on what is known as State street, and the cemetery lot lying partially iii the rear of both the other lots. By a codicil to his will, bearing date March 8th, 1880, Samuel Martin directed as follows: “I, Samuel Martin, of Kennett Square borough, have for a considerable time desired, and it is my wish, that my executors named in my last will and testament, shall at a proper time within one year \\'after mj^ death, inclose with a good and substantial iron fence (somewhat like the one around the cemetery at Unionville), the Friends’ Meeting-house grounds, as also the school-house grounds attached, and the Friends’ burial ground, all expenses incurred to be paid from the proceeds of my estate.” Samuel Martin had some time before his death commenced the erection of this iron fence, and it was in process of construction at the time of his death. Sharpless Mercer, one of his executors, then acting under a letter of attorney, had erected or contracted for the erection of so much of the fence as extended along State street, in front of both the meeting\\'house and school-house lots. The bill therefor of $444.60 was allowed, after exceptions, in the distribution of Samuel Martin’s, estate. The settlement of that estate seems to have been closely scrutinized by the residuary legatees, who appear to’ have endeavored to keep all expenditures within as narrow bounds as was properly possible. A question seems to have, early arisen about the matters contained in this codicil (1), as to the bill for fencing already incurred (2), as to whether each of the three lots should be fenced separately, or a common fence around the whole as one, and (3) as to the amount of money necessary to be expended in building the fence.\\' The executors endeavored to agree with the residuary legatees as to the amount needed. Failing in that they filed their first account on July 7th, 1881, in which they claimed credit for the $444.60, the bill already incurred, and for $1,600 reserved wherewith to finish the fence. Exception was taken by the residuary legatees to these credits, among others, and on August 8th, 1881, the Orphans’ Court appointed Geo. M. Rupert, Esq., Auditor, to consider and report upon said exceptions. The Auditor met on September 21st, September 28th and October 7th, 1881, and on November 21st, 1881, filed his report, which, after exception, was confirmed absolutely by the court, on January 3d, 1882. By his report, the Auditor approved the credit of $444.60, for fence already built, and allowed for a division of fence between the three lots, but reported that the remainder of the fence could be built for $1,350, and reduced the credit of $1,500 to that amount. • The first account of the executors, to which these exceptions were filed, showed a balance remaining in their hands of $31,306.29. On January 3d, 1882, Mr. Rupert was appointed by the Orphans’ Court, Auditor, to make distribution of this balance, as corrected and ascertained by the confirmation of his report on the exceptions, and on March 15th, 1882, his report, distributing this balance among the legatees, a considerable amount being distributed pro rata amongst the residuary legatees, was absolutely confirmed by the court. On June 29th, 1882, the executors filed a supplemental account, which showed a balance in their hands of $348.60. This balance was by them distributed among the residuary-legatees without\" a decree of distribution by the Orphans’ Court, or an Auditor, and a refunding boird Avas taken by the executors from the legatees. This bond was not submitted to the Orphans’ Court for approval, but was a matter of private agreement between the executors and residuary legatees. It refers only to the balance of $348.60 appearing by the supplemental account, and does not relate to the balance shown by the first account, which was distributed by the decree of the Orphans’ Court. It appears that the control of the meeting-house grounds and the cemetery is vested in what is called the Kennett Square Preparative Meeting of Friends, and the control of the school property adjoining is in the Kennett Monthly Meeting. Both of these bodies are unincorporated associations for religious worship. The Preparative Meeting is identical with the Kennett Square Meeting of Friends, which meets at this meeting-house twice a week for worship. The Kennett Monthly Meeting is a superior ecclesiastical organization, composed of three preparative meetings, the Kennett Square Preparative Meeting, the Kennett Preparative Meeting and the Marlborough Preparative Meeting. It meets alternately at the local meeting-houses of the subordinate bodies. The Monthly Meeting had the title to the school property, and had received, under Samuel Martin’s will, certain other bequests toward maintaining said school. The codicil to Samuel Martin’s will, which is involved in this contention, was not probated b}? the executors at the time of proving the will, but was admitted to probate after a citation issued at the complaint of Evan T. Swayne, one of the plaintiffs here. On August 3d, 1880, the Monthly Meeting appointed a committee of fourteen “ as trustees to have charge of the property and fund donated by the late Samuel Martin, to Kennett Monthly Meeting of Friends, and to assume such other responsibilities incurred thereby, as designated in his will.” That committee employed Washington Townsend, Esq., to represent them. The first question about which Mr. Townsend was consulted was in regard to some bank stock which Samuel Martin had bequeathed to the Monthly Meeting, but afterwards, before his death, had disposed of. Later, the codicil was presented to him for his opinion, and by him procured to be admitted to probate. When the exceptions Avere filed to the executors’ account, Mr. Townsend appeared before the Auditor as counsel for the Kennett Monthly Meeting. He looked after, however, all matters which arose before the Auditor in regard to the codicil, and that were involved in the erection of the iron fence. Although employed and paid by the Monthly Meeting, and although technically representing no one else, neither he nor any of the parties in interest understood at the time that there was any distinction between the Preparative Meeting and the Monthly Meeting in the matters involved before the Auditor. At the same time it is clear that the committee of the Preparative Meeting did not officially employ Mr. Townsend, nor did they officially undertake any part of the proceedings before Mr. Rupert. The committee of the Preparative Meeting was appointed July 29th, 1880. It .consisted of Hiram Hall, John Lamborn, Samuel Chandler and Evan T. S wayne, the four plaintiffs in this bill. Mr. Swayne is also a member of the Monthly Meeting committee, and was one of its number who corresponded and consulted with Mr. Townsend. The dutjr of the committee, as appears b)\\'- the minute of its appointment, was “to inquire into the interest of this meeting relative to Samuel Martin’s bequest pertaining to an iron fence inclosing our grounds ; to see that such fence be erected in a suitable manner; to erect good and substantial granite posts at the gateway, and to perform such other duties as may be incumbent thereto.” The matters contested before Mr. Rupert in regard to this fence; were three; 1st, the propriety of allowing the credit for $440:60, the bill incurred before Mr. Martin’s death; and 2d, whether a proper construction of the will required a division fence between the three lots, as well as the outside fence; and 3d, whether that fence could be erected for a less sum than the $1,600 reserved for that purpose. It appears by the evidence before me that on the western side of the meetinghouse lot are erected certain frame sheds, which stand on a stone foundation, and are used by the horses and vehicles of those who attend the meeting. These sheds extend almost the entire length of the western side\\'of the lot, being within thirteen feet of the southern line, and within twenty-six feet of the northern, or State street, line. They are not located on the western line of the lot, as described in the deed from Robert Lamborn, but are twenty-seven feet east thereof, at the northern end, and about forty feet to the east at the southern end. There is nothing on the ground at present to indicate to the casual observer that this strip of land west of the sheds belongs to the meeting-house lot. It.lies in the rear of an adjoining lot of Henry G. White, and is used by him with his own lot for storing lumber and rubbish. At the same time it is clear that Samuel Martin, in his life-time, knew where the boundary line was. This strip, however,-is subject to the privilege of a road twenty feet wide reserved in the deed of Robert Lamborn. The dominant property entitled to the use of said road, which belonged in 1813 to Robert Lamborn, is now, I understand, the lot of Henry G. White, which adjoins the meeting-house lot on the south. • I find as a fact, subject to the competency of the proof which is hereafter discussed, that Samuel Martin, although he knew where the actual line described in the deed was, did not intend to erect a fence on the western line back of the sheds, but intended to connect the iron fence which he was building, and which, by his codicil, he directed to be constructed, with the ends of the sheds. At the same time, it is clear that Mr. Rupert did not assume to construe the will on this point, nor to pass upon the question as a disputed matter. Mr. Barnard, who represented the residuary legatees, seems to have raised the question, but no one seems to have doubted that his position was sound. It was apparently conceded by Mr. Townsend, and all who were present before the Auditor, that there was no occasion for a fence on the western line, and no question whatever was made on the subject. The draft attached to the testimony returned with Mr. Rupert’s report, and the measurements and additions thereof on tíre same, show beyond a doubt that there was no thought by those there present of the erection of a fence on the western line. • Hiram Hall, one of the plaintiffs, was called as a witness before Mr. Rupert and testified as to the character of the fence, and seems, to have been asked in regard to the cost of the same. Evan T. Swayne was an active member of the committee of the Monthly Meeting, and conferred with Mr. Townsend in regard to the same matter. Both of them must have known that the inquiry was depending. It would be difficult, after this lapse of time, either for them, or others, to recollect, or for me to properly infer, how full and precise was their knowledge of the question then being considered. Nor do I deem it important, for enough is shown to have put then on inquiry.: There is no evidence to show that John Lamborn or Samuel Chandler, the other two plaintiffs, had at the time knowledge of the inquiry pending, though it would be a violent presump-\\' tion to suppose that they knew nothing of it. I see nothing, in the evidence, however, to justify me in supposing that any of the plaintiffs raised before Mr. Rupert the question involved before me, nor that they had actual knowledge that it was being passed upon. Indeed, I am impressed that at that time the question now raised had not occurred to them, or to any one else interested in Samuel Martin’s estate. After Mr. Rupert’s report, allowing |1,350 for the erection of the iron fence, was confirmed by the court, the executors proceeded to erect the same. They have built the division fences between the three lots, and the outside fence on three sides of the meeting-house grounds. They have not, as yet, however, connected the same with the sheds, so that thirty- ■ nine feet y\\'et remains to be built for that purpose. All of the $1,350 has been expended, except $33.30, which remains in their hands, with which it is their intention to connect the fence already constructed, with the ends of the sheds. Except this $33.30, they have none of the estate of Samuel Martin remaining-in their hands. In the fall of 1882, the executors had built the fence where it now is, and had stopped work. The next Spring they were called upon by the committee, and required to build the fence on the west line back of the sheds. Whether they refused peremptoiffy, or explained the situation in which they were, is not very clear. They say they informed the committee that all the money was expended, except the little balance in their hands, and the committee say they simply refused to go on. Hiram Hall, however, admits a conversation with Solomon Mercer on this subject. Both sides seem to me to have been rather abrupt in this matter, and to have shown little disposition toward conciliation. With a little concession, and less pride of opinion, there need have been no serious dispute on this point. Indeed, it seems to me that the case was an excellent one to have been settled at home, and that by calling in the residuary legatees, the real parties in interest, the dispute might easily have been adjusted among themselves. However, the executors, declining to build this fence out of their own moneys, the present bill was filed to compel them to build it in accordance with the views of the plaintiffs, — Tiinc illae lacrymae ! I do not care to put the decision of this case on the ground suggested by Mr. Pinkerton, that the plaintiffs are mere volunteers. It is undoubtedly true that the real party in interest is the Preparative Meeting itself, and that the plaintiffs were appointed a committee by the meeting after the rights of the meeting had fully vested. Probably it would have been better to have described the plaintiffs as suing in their own right, and on behalf of the other members of the meeting of which they are also members. Equity, however, looks rather to the substance, and we may well, under all the facts, dispose of the case, as if the amendment had been made. In my judgment the case resolves itself into three questions of law: (1.) Is there a latent ambiguity in the codicil to Samuel Martin’s will? (2.) Has this court jurisdiction of the complaint? (3.) Has this contention been concluded by the judgment of the Orphans’ Court? In my opinion all of these questions must be resolved against the complainants. I recommend a decree dismissing the complaint at the cost • of the complainants. Exceptions were filed to this report by the plaintiffs. These were dismissed, and the decree recommended by the trustee entered. The plaintiffs thereupon took this appeal assigning for error, inter alia, the entering of the decree dismissing their bill. Wm. M. Hayes, for the appellants. 1. There is no latent ambiguity in the codicil to Samuel Martin’s will. That verbal testimony may not be received to contradict or vary a plain direction in a will, is consonant with reason and authority. Mr. Justice Trunkey, in delivering the opinion of this court in Porter’s Appeal, May 17th, 1880, says: “Parol evidence-to show what were the actual testamentary intentions, such as his declarations of what he had done or1 meant to do, is inadmissible, but it is competent to determine which of several persons or things was intended under\\' an equivocal description.” 13 Norris, 336. “ The legal construction of a will in writing cannot be explained or altered by the parol declarations of the testator, of his understanding of the meaning of the will, or of his intentions to do something else”: Sergeant, J., Comfort v. Mather, 2 W. & S., 453. “ Our law requires that wills should be in writing, and proved by two witnesses. But if the writing is to be contradicted by parol evidence, the object of the law will be defeated, and all certainty destroyed......The rule of law, therefore, is that the writing is not to be altered or explained by-evidence aliunde”: TILGHMAN, C. J., Iddings v. Iddings, 7 S. & R., 113. “A will which contains no intelligible devise or bequest, is void for uncertainty; parol evidence is not admissible to explain what the testator meant by such an instrument”: Woodward, J., Kelley v. Kelley, 1 Casey, 460. Parol evidence as to mistakes in a will held to be inadmissible, and elaborately discussed by Read, J., in the case of Wallize v. Wallize, 5 P. F. S., 242. 2. This court has jurisdiction of the matter. This question, we think, is set at rest by the case of the Fidelity Trust Company’s Appeal, 11 W. N. C.. 264, where, in a case of similar\\' character, the question was raised and the jurisdiction of a Court of Equity sustained, the court, inter alia, saying, “that\\' this is a proper case for determination by a proceeding in equity is unquestioned.” See, also, Swinney et al. v. Fidelity Insurance, Trust and Safe Deposit Company, 10 W. N. C., 290. 3. The contention has not been concluded by the decree of the Orphans’ Court. It is very doubtful whether the Orphans’ Court in any event, would have been the proper tribunal; and even if the Preparative Meeting, or its committee, had received notice of the audit before Mr. Rupert, and had appeared before him, it is very questionable whether he, as an Auditor appointed by the Orphans’ Court, to pass upon exceptions to an account, could have assumed jurisdiction of this fence question. The complainants here are neither creditors, legatees, nor distributees, and only such classes of persons can make claim in a proceeding for distribution in the Orphans’ Court: Bra-man’s Appeal, 8 Norris, 78; McBride’s Appeal, 22 P. F. S., 480. The Orphans’ Court does not have general equity powers. “It cannot entertain a bill of discovery ”: Brinker v. Blinker, 7 Barr, 55. “Waste is not a subject matter of inquiry of which the Orphans’ Court can take cognizance: Crowell’s Appeal, 2 Watts, 295. “The Orphans’ Court has not general equity jurisdiction, and under equity rules is not enabled, when once possessed of a cause, to make an end of the controversy”: Ake & Feay’s Appeal, 24 P. F. S., 116. The language of Mr. Justice Trunkey, in Fidelity Trust Company’s Appeal, is exceedingly applicable to this case: “ That this is a proper ease for determination by a proceeding in equity is unquestioned. The bill is not to compel the distribution of the testator’s estate, but to establish the right of the” Ken nett Square Preparative Meeting under the codicil to the will. “ This right being established, the decree” ought to accord “ with the provisions of the” codicil. “ Its enforcement will be governed by similar principles as are prescribed in the statute providing for the recovery of legacies in the common law courts.” John J. Pinkerton, for appellees. Will the Court of Common Pleas assume jurisdiction in this case ? It can scarcely be doubted that the provision in the codicil of .Samuel Martin’s wiR for the erection of a fence is a legacy to the Friends’ Meeting at Kennett Square. If this is so the Orphans’ Court had full and complete jurisdiction o.f the question of its cost and erection. This court has said:— It is very clear that the Orphans’ Court in a proceeding to distribute an estate among legatees, next of kin and heirs, has ample power to inquire into and determine all questions standing directly in the way of distribution to these parties: Dundas’s Estate, 23 Smith, 480. Within its appointed orbit the jurisdiction -of the Orphans’ Court is exclusive, and therefore necessarily as extensive as the demands of justice: Shollenberger’s Appeal, 9 Harris, 341. If there is anything besides death which is not to be doubted, it is that the Orphans’ Court alone has authority to ascertain the amount of a decedent’s property and order its distribution among those entitled to it: Whiteside v. Whiteside, 8.Harris. 474; Ashford v. Ewing, 1 Casey, 213 ; Kellera’s Estate, 5 Harris, 422; Dundas’s Estate, 23 P. F. S., 474; Hammett’s Appeal, 2 Norris, 392; Head v. Meloney, 17 W. N. C., 88.',\n",

Injunctions — restrictive covenant in deed as to use of premises — acquiescence of plaintiff in defendant’s violation of covenant while a tenant. Where a conveyance is made “ subject to the covenants in former deeds, also subject to the provisions of zone restrictions affecting said property,” the grantee is estopped from asserting that the property was conveyed to him free of any restrictions which existed with reference thereto at the date of the conveyance to him; he cannot claim its benefits and reject its burdens. A restrictive covenant in a deed, running with the land, against the use of the property except for the purpose of a private residence, is violated by the grantee using the property exclusively for the business of a private school; such use also violates a further covenant in the deed against permitting any trade or business from being carried on upon any portion of the premises. But, where plaintiff and defendant are the owners of contiguous properties deriving their title from the same common owner under deeds containing restrictive covenants above mentioned, and, in an action to enforce by injunction such covenants, it appears that before defendant purchased his property he had been a tenant thereof for three years and during that period had conducted a school thereon for private pupils under similar conditions to those now complained of, and it further appears that neither plaintiff’s wife, his predecessor in title, nor he by their conduct or statements indicated any opposition to the opening and the maintenance of the school by defendant as tenant of the building, nor had during such tenancy taken any steps to enforce the covenant, defendant was justified in assuming that at least they did not regard his use of the property for a school as a violation of their rights, and having in such circumstances changed his relation to the property from that of lessee to owner, and paid a substantial price therefor, he will be granted judgment upon the merits for the dismissal of the complaint on the ground that it would be inequitable to prevent his continued use of his property as a school.

Contributory Negligence: turning mule loose with knowledge of dangerous fenoe : jury question. Plaintiff with knowledge of the dangerous condition of defendant’s fence turned his mule loose to follow him along the highway. Held, it was not such an act as the judgment of all sensible men would condemn, and a court cannot as a matter of law declare it negligent, and it is, therefore, a question for the jury. 5. Negligence: use of highway with knowledge of defects. No one is precluded from the highway by his knowledge of its defects, but such knowledge-must be considered \"in passing on his care which must increase in proportion to his knowledge of the risk. Appeal from the Holt Circuit Court. — Hon. Cxrtjs A. Anthony, Judge. Reversed and remanded. L. JR. Knowles, for appellant. . (1) The court erred in refusing to give defendant’s instruction in the nature of a demurrer to plaintiff’s evidence for the reason that the plaintiff’s testimony clearly established the fact that he was guilty of culpable and gross carelessness, which was the direct cause of the injury, and further that he acknowledged the same at the time of the accident. Boland v. Kansas City, 32 Mo. App. 8; O’ Donald v. Railroad, 7 Mo. App. 190; 86 Mo. 104, and authorities cited. (2) Even if it be conceded that the fence was constructed in a negligent manner and was not a lawful, statutory fence, yet, unless such negligence in the construction of the fence was the cause of the injury, the plaintiff cannot recover. Stone-man v. Railroad, 58 Mo. 503 ; 62 Mo.\\' 562; 65 Mo. 22; 3 Mo. 375 and 300 ; 63 Mo. 417. Now if plaintiff’s mule had come in contact with a lawful, statutory fence, that is, such a fence as the law declares to be a lawful barbed wire fence, would not the same result have followed? (3) The court told the jury in the first or principal instruction given for plaintiff, in effect, that if the fence was anything less than a legal fence under the law in every particular (Session Acts of 1887, p. 194) then the defendant had no right or authority to build such a fence, and he was liable, or in other words such a fence was per se a nuisance. The absurdity of this proposition is too plain for comment. Further, this instruction failed to tell the jury that they must find that the injury occurred from the improper erection of the fence, or careless or negligent construction of the fence, and this question was not submitted to the jury at all, which is reversible error. Brown v. Road Co., 89 Mo. 152; Shearman & Redfield on Neg. [8 Ed.] sec. 421; Mathiason v. Mayer, 90 Mo. 585. (4) In the first instruction asked by the defendant, and refused by the court, the jury are told that the defendant had a right to erect a two-wire fence along the road at any height, provided the same was erected in a reasonable manner. This, according to our understanding, is nothing more or less than the law, and in order to guard the jury against the error of believing because the fence was composed of only two wires and was less than four feet in height, it was, therefore, an unlawful fence, and a nuisance, and the defendant must necessarily be liable. T. C. Duncan, for respondent. (1) The court did not err in refusing to give defendant’s instruction asked, in nature of demurrer to evidence, but properly refused the same. The evidence failed to show any negligence whatever of plaintiff that in any way contributed to the injury sustained, either directly or in any manner whatever. The most that could be claimed is that the question of contributory negligence should have been submitted to the jury, which was done. Boland v. Oily of Kansas, 32 Mo. App. 9 ; Taylor v. Railroad, 26 Mo. App. 336; Petty v. Railroad, 88 Mo. 306; Leslie v. Railroad, 88 Mo. 50; Loss v. Railroad, 59 Mo. 27; Kelly r>. Railroad, 70 Mo. 607. (2) Neither of the rules invoked by appellant in his brief has any application to the case at bar. The act\\'of turning a work mule loose to follow along the highway, under the facts and circumstances in this case, is not an act of such a character that the judgment of all men would condemn it; nor is it negligence which\\' mingled with the negligence of defendant was the direct and efficient cause of the injury. The whole question was one for the jury. See authorities last above cited. (3) It is not contended that the erection of a barbed wire fence along the line of a public highway is in itself necessarily an actionable wrong, yet the manner in which it is constructed and maintained may be such as to make the party erecting and maintaining it guilty of negligence. And if the fence was not such as a good husbandman would construct or maintain, but was insufficient and dangerous in its character, and an animal passing along the highway accidentally strayed or ran into it and was injured, the party erecting and maintaining such fence certainly would be liable. Beck v. Carter, 68 N. Y. 283 ; Craves v. Thomas, 95 Tnd. 362; Lisk v. Crump, 112 Ind. 504; Lisk v. Crump, 14 N. E. Rep. 381, and cases cited; Loveland v. Gardner, 21 Pac. Rep. 766; Fink v. Furnatíe Co., 10 .Mo. App. 69. (4) Under our statutes plaintiff had the right to turn his mule loose on the public highway and allow him to run at large; and while defendant might erect and maintain a barbed wire fence by statute, he was bound to see that it was not made a trap for. straying or passing animals. If it is conceded, as claimed by defendant, that a lawful barbed wire fence is dangerous in its character, as well as one improperly constructed, then defendant had only the right to build such a barbed wire fence as the statute prescribes, and a barbed wire fence built any other way is per se a tort, and the defendant liable for damages resulting therefrom. Lisle v. Crump, and Loveland v. Gardner, supra. (5) It is submitted, that if defendant had negligently built and maintained any kind of a fence along the public highway dangerous in its character — not authorized by law, and plaintiff’s mule had become accidentally entangled in it while lawfully in, or passing along, such highway, and had been injured or killed thereby, the defendant would have been liable for damages sustained. Young v. Harvey, 16 Ind. 314; Birge v. Gardner, 19 Conn. 507; Durham v. Musselman, 18 Am. Dec. 133; Railroad v. Mien, 22 Kan. 236; Powers v. Harlow, 19 N. W. Rep. 259; Railroad v. Hudson, 62 Ga. 680; Jones v. Nichols, 46 Ark. 207. (6) The court did not err in refusing defendant’s instructions. See authorities cited. It was not\\' contributory negligence for plaintiff to voluntarily turn his mule loose upon the public road to go at will, for he had the legal right to do so. Gorman v. Railroad, 26 Mo. 441; Busby v. Railroad, 81 Mo. 43. (7) The court did not err, but properly submitted the question of the dangerous character of the fence, and the prudence and care, or want of care and negligence, of the plaintiff in conducting and managing his mule in and along the highway, to the jury.

Where it is uncertain what land is included in a devise, oral evidence is admissible to identify the subject-matter of the devise. The intention of a testator is to be determined from the words written in his will. If his wishes with regard to the disposition of his property, as thus expressed, can be applied to the existing conditions of that property, the result must be accepted. It is not competent to show by declarations of the testator made at the execution of his will or subsequently, that he intended a devise to include something that is excluded by the terms of the will as executed. Where testator devises a property, describing it by a number of a street, “ and also all the personal property contained therein,” and it appears that this property was the residence of testator at the time of his death, the devise cannot be construed to include more than the dwelling house and its immediate curtilage, by evidence which in effect was, that many years prior to the making of the will and of defendant’s death, which were only a few days apart, defendant bought a lot which extended from one street to another ; that he built his dwelling on one end of the lot, and a carpenter shop on the other end; that subsequently he remodeled the carpenter shop into a dwelling house, which was then given a number on the back street, and was rented to tenants; that shortly thereafter testator caused to be erected across the lot a substantial board fence without any gate or opening in it, and that the two houses with the lots respectively appurtenant, continued to be used in the manner described until the death of the testator.

       "  'case_summary': \"Henry H. Gage v. Thaddeus Hampton. Filed at Ottawa January 25, 1889. 1. Limitation—act of 1889—color of title. A tax deed purporting to convey land to the grantee therein named, is good color of title. 2. Same—as to vacant and unoccupied land. Where the holder of color of title, acquired in good faith, pays all the taxes legally assessed upon the land to which the color of title relates, for seven successive years, while it remains vacant and unoccupied, and then takes actual possession by enclosing the same with a fence, the bar of the statute will be complete, and the holder of such title may assert the same, either as a defense, or to regain possession when invaded. 3. Evidence—payment of taxes—parol evidence. The payment of taxes may be proved by parol evidence. Tax receipts may be explained, and if a mistake has been made in the description of the land or in the name of the person who actually made the payment, resort may be had to parol evidence to rectify such mistake. 4. Same—sufficiency of evidence—to show payment of taxes. To prove the payment of taxes for the years 1880 and 1881 by H. H. Gage, two tax receipts were given in evidence, that for the tax of 1880 reading, “Received of Asahel Gage, by H. H. Gage,” and that for the taxes of 1881 reading, “Received of Asahel Gage,” etc. Asahel Gage testified that he never paid any taxes on 'the property, and never had in his possession any tax receipts for taxes paid .on the property; and H. H. Gage testified that he paid the taxes on the property from 1879 to 1886, both inclusive,— that for the years 1880 and 1881 he paid the taxes, and that he had the tax receipts ever since their issue, but could not tell how the name of Asahel Gage appeared therein: Held, that the evidence showed that H. H. Gage paid the taxes for the two years named. 5. Possession—what may constitute.• It is not necessary that a man shall reside upon property in order to obtain or hold possession of it. Possession of land may be acquired and held in different modes,—by inclosure, by cultivation, by the erection of buildings or other improvements, or, in fact, by any use that clearly indicates an appropriation to the use of the person claiming to hold the property. 6. The holder of color of title in good faith, after the payment of all the taxes on the land for over seven successive years, fenced the same with a post and board fence, the fence being completed September 10, 1887. In the latter part of December, 1887, the former owner or his agent visited the property, and found most of the fence on the north and east sides of the lot gone, but on the south and west sides the fence was mainly standing as erected. The latter re-fenced the property, using that part of the fence and materials remaining, and supplying the balance: Held, that the act of re-fencing conferred no rights on the party, the original fences remaining being enough to notify him that the property had been reduced to possession, and that his entry was wrongful, and a trespass. 7. Same—how possession may he acquired. The doctrine of this court is uniform, that a man can not take the law into his own hands, and regain by force a possession which he may be entitled to recover in an appropriate action. 8. The common law right to enter and use all necessary force to obtain possession from him who may wrongfully withhold it, has been taken away by our statute of forcible entry and detainer. Any entry is forcible, within the meaning of the statute, that is made against the will of the occupant. 9. Clotjd on title—of the character of complainant’s possession. A claimant of the legal title to land can not maintain a bill in chancery to set aside an adverse claim as a cloud on his, when he obtains possession of the land forcibly and unlawfully. In equity, he will be treated as though out of possession. The case of Fort Dearborn Lodge v. Klein, 115 Ill. 177, does not conflict with the rule here announced. Appeal from the Superior Court of Cook county; the Hon. Henry M. Shepard, Judge, presiding. Mr. Augustus N. Gage, for the appellant: The taxes were paid by appellant under color of title to vacant property for the requisite length of time, and though the receipts for two of the years stated that the payment was made by Asahel Gage by Henry H. Gage, and by Asahel Gage, the evidence showed that the payments were made, in fact, by Henry H. Gage, under his color of title, and this was sufficient to sustain his limitation. Rev.

Appellant has shown the requisite color of title in him by deed bearing date in 1877; that he has paid all taxes on the property from that time to 1886, being more than seven years; that the property was vacant all these years, and that after paying those taxes he took actual possession of the property. This constituted a good defense -under the limitation laws of this State, and entitled him to ask affirmative relief of the court, in the premises. Mr. H. S. McCartney, for the appellee.\",\n",

The courses and distances in a deed always give way to the boundaries found upon the ground or supplied by proof of their former existence when the marks or monuments are gone. Where a boundary line in a deed is described as being about a certain number of feet “ to the line of lot recently conveyed to C.,” and it appears that C.’s lot was fenced, and that the grantee understood that he was purchasing only to C.’s lot, the distance mentioned in the deed must give way to the boundaries found upon the ground. Argued April 15, 1902. Appeal, No. 27, April T., 1902, by defendants, from judgment of C. P. Allegheny Co., May T., 1899, No. 890, on verdict for plaintiff in case of Emily A. Long v. Thomas L. Shields, Helen D. Shields, W. B. Scott and Robert Clark. Before Rice, P. J., Beaver, Orlady, W. W. Porter and W. D. Porter, JJ. Affirmed. Trespass quare clausum fregit. Before Evans, J. The court charged as follows: The plot of ground in dispute together with considerable ground on both sides of it was prior to the spring of 1884 in the possession and ownership of two men by the name of McKinney, Dr. David McKinney and Rev. W. W. McKinney. In that year they sold off, I believe, all the property which you have heard described in the progress of this casé to two different persons ; but among others they sold to Mrs. Craig a piece of land fronting on Seminary lane and running back to the line óf property of John H. Hampton about 212 feet. The exact location of that property sold is the question in dispute here. [By the lines as established by the wording of the deed, the line of this land sold to Mrs. Craig at that time next to the railroad would be on the location of the fence which now separates the land in possession of the plantiff and of the defendants, and would give to the defendants the title to the land in dispute. It is alleged by plaintiff that at the time this conveyance was made to Mrs. Craig on April 21, 1884, the lot which was conveyed to her was enclosed by four fences, one on each side ; that she was taken upon the ground by the agent of the McKinneys, shown the lot of ground so fenced in, and that a sale was made to her of that property bounded by those four fences; that the deed was delivered to her, that she went into possession through her tenant of this field or lot bounded by these fences, and that she and her vendees, that is, the persons purchasing from her, the plaintiff in this case, remained in possession of that lot of ground from April 21,1884, until some time in the summer or fall of 1898, when this trespass is alleged to have taken place. For the purposes of this case, I charge you that if that is the fact, and that fact is not disputed, that would control the lines as laid down in the deed; and the property actually conveyed to Mrs. Craig on April 21, 1884, would be the land enclosed by those four fences, even if the description of that land differed from the description which was set forth in the deed.] [7] That is a question of law. That is the law in this case, and you will follow it. [Let me repeat that if you believe the testimony, and it is not disputed, that Mrs. Craig was taken upon the ground, that she bought the lot of ground enclosed by those four fences and took possession of it, then the land described by the fences was the land that she bought, even if the deed that they referred to differed in its description of the land. You will probably have no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that wherever this land was situated, it was that lot bounded by those four fences that Mrs. Craig bought; because, as I have said, the testimony on that point is undisputed.] [8] It was my recollection that Mrs. Craig went on the ground with the agent of the vendor and looked at it. If I am mistaken in that, the jury will correct me. However, there is another question of fact in the case which you will have to determine, and that is the question of the location of these fences, or one of them. It appears to be admitted on all sides that between this lot (and I speak of the lot now as the ground enclosed by these fences), and the Ft. Wayne railroad, there was a driveway immediately adjoining it on the side of the railroad, leading from the Seminary lane back to the stable, and that driveway was fenced on both sides, both on the side next to the property that was sold to Mrs. Craig and on the line of the alley or driveway next to the railroad. The question in dispute is the location of the fence on the side of that alley farthest from the railroad and next to the line of the Craig lot. In 1885 one of these two fences was torn down and a new fence erected in the place of it, by the defendants in this case, at least by two of them, Mr. and Mrs. Shields. The plaintiff alleges, and has offered evidence to substantiate the fact, that the new fence erected in 1885 was on the side of the alley farthest from the railroad and next to the line of the lot of Mrs. Craig. If that be true, then it is admitted that the present fence erected by the defendants is eighteen feet over on the land of the plaintiff, Mrs. Long, assuming that her line ran to the alleyway. The defendants allege that the new fence that was erected was built on the line of the fence on the side of the alley next to the railroad, or farthest from the Craig lot. If that be true, if I remember the figures accurately, then the present fence built there in 1898, is substantially on the line of the old fence which separated the alleyway from Mrs. Craig’s lot. Now, you see the importance of determining on what side the fence erected in 1885 was built. In this matter there is a direct contradiction between-the testimony of the plaintiff and that of the defendants. It is the duty of the plaintiff to satisfy you by the weight of the evidence that her contention is correct. That is, if the evidence evenly balances, then the ver diet should be for the defendants. If the evidence is stronger for the plaintiff than for the defendants, then your verdict should be for the plaintiff. In determining that, you consider all the testimony offered, the interest of the parties, the interest of the witnesses or their disinterestedness, their capacity for knowing, their creditability, and all the circumstances which go to make up the weight which you will give to their testimony. If you find that the fence erected there in 1885 was on the line of the alley which separated the Craig lot from at that time the Dickinson lot, as they were fenced in (I do not mean now with reference to the courses and distances marked in the deed, but as they were there on the ground, unfenced), then your verdict should be for the plaintiff, provided that you are satisfied' that the land was bought, as I have before explained to you, by the monuments as they existed on the ground. In that case, your verdict should be for the plaintiff. The title in that case to this strip of ground would be in the plaintiff in this suit, and the breaking down of the other fence and the entry on that ground and erecting a fence across it would be a trespass. The next question for you to determine, in that case, would be, what damage did the plaintiff suffer? She suffered, of course, an injury to her possession, which would entitle her to at least nominal damages. She suffered, in addition to this, any actual loss which she may have sustained by the destruction of growing crops, if any, that she had upon the premises at the time, and by being deprived of the possession of the premises from the time of the trespass until the present time. You have heard the testimony on that subject and I need not go over it. Of course, if you find, under the direction that I have given to you, that the title to this strip of eighteen feet is in the defendant in this case, Mrs. Shields, then your verdict should be for the defendant. [If you find, on the 'other hand, that Mrs. Craig bought the land bounded by those fences, then the difference in the description of that lot as so bounded and the lot as described in the deed would be construed in favor of Mrs. Craig’s right to the title to the land as bounded by the fences;]. [9] and if you find that the present fence is within the line of that, that is, if the fence of 1885' was erected on the line of the alley next to Mrs. Craig, then it is admitted that the present fence is eighteen feet over on her line, and your verdict should be for the plaintiff for whatever damages she has suffered. Defendant presented these points : 1. That under all the evidence defendant has shown title to the strip in question and the verdict should be for defendant. Answer: Refused. [4] 2. The undisputed testimony being that the present fence complained of is found to agree with the courses and distances of the dividing line as called for by the deed of both parties, such line must control and no different intention can be given to such grant by parol. Answer: Refused. [5] 4. A fence such as shown in this case is not of such a stable nature as to be considered a monument, unless made so by the calls in the deeds, and it cannot control the description in the deeds. Answer : Refused. [6] Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $175. Defendant appealed. Errors assigned among others were (4-9) above instructions, quoting them. C. C. Dickey and O. S.

Laws 1894, c. 755, § 1, providing that “barbed wire shall not be used in the construction of any division fence constructed or built after Sept. 1, 1894, unless the person, association, or corporation desiring to use such material shall first obtain the written consent of the owner of the adjoining property,” is not a statute in derogation of the common law, and must be liberally construed; and the words “constructed or built” must be interpreted as though it read “repaired, constructed, or built.” 2. Fences—Barbed Wire—Component Part. A single strand of barbed wire running in a straight line parallel to the line of general direction of a worm rail fence, and attached to each alternate lock joint thereof, is a component part of such fence. 3. Statutes—Construction. In Laws 1894, c. 755, § 2, the language, “any person * * * who shall construct or build a division fence of barbed wire shall be liable in treble damages,” etc., includes a tenant building such a fence, and does not have exclusive reference to the owner of the land. 4. Landlord and Tenant—Several Liability. A lease providing that the landlord “will furnish some wire and posts to repair or make fences wdth, and the lessee is to do the work,” does not reheve the lessee from liability (Laws 1894, c. 755) for using barbed wire in the construction of division fences on the leased land. ■5. Pleading—Necessary Parties. In an action against a tenant under Laws 1894, c. 755, for damages for the use by him of barbed wire in the construction of a division fence, the landlord is not a necessary party defendant. •6. Statute—Modification—Repeal. Laws 1894, c. 755, providing that division fences shall not be constructed of barbed wire without the consent of the adjoining owner, is not repealed, but merely modified, by Laws 1896, c. 524, providing that such consent is unnecessary when the fences are constructed as therein provided. 7. Same—Constitutionality. Laws 1894, c. 755, providing that barbed wire shall not be used for division fences without the adjoining owner’s consent, and that persons violating the act shall be liable to the adjoining owner for treble the damage resulting to the latter therefrom, is constitutional. Action by Daniel Buckley against Thomas Clark for damages to stock. Judgment for plaintiff. Following are the agreed facts, viz.: Cornelius T. Archer, Daniel Buckley, and Thomas Clark all reside in the town ■of Porter, county of Niagara, and state of New York. Archer and Buckley are the owners of adjoining farms in the aforesaid town, which farms are separated by a worm rail division fence, with joint locks alternating upon the farms of said Archer and Buckley. No barb wire was originally used in the construction of said division fence. At all times mentioned in the complaint, Clark was lawfully in possession of and occupying the farm of Archer under the written lease of said farm from Archer to Clark, for a term of three years from March 1, 1894, to March 1, 1897. At the times mentioned in the complaint, Archer had neglected and was neglecting to make a sufficient division fence in accordance with the regulation prescribed for the town of Porter. Under the terms of said lease, in the month of April, 1895, Clark procured barbed wire for fencing purposes at the expense of Archer, and thereafter, and because of the insufficiency of that portion of the line fence above described to be maintained by said Archer, strung a single barbed wire parallel to and along and upon a part of that portion of the division fence which by agreement between Buckley and Archer should be maintained by Archer, and which had thereafter been maintained by him. Said barbed wire was fastened to joint locks of said worm rail division fence, which joint locks stood wholly on the farm of said Archer, then from said joint locks to the next joint locks standing wholly on the farm of Archer, and so on till said wire had been strung to about twelve of said joint locks, each of which stood wholly upon the farm of Archer. The wire so strung was wholly upon and over the property of Archer, and at no point upon or over the property of Buckley, or over an angle of said worm fence projecting from the property of Buckley to a joint lock on the farm of Archer. Clark did not obtain the written consent or any consent of Buckley to the stringing of said single barbed wire as aforesaid. Buckley at the time mentioned herein was occupying and in possession of his adjoining farm, and was the owner of a gray mare worth $80, which jumped over said worm rail division fence aforesaid in the month of September, 1895, became entangled in the .aforesaid barbed wire, and was cut, torn, wounded, bruised, and injured in and about the body and legs by the barbs of said wire to such an extent that she became sick, sore, and lame, and was, now is, and never will be of any use or value to Buckley or to any other person, on account of the injuries so received aforesaid. Buckley brought this action against Clark for treble damages for the injuries to his horse under an act of the legislature of the state of New York entitled “An .act to regulate the use of barbed wire in the construction of division fence,” passed May 22, 1894, and being chapter 755 of the Laws of 1894.

A mere encroachment on a public highway, by a fence, will not authorize the removal of the fence by an individual, unless it hinders, impedes or obstructs the use of the road by the public. Morgan, J. dissented. An encroachment of a fence upon the highway is not a public nuisance, so as to authorize an individual to abate it, unless it interferes with the use of the road by the public. His justification will be limited by the necessity of the case; and if the use of . the road is not interfered with by the fence, he will be a trespasser, in removing it. One aggrieved by a private nuisance may have his action, or he may abate the nuisance. A party sustaining a special injury from a public or common nuisance may also have his action, and in the like case he may abate the nuisance. If there be a nuisance in a public highway, a private individual cannot of his j own authority abate it, unless it does him a special injury; and he can only ' interfere with it so far as is necessary tp exercise his right of passing along the highway, doing no unnecessary damage. If one can, with reasonable care, notwithstanding the act complained of, enjoy the right or franchise belonging to him, he is not at liberty to destroy or interfere with the property of the wrongdoer. ACTION of trespass, tried, before Morgan, J. and a jury, at the Onondaga circuit. The act complained of was the removal of a fence which the plaintiff had built within the line of a public highway. There was conflicting evidence whether the fence obstructed or hindered the travel in the road, or interfered with the use of the road by the public. The justice charged the jury that they would determine where the south bounds of the road- were as in fact fenced in, and' worked as a public road for the twenty years prior to the erection of the fence by the plaintiffs ; tfnd if they found that the fence was in the road as thus used, it would constitute a nuisance, which the defendants who traveled the road might remove. ' The court was requested to charge, 1. That a mere encroachment on the road by the fence did not authorize the removal of the fence by the defendants, unless it hindered, impeded or obstructed the use of the road by the public; and 2d. That an encroachment of a fence upon the road is not a public nuisance, so as to authorize an individual to abate, it, unless it interferes with the use of the road by the public. These instructions were refused, on the ground that it was not such a case; although there might be cases where persons might interfere with a mere encroachment, and that this amounted to an obstruction if it was within the limits of the highway as actually fenced and used. That the defendants had a right to the full width of the road as fenced and used, although they may have been able to get by the obstruction without any serious inconvenience. The plaintiffs had no right to narrow the road, and if they did put their fence in the road, the defendants could remove it, doing no unnecessary damage. Exception^ were taken, as well to the refusal to charge as to the various legal propositions charged, and the jury found a verdict for the defendants; and from the judgment entered thereon the plaintiffs appealed.

Plaintiff executed an agreement to convey a right of way through his land, to the H. railroad company for a nominal sum, the company to build a fence on both sides, whereupon the company took possession, built and operated its road, and executed a mortgage on the same, and thereafter consolidated, with defendant railroad company, which after the consolidation acquired the mortgage title by purchase at foreclosure sale in proceedings wherein plaintiff was not a party. Held, in ejectment, where defendant set up its mortgage-title, and asked for specific performance of plaintiff’s agreement, that a decree directing plaintiff to execute a deed upon defendant’s building the fence,. and paying damages for not having built it before, will not be disturbed. Appeal from circuit court, Rockland county. Ejectment by Henry Helmke against the New Jersey & New York,, Railroad Company for a strip of land through plaintiff’s tract used by defendant as a right of way, and which was the subject of an agreement to convey, executed by plaintiff to defendant’s predecessor in, interest, the Hackensack & New York Extension Railroad Company. Defendant claimed as successor in interest, and as purchaser at mortgage foreclosure sale of all the rights and franchises of its predecessor, and demanded a specific performance of plaintiff’s agreement to convey. From a judgment decreeing a specific performance by delivery of a. deed by plaintiff upon defendant’s building the fence, and paying damages for not having built it before, defendant appeals. Affirmed. The agreement to convey was as follows: “In consideration of the sum of one dollar, to me in hand paid by the Hackensack & New York Extension Railroad Company, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, I do, for myself and my legal representatives, agree to sell to said company all my right, title, and interest in and to certain lands situated in the town of Ramapo, Rockland county, and state of New York, which said lands are described as follows, to wit: Comprising a width of 264 feet upon the easterly side, and 39| feet upon the westerly side, on side of the center line of said railroad, as the same is now located, across the whole width of my land, according to the location of the said center line. Said railroad agrees to'build and maintain a lawful fence upon each side of said railroad.

       "  'case_summary': \"Griffith vs. McCullum and Van Slyke. There is, or may be, a wide difference between an encroachment upon a high- • way by fences, and a public nuisance. Every encroachment is not a nuisance. A nuisance must be something that annoys the public. If the encroachment, by fences, upon the highway, is of such a nature that no one, in using the highway, is incommoded, then it is not a nuisance. That which' is exclusively a common or public nuisance can not lawfully be abated by the private act of individuals. The remedy is, an indictment—a criminal prosecution; unless some other remedy has been provided by statute. A private nuisance may he abated by the party aggrieved. A nuisance ipay be a public and a private nuisance. In such a case the public may proceed, by indictment, to abate it, and punish its author, or those individuals to whom it is a private nuisance by reason of its being specially inconvenient and annoying to them, or because they are in some particular way incommoded thereby, may of their own act abate it. In the case of a private nuisance, the aggrieved party has an election of remedies. He may remove the .nuisance, or he may have his action for the private damages sustained by him; but he can not have both remedies. Unless the encroachment upon a highway, by fences, is such as to constitute _a private nuisance, as well as a public nuisance, an individual, even thqugh he be commissioner of highways, is not justifiable in removing the fence. The remedy is given by the provisions of our highway statutes relating to encroachments ; and to that remedy the commissioners should resort, instead of causing the fence to he removed. ACTION for breaking and entering the close of the plaintiff. Defense, that the locus in quo was a public highway, and that the fences removed were an obstruction to the highway, and a public nuisance. The defendant McCullum, was the sole commissioner of highways of the town, (Pike,) and, as such, he caused the fence to be removed. The defendant Van Slyke removed the- fence by direction of MeCullum. The evidence proved, or tended to prove, that the fence of the plaintiff was built and stood within the bounds of the highway as laid out and opened. The counsel for the plaintiff requested the court to charge that it was a question of, fact for the jury tó find whether the fence, erected where it was, was or was not a nuisance; and if it was not, then that the defendants were liable for tearing down and injuring the fence in the manner proved, even though the fence may have been within the bounds of the highway. The court refused, so to charge, and the plaintiff excepted. Also, that if the fence, where it was, did not render the highway in any manner dangerous, or inconvenient, or amount to an annoyance of the public, or any part of the public, then the defendants were liable, even though the fence was actually in the highway. Refusal and exception. Also that the court submit to the jury the question whether the fence was such an annoyance to the public, or any portion of the public, as to make it a nuisance ; and if it was not, then that the defendants were liable, &c. Eefusal and exception. Also that if the fence did not in any way discommode any of the public, but rendered the highway better, and more safe for the public than it would be without the fence, then the defendants were liable. Eefusal and exception. Also that the defendants had no more right to tear down the fence than they would have had if McCullum had not been a commissioner of highways. Eefusal and exception. The charge was, that if the jury were satisfied that the fence was within the bounds of the highway, the defendants had a right to take it down and remove it, and they were not liable for so. doing, unless they unnecessarily and unreasonably injured it in so doing. To this the plaintiff excepted. Also that if the fence was on any part of the highway, any person had a right to take it down and remove it, whether it was any annoyance, or inconvenience, or interruption to the public or any portion of the public, or not; Exception. Also that if the fence was erected in the highway it was a nuisance, as a matter of law, and the defendants had a right to take it down and remove it beyond the limits of the highway, doing no unnecessary injury to the fence.

       "  'case_summary': \"James McKee, Administrator, Appellee, v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Company, Appellant. 1. Railroads: roadways: duty to employes. It is the duty of a railroad company to use ordinary care and supervision to keep its roadway in a good and safe condition for the operation of its trains by its employes, to the end that its employes may not be exposed to unnecessary hazards in such employment. 2. -: negligence: construction of road: rules for employes: evidence. A rule of a railroad company, designed for the guidance of its track repairers, that ¡‘they must see that no lumber, wood, stone, materials or tools are placed at any time within five feet of the rail,” is not evidence that a cattle-guai’d fence built three feet and ten inches from the rail was improperly constructed. Neither is a rule' requiring such employes to keep the fences and cattle-guards in good repair evidence of the negligence of a railroad company in permitting such a fence to stand too close to the track, when it is not claimed that the fence in question was out of repair. 3. -:-:-: degree of care required. A brakeman on a freight train, observing that stones were being thrown from the track under one of the defendant’s cars, went forward from the caboose, and climbed down the ladder on the side of said car, and while hanging low on the ladder, and looking under the ear, with his back toward the locomotive, his head came in contact with a wing fence at the end of a cattle-guard, and he was instantly killed. The evidence showed that the stones which attracted the attention of the decedent were thrown out by a brakebeam, which was down and dragging; that in operating trains it sometimes happens that a brake-beam, or other appurtenance of the trucks of a car, gets out of order, and that it is the duty of the brakeman who discovers it to report the fact to the conductor, and under his direction to ascertain what, if anything, requires attention, and, if necessary, to stop the train; that to make the required examination it may be proper for the brakeman to descend the ladder at the end or on the side of the car, and look under it while the train is in motion. It did not appear, however, that such an event was of common occurrence, nor that any accident caused by the location of a wing fence had ever happened on the road of the defendant, although its road had been operated many years. Held, that conceding that the fence could, with reasonable care, have been so constructed that the decedent would have passed the same without injury, yet the accident was so improbable, and was due to causes of such rare occurrence, that the defendant, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, was not required to provide against it. 4. -: --:-: contributory negligence: use of defective appliances by employe. The decedent, having been employed as bralieman on the division of the road on which the accident occurred, for about three years, with his runs usually in daylight, and it appearing that there were about four hundred wing fences on such division, substantially like that in question as to plan of construction, and the distance thereof from the track; and it further appearing that the side ladders of a car could be used with safety in examining the condition of trains while passing said wing fences, but that it was apparent to anyone who had observed the width of the spaces between the fences and the passing cars, that a person could not safely swing out from a car while passing such a fence, on its level, more than two feet, held, that the decedent must be presumed to have known, from his opportunity to have acquired such knowledge, that the distance between the fence in question and a passing car 'made it unsafe for one to swing out more than two feet from the car, as he did, and that in exposing himself unnecessarily to such danger, the decedent was guilty of contributory negligence.

A deed which has been a matter of record for fifty-nine years is an ancient deed, and in absence of any evidence of fraud or suspicious circumstances it is not necessary to show proof of execution. 2. Same—when certificate of magistracy is unnecessary. Under the act of 1851, a deed acknowledged, prior to such act, before a justice of the peace in a county other than that where the land lies and recorded in the county where such land is situated is valid, although no certificate of magistracy is attached. 3. Ejectment—effect of affidavit that plaintiff and defendant claim through common source. If the plaintiff in ejectment makes affidavit that he claims through a common source with the defendant, and no counter-affidavit is filed by the defendant, the plaintiff need not trace title back of such common source. 4. Limitations—what not possession under color of title. Driving out to open prairie land upon an average of twice a year and occasionally picking flowers therefrom are not such acts as amount to possession adverse to the true owner. 5. Same—effect of payment of taxes without possession. If the holder of color of title to vacant land fails to unite possession with such color, the fact that he pays taxes before the true owner takes possession of the land does not give him any rights under section 7 of the Limitation act. 6. Same—what necessary to constitute possession. To constitute possession by the holder of color of title there must be such an appropriation of the land by him as to indicate to the neighborhood that it is appropriated to his exclusive use. 7. Same—when entry of holder of color of title is unavailing. If the holder of paramount title fences in unoccupied land, the fact that the holder of color of title subsequently enters upon a portion of the land and builds a house does not give him any rights under section 7 of the Limitation act. Appeal from the Circuit Court of Cook county; the Hon. E. P. Vail, Judge, presiding. This is an action of ejectment brought by appellants, against appellee, in the circuit court of Cook county. It appears that in 1836 John C. Phillips and wife conveyed to Clark Hollenback the west sixty acres of the east half of the south-west quarter of section 4, township 37, north, range 14, east of the third principal meridian, in Cook county, and that appellee is the heir-at-law of Clark Hollenback. Upon the trial there was filed an affidavit of plaintiffs’ attorney setting forth that plaintiffs claimed title to the premises through a common source with the defendant, namely through Clark Hollenback, deceased, the ancestor of the plaintiffs. There was no counter-affidavit, or denial under oath by any one on behalf of the defendant, of this affidavit of plaintiffs. Appellants also proved title to the said tract by due course of conveyances from the United States. The defendant relied solely upon section 7 of chapter 83, entitled “Limitations,” of the statutes, viz., color of title made in good faith, with pajiment of all taxes upon the part claimed by her for seven successive years, and to sustain the issues on her part offered in evidence as color of title a deed from James M. Flagg and wife to William J. H. Goldring, dated August, 1868, conveying “lots 43, 44, 45, 46, 47 and\\' 48, in block 4, in Flagg & McBride’s subdivision of the east half\" of the above sixty acres, which, from the evidence, seemed to cover a tract of ground 125 by 150 feet within the said sixty acres, but no plat was introduced in evidence showing any division or subdivision of the sixty-acre tract, and nothing appears to indicate if there was in fact such a subdivision made, or upon what part of the tract appellee’s lots are situated, or the size thereof, or any facts upon which their location might be determined. Appellee also offered in evidence tax receipts and extrinsic evidence to show payment of taxes upon the property claimed by her for more than seven successive years. It was admitted upon the trial that Mary Goldring was the sole devisee under the will of the said W. J. H. Goldring, and that the said will had been duly probated in the probate court of Cook county, Illinois. It appears from the record that the entire sixty-acre tract of land was an open prairie up to March, 1894, except that on part of it (but the exact part does not appear) there had been fenced in by some person or persons unconnected with either the appellants or the appellee, and whose identity is not disclosed, some five or ten small plats of ground not included in the land claimed by appellee. So far as the evidence discloses, up to March, 1894, neither appellants nor their predecessors in title had or claimed to have possession of any part of the sixty-acre tract, but during the early part of that month appellants erected a fence around the sixty acres in question, which fence remained for but a short space of time, —some of the witnesses putting it a week and others three or four weeks. During this period the fence was torn down several times, and each time appellants again re-placed it. In April of the same year, and about a month after the fence was first erected, W. J. H. Gold-ring moved or built a house upon the property and took possession of the tract of ground claimed by him. H. E. Long, a representative of appellants, testified that in October, 1895, the following conversation occurred between him and Goldring: “I said to him, ‘I represent the heirs of Clark Hollenback, who claim to own this land and had this land fenced some time the forepart of 1894. ’ He said, ‘Yes, there was a fence built there originally clear around this sixty acres, and an officer tore it down about the width of the street on the north side and I moved these two houses in here.’ I said, ‘Had you ever taken possession of this land that you now claim, before that?’ He said, ‘No, sir.’ ‘Did you ever have a house on it before?’ He said, ‘No, sir. ’ I then told him, I said, ‘We will have to bring suit to get you off of here unless you will get off peaceably, because we claim to own this land, and at my direction the land was fenced. ’ He then said he would not go off the land. I believe I asked him, before he went away, if he had ever built any fences on the land as he claimed they were before that, and he said no, he had not; he never had any possession of any part of it.” The only evidence in the record tending to show possession of Goldring prior to April, 1894, was the testimony of his daughter, Mrs. Dean, which was as follows: Q. “Did your father ever go out prior to the time he moved on this property, and look at it and walk over it, if you know? I mean if you ever were \"with him? A. “I have driven out there several times with him as far back as 1876,—centennial year. We walked all over the ground; picked some flowers—purple asters. Q. “How often did you go out with your father, as near as you can remember? A. “Sometimes it would average twice a year—twice a summer. Q. “To the property in question? A. “To drive out and around it.” So far as the record shows, aside from the few lots fenced in, there were no acts of any one indicating possession over this sixty-acre tract, except by an occasional squatter, and an unauthorized cutting of grass by one of the witnesses, who was a stranger to the title. Nothing appears in the record to indicate that Goldring, or any one for him, ever removed any crop from the premises, but, on the contrary, the evidence is clear that, aside from the few tracts fenced in, the property was used by the public generally. Upon the trial in the court below the jury returned the following special findings: Q. “Did the plaintiffs, through their agents, H. E. Long and Wesley Hollenback, fence the land mentioned in the declaration? If so, when?—A. Yes, March, 1894. Q. “Did the defendants, Goldring et al., after the plaintiffs had caused the land mentioned in the declaration to be fenced, move any building onto the land in question, and if so, when?—A. Did not move on, but built on in April, 1894,” The jury also returned a verdict in favor of the appellants as to the whole sixty acres, except the tract claimed by the defendant, Goldring, and found a verdict in favor of the defendant, Goldring, of not guilty as to the property claimed by her. The court overruled a motion for a new trial and for a judgment non obstante veredicto, and a judgment was afterwards rendered in favor of appellee for such part of the tract so claimed by her, from which judgment this appeal was taken.

But the judge, for the purposes of the trial, ruled that it did constitute an incumbrance upon the whole of the land now owned by the plaintiff, and which he held under said deed. To this ruling the defendants excepted. “ The case then proceeded to the jury, upon the amount of the plaintiff’s damages. “ Upon the point of what would constitute a ‘ sufficient fence ’ within the clause named, the defendants requested the judge tc rule that that would be a sufficient fence which the statute had denominated as a sufficient fence between adjoining proprietors under the Gen. Sts. e. 25, § 1. The judge declined to rule as requested; but did rule that a ‘ sufficient fence,’ within the meaning of the clause, need not necessarily be any better than such fences as adjoining proprietors of improved land are required to make and maintain under the statute, but that it must be a fence reasonably sufficient to keep animals from straying from the plaintiff’s land on to the line of the railroad. To this ruling the defendants excepted. “ The defendants further asked the judge to rule that upon a proper construction of the deed it did not appear that the obligation, if any, meant an obligation to make and maintain a division fence on each side of the line of the land conveyed to the railroad. The judge ruled otherwise, and the defendants excepted, “ Evidence was offered on both sides as to the cost of building and maintaining fences of wood and stone, reasonably sufficient for the purposes named in the last ruling; and also evidence of experts as to how far the existence of what was thus claimed by the plaintiff to be an incumbrance would affect the market value of the land ; the experts including in their estimates the cost of building and maintaining the fence. “ It appeared that when the plaintiff bought he knew nothing of the existence of this incumbrance, but that he had since built a wall along a portion of the line between his land and that of the railroad; and the superintendent of the railroad company testified that they should not release the plaintiff from the obligation in the deed; but there was no evidence as to whether said company had or had not ever made any request concerning a fence, or whether any refusal had been made to build one, nor in any way concerning the relations between the railroad and said plaintiff and his grantors, including said Timothy G. Coffin, or any acts or conduct of theirs adverse to the rights of the railroad., nor concerning the use or improvement or mode of occupation of the premises prior to the plaintiff’s purchase, nor whether there had been a need of any fence prior to the plaintiff’s purchase, nor whether the fence had been often or never renewed but the plaintiff testified that at the date of his purchase in 1866 there was an old fence near the line of the railroad, but not on it, and running but a short distance; and there was evidence that at the date of the plaintiff’s purchase certain fences existed on the plaintiff’s land to the west of the railroad. “ The defendants requested the judge to rule as follows : “ That if, during the whole period from the time of giving the deed to the corporation in 1839 to the date of the plaintiff’s deed in 1866, the plaintiff’s grantors and those who had preceded them as owners of the plaintiff’s land, and no other persons, have in any part performed what was stipulated in the deed to the corporation, and had not been required or requested to perform it by the corporation, then, a period of more than twenty years having elapsed, the right of the railroad to require performance is barred by the statute of limitations, and the incumbrance, if any, had ceased; that under such a state of facts the corporation could not enforce the contract expressed in the deed, whether regarded as a personal undertaking of the grantor or as an incumbrance on the land. “ That the plaintiff must show either that he had been compelled to pay damages, or that he is now legally bound under the deed to the corporation to maintain the fence or pay damages ; and that upon this question the statute of limitations applied. “ That the proper measure of damages is what the railroad corporation could recover in an action for a failure to perform the stipulation contained in the deed, regarded as an incumbrance. “ That as, at the time of the conveyance by the said Timothy Gr. Coffin to the railroad company, such corporations were not bound by law to fence their roads, the only obligation created by the clause would be, at the most, the cost of building and maintaining one half of the division fence. “ The judge declined to give the rulings as requested; but did instruct the jury, for the purposes of the trial, that the plaintiff was bound by this clause in the deed to build and maintain perpetually a ‘ sufficient ’ fence (having duly instructed them as to what was meant by a 6 sufficient ’ fence) on both sides of the railroad, and for its whole length; that this constituted an incumbrance on the whole of the plaintiff’s land which he now owned on both sides of the railroad (the same being in feet the land purchased of said defendants by the said deed) ; that the rule of damages for the breach of the covenant against this incumbrance' was a just compensation for the real injury resulting from such incumbrance ; that, in determining this question, they were not alone to consider the cost to the plaintiffs of building and maintaining such fence, but were also to inquire how far the existence of this incumbrance impaired the value of the estate to the owner, and what would be the difference in its fair market value, by reason of the existence of this incumbrance — including in the depreciation, if any, the cost of building and maintaining the fence, and not treating that as an additional item — and upon the whole evidence allow him a just compensation for the real injury thus sustained. To these rulings and refusals to rule the defendants excepted.” The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $1140, which by the terms of the report was to stand, or be set aside and a new trial had upon such rulings as this court should determine to be proper. The case was argued at October term 1870, before all the judges but Colt, J. J. Brown, for the defendants. T. M. Stetson, for the plaintiff.\",\n",

Public Lands (§ 19 ) — “Unlawful Inclosube of Public Lands” — Suit fob Injunction. Defendant cattle company constructed and maintained a fence about 40 miles long around 37,000 acres of land, 26,000 acres of which was public land. The remainder was mostly owned by defendant and practically surrounded that owned by the government. The fence was built entirely on such land, no part of it being on the government land, and there were nine openings in it, varying from 90 to 3,400 feet in length.

To constitute a sufficient notice by a commissioner of highways of an obstruction or encroachment upon a highway, to create a liability for the penalty provided in case of neglect or refusal to remove the same, under the statute (Laws of 1890, chap. 568, §105), which requires such notice to specify “the extent and location of such obstruction or encroachment,” the notice must be so precise and explicit as to enable the person upon whom it is served to fix the place and extent of the obstruction or encroachment without doubt or uncertainty. 2. Insufficient Notice to Remove Encroachment upon Highway. A notice by a highway commissioner to remove an encroachment upon a. highway, which, after stating, in substance, that the highway commissioner has ascertained that the highway in question is encroached upon on the north side upon the land of the person served, by a fence erected by such person, which forms a part of the inclosure of his land, and that the commissioner has caused a survey to be made and ascertained the northerly bounds thereof, proceeds as follows: “And that said fence or fences encroaches upon said highway along the whole of your said land to the westerly line thereof at different distances, ranging from seven feet four inches to fifteen feet (as more particularly appears by reference to a map thereof now in my possession, and which you are at liberty to inspect at any time), and that all the narrow strip or piece of land which lies under said fence or fences, and between said fence or fences and the northerly line of said highway, is a part of the public highway aforesaid”—does not specify the extent and location of the encroachment with sufficient precision and explicitness to satisfy the requirements of the statute of 1890. Town of Sardinia v. Butler, 78 Hun, 527, reversed. (Argued April 23, 1896; decided May 26, 1896.) Appeal from judgment of the General Term\" of the Supreme Court in the fifth judicial department, entered upon an order made June 20, 1894, which affirmed a judgment in favor of plaintiff entered upon a verdict, and also affirmed an order denying a motion for a new trial. In November, 1892, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant in a Justice’s Court before Willis G. Clark, Esq., a justice of the peace in and for the town of Concord, Erie county, 1ST. Y., to recover the penalty provided by section 105 of chapter 568 of the Laws of 1890, for the defendant’s neglect or refusal to remove an alleged encroachment upon one of the highways of that town. Upon the return of the summons the defendant filed an answer setting forth facts showing that the title to real property would come in question, and gave the undertaking required by section 2952 of the Code of Civil Procedure, thereby discontinuing that action. Subsequently and in the following month this action was commenced in the Supreme Court for the same cause of action. The defendant’s answer consisted of a general denial and of affirmative allegations to the effect that the land upon which the alleged encroachment existed was no part of any public highway, but belonged to the defendant free from any easement or right of way over it in the plaintiff or any other person or municipal corporation. The issue thus joined came on for trial before the Supreme Court at the Erie Circuit, May 22, 1893, and resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff for twenty-five dollars. A judgment was entered thereon for $25 damages and $128.55 costs August 22, 1893. From that judgment the defendant appealed to the General Term of the fifth department, where it’ was affirmed, and the judgment of affirmance, with $97.47 costs, was entered June 21, 1894. From that judgment the defendant appealed to this court. The highway upon which it is alleged that the appellant’s fence encroached was laid out in July, 1822, and was three rods in width. The farm on the north side of the highway was purchased by the appellant in 1866, at which time there was an old and crooked fence between the farm and roadway. In the following spring he re-built and straightened it to some extent, and it remained as thus re-built until 1882, when the then commissioner of highways caused a survey to be made, and stakes.were driven along the entire line of the appellant’s land to indicate the north line of such highway. Afterwards the appellant made his fence conform substantially to the line thus .established, except that he erected it north and beyond the north line of the highway as thus indicated. He subsequently built a wire fence along the highway on the westerly-portion of his farm. It was located in the center of the strip of land upon which the rail fence formerly stood. On the trial, after the plaintiff had opened the case, the defendant’s counsel moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and specifically on the ground of the insufficiency of the notice served upon him to remove his fence. The defendant’s counsel then stated to the court that the defendant could not, from the notice, ascertain where he was to put the fence, or what he was to remove, and consequently the penalty was not incurred. This motion was denied and the defendant’s counsel duly excepted. At the close of the plaintiff’s evidence the defendant moved for a nonsuit on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to make out a cause of action, and that no proper notice had been served upon him to remove the fence, and no proper steps taken to charge him with a penalty. This motion was also denied and an exception taken. At the close of the whole evidence the defendant asked the court to direct a verdict for the defendant upon the ground that under the evidence as it then stood the defendant was not liable for the penalty sought to be recovered, as there had been no encroachment shown. That motion was likewise denied and an exception taken by the defendant. D. S. Alexander for appellant. The notice served upon defendant to remove his fences is incurably defective, because of the want of sufficient precision and certainty in describing the particulars of the encroachment complained of.

The notice served fully complies with the statute. The location and extent of the encroachment are fully stated. The defendant well knew the location of the original fence. (James v. Sammis, 132 N. Y. 239; Hathaway v. Jenks, 67 Hun, 292.) The defendant had encroached upon the highway, as stated in the notice. (Angell on Highways [3d ed.], 183; Cleveland v. Cleveland, 12 Wend. 172.) The acquiescence on the part of the highway officials of the town in the occupation of a portion of the highway by an individual, will not deprive the public of its rights. (City of Cohoes v. D. & H.

Appeal from Muscatine District Court. — How. Walter I. Hayes, Judge. Filed, May 23, 1888. Plajwtiee Laura F. Butterfield is the widow, and the other parties plaintiff are the children and heirs at law, of Franklin Butterfield, deceased. The said Franklin Butterfield, in his lifetime, conveyed the real estate in controversy to the trustees of the Wilton Collegiate Institute. After his death one W. F. Hayford recovered a judgment against said institute establishing and foreclosing a mechanic’s lien on the property for work done and materials furnished in making certain repairs of the building situated thereon. The property was sold under special execution issued on said judgment, and the certificate of sale was assigned to defendant Levi Herr, to whom the sheriff executed a deed. He subsequently conveyed to the Wilton Academy. The Wilton Collegiate Institute was an educational institution, founded and maintained by the “ Free-Will Baptists,” but before the sale that denomination had ceased to maintain a school in the property. The Wilton Academy is also an educational institution, but was founded and is maintained by another religious denomination, although its prescribed course of study is substantially the same as that formally prescribed by the collegiate institute. Plaintiffs brought this action for the recovery of the property on the alleged ground that the sale of the property under judicial process, and the failure of the “Free-Will Baptists” to maintain a school in it, were in violation of the conditions contained in the deed of their ancestor, and consequently it had reverted to them.

Plaintiff must show actual possession of the land at time of alleged trespass. 3.

The defendant’s pleas were, “ Not guilty” and ‘‘Statute of limitations.” Under said pleas the defendant sought to introduce evidence tending to show that the title to the said land was in the defendant and not in the plaintiff. This was objected to by counsel for plaintiff, on the ground that under the plea of “ Not guilty” such proof was not admissible, and could only be given under the plea of liberum tenementum. Defendant’s counsel contended that under the plea of ‘ ‘ Not guilty,” the general issue in the case, they could show not only that the defendant did not commit the trespass alleged, but also that he had the freehold title in the property. That the plea of liberum tenementum admitted the trespass, and also possession in the plaintiff, and was necessary if the defendant desired that the plaintiff should re-assign and set out definitely the circumstances under which the alleged trespass was committed. i Chitty's Pleading, *501; Stephen on Pleading, IJ4.; Hunter vs. Lank, 1 Harr., 10; Clark vs. Hill, 1 Harr., 333; Proprietors of Monumoi Great Beach vs. Rodgers, 1 Mass., iyg; 2 Greenleaf on Evidence, Secs. 613 and 623.\",\n",

ERROR to tbe Common. Pleas of Bradford county. This was an action on the case by Lewis D. Eowler v. George Jenkins, for removing a fence, by which injury was sustained by the plaintiff. Eowler and Jenkins owned lands adjoining each other, the division line running east and west. A public road had been laid out on the division line through their unimproved land. Subsequently each party cleared off his land to the road, and put in a crop of wheat, and in the spring following each one built a fence to secure his crop, the fences meeting at the centre of the road, and obstructing it. It did not appear from the evidence brought up that the road had been opened when the fence was removed. A witness testified that he was one of the commissioners when the road was laid out. He added : “ After we were there, and laid.out the road, there was no act of any commissioner, to my knowledge, by way of opening the road. I think it was not cleared out or opened on the side of the hill where it was laid until after -the crop of wheat was taken off.” After Jenkins had his wheat taken in, and after Eowler had commenced to cut his wheat, a part of the fence was removed by Jenkins, and cattle got into the field. Eor the injury caused by them the action was brought. On part of the defendant the Court was, inter alia, asked, secondly, to charge, that if the parties by agreement or otherwise built their fences so as to meet in the centre of the highway, either of them might at any time remove the part of the fence •put up by him in the highway, and that the other party had no right of action for injury to his crops by cattle of others coming upon his land over the part of the highway from which the fence had been removed. Wilmot, J., charged that the “ road was laid by authority, and dedicated to the public use, and the fence was an illegal obstruction.” That the second point was correct with the qualification, that if the defendant threw down the fence out of motives of malice towards the plaintiff — that he acted from a wicked and wanton purpose to do tbe plaintiff an injury, tbe action could be sustained.

On an indictment for a public nuisance, in maintaining a fence upon a public highway, the defence that the highway, as actually opened and traveled, was not upon the location made by the report of the viewers confirmed by the Court of Quarter Sessions, and that by such report the fence was upon defendant’s own land, is inadmissible. Before Paxson, C. J., Sterrett, Green, Clark, Williams, McCollum and Mitchell, JJ. No. 127 October Term 1891, Sup. Ct.; court below, No. 54 February Term 1891, Q. S. On February 5, 1891, the grand jury returned as a true bill an indictment charging J. Charles Dicken with maintaining a public nuisance. The defendant pleaded not guilty. At the trial, on February 6, 1891, the commonwealth introduced testimony tending to show that in 1890, the defendant erected a fence and afterwards maintained the same, within the lines of a public highway leading from Greensburg to Latrobe. It was made to appear that, to No. 8 November Term 1875, Q. S., proceedings were had to change or straighten the highway in controversy; that, though the report of the viewers in favor of the change was confirmed, and an order to open issued and executed, yet the width of the road as changed had never been fixed. The defendant testified that his wife was the owner of the farm, and as such had erected and maintained the fence; and proposed to state, further, that “ when the viewers came upon the ground to vacate, alter, and change the public road, in 1875, under the order of court issued to them for that purpose, in my presence, my father, Jesse Dicken, the owner of the tract of land upon one side, agreed to release ten feet of his ground and did release ten feet; to be followed by evidence showing that the road was laid out and opened in conformity therewith, by the building of line fences upon each side by the owners of the respective properties, designating the width of the road, to wit, thirty feet.” Objected to, for the reasons: (1) that the viewers had no power to fix the width of the road; (2) because they did not fix the width of the road; (3) because the court never fixed the width of this road, and it could not be fixed by agreement of the landowners on either side. The court having failed in the order of confirmation to fix the width of the road, the order of confirmation was a nullity, and the road never could be opened because no width was ever fixed. It is further objected to,'because, if the question be competent at all, the record itself is the best evidence ; parol testimony of the witness is incompetent. By the court: Objection sustained.1 At the close of the testimony, Raybubn, P. J. 33d district, instructed the jury, answering certain points presented as follows : In behalf of the commonwealth, the court is respectfully asked to charge the jury as follows: 1. That the width of a road is an essential ingredient of it, and no proceeding to lay out a public road is complete, until the width is fixed by a competent tribunal. The record at No. 8 November Term 1875, shows that the width of this road was never fixed by the court; therefore, the proceeding was nugatory, it never having been completed. Answer: This point is affirmed. 2. It being the undisputed testimony that an order to open that road issued and went into the hands of George Bridge, the then supervisor, his act concludes the public as to the location of the road; the evidence showing that he executed it according to his understanding of it. There was no right in Mr. Dicken or anybody else to take a private surveyor and undertake to locate that road according to the report of the viewers, and set his fence out accordingly. Answer: This point we affirm. 3. If there is any obstruction of the traveled road between the Gallaher line and the western boundary of the Dicken farm, by reason of this new fence erected along the Dicken land, then the defendant is guilty and ought to be convicted. Answer: This point we affirm, if you find as a fact that this fence was constructed by Mr. Dicken or at his instance or request, and that the fence is an encroachment upon the road.3 4. If the jury believe that the fence in question was built out upon the public road, it was an offence to build it there; and if you further find that the defendant, J. Charles Dicken, counseled, advised, and assisted in the erection of this fence, then he would be equally guilty with those who actually built it, and he ought to be convicted. Answer : This point we affirm. In behalf of the defendant the court is respectfully asked to charge the jury as follows: 9. That if the jury believe that the fence does not encroach upon the road as designated by the view and report at No. 8 November Term 1875, in the Quarter Sessions of Westmoreland county, he cannot be convicted, nor if they have any reasonable doubt of the same. Answer: This point we refuse.3 10. That if the jury believe that the fence does encroach upon the traveled road, yet if the parties erecting the fence acted in good faith, and put the fence as they believed on the line between the Dicken property and the road, defendant cannot be convicted, even although they may find defendant aided and assisted in the erection of the same, having the same belief. Answer: This point we refuse. —The jury returned a verdict that the defendant was guilty.

While the ownership was in this condition, the public records showing only a title in S, who remained in possession, F employed a builder to make extensive repairs and alterations of the house, out-buildings and fences. The builder, with the consent of S, went upon the premises and began work. About three weeks later S, B and F met, and £ made a conveyance directly to F, and F at the same time and as part of the same transaction made a mortgage of the premises, free from encumbrance, to a savings bank for a loan of money, the bank having no actual knowledge of any claim of lien on the part of the builder, and the mortgage being made under a previous agreement of F to make it on his acquiring the title. Held that the savings bank acquired a lien that took precedence of the lien of the builder. (Two judges dissenting.) The builder had at the time done no work upon the house, but had brought a considerable quantity of lumber upon the premises, and had begun to build a fence around the lot. Whether this was sufficient to establish a lien : Quaere. The builder had undertaken the work upon an oral contract, and the work finally done was far more extensive than was expected by either party at the outset. Whether, if the builder’s lien had had precedence, it could have covered anything mor<5 than the work proposed to be done at the time the savings bank took its mortgage: Quaere. It seems that the case was not affected by the fact that a committee of the savings bank examined the property with reference to the making of the loan, and that the premises were at the time in a dilapidated condition and a new. fence was being built, and that the committee either saw, or by inattention failed to see, the work that was going on. Bill to foreclose a mortgage; brought to the Superior Court in Middlesex County. The respondents were F. Fel lowes, the mortgagor, and Erastus Phelps, who claimed a prior builder’s lien upon the property. The following facts were found by a committee: On the 1st day of May, 1869, the premises in question were owned in fee by one Roswell 0. Smith. H. & S. Bissell had previously contracted to purchase the property, and had obtained from Smith a written contract or bond for a deed. They were to pay for it in part by conveying to Smith a dwelling house worth about $20,000, and of which they had then delivered to him the possession, and the balance in cash on the delivery of the deed. After thus contracting for the purchase of the property, H. & S. Bissell had sold it by bargain to the respondent Fellowes, and had given him a bond for a deed, dated September 19tli, 1868. The time for the fulfillment of the contract on the part of Fellowes, originally limited by the bond, was extended from time to time until the 14th day of June, 1869. On the 1st day of May, 1869, by the consent and permission of Smith, who was then in the possession of the premises and who remained in possession until Juno 12th, 1869, the respondent Phelps, under a parol contract with Fellowes, commenced furnishing materials for the construction and repairs of the buildings and fences. On that day he delivered on the premises 5064 feet of ceiling boards, about two-thirds of which were used in the construction of the fences, and the remainder in the construction of a barn on the premises. Those used in the barn were subsequently, and before using, removed from the premises for storage. This was rendered necessary by the fact that after commencing to repair the barn, it was decided to remove it, and build a new one. On the 13th of May Phelps made a small charge for cartage, and on the 15th commenced labor by his employees, which continued from day to day until after the 12th day of June following. The labor prior to June 12tli was on the fence, and up to that day the labor performed, and the materials furnished, amounted to about $800. The fence enclosed the whole premises, and was joined to the barn, the barn standing in the line of the fence. No work had been done on the buildings up to June 12th, except that Phelps during that time on two occasions took levels for a drain leading from the dwelling house to the sewer, and finding that the dráin was being laid too high, he directed it to bo relaid and lowered, which was done. The drain was not laid by men in Phelps’s employ, and it did not appear by whose request he performed that service. But it was done in behalf o\\'f Fellowes, and was beneficial to him as proprietor. No specific charge was made for this work nor for any other service performed by him in person. His compensation was agreed to be a charge of fifty cents per day for each workman employed, and a commission not exceeding ten per cent, on his disbursements. Phelps continued to furnish labor and materials for the buildings until November 29th, 1870. His certificate of lien was filed January 27th, 1871. There was no written contract between Phelps and Fellowes in respect to the work and materials, but there was an oral agreement, made before the commencement of the woi\\'k, that the work should be done by the day, and that the materials should be furnished from time to time, as needed or requested. There was no understanding as to the amount of labor, to be performed, or materials to be supplied, but the same was to depend upon the directions given by Fellowes from time to time; but it was understood that the whole job was to be done by Phelps. The amount actually expended in work and materials was largely in excess of what either party anticipated .at the commencement. Before commencing the work Phelps made and furnished to Fellowes an estimate of the probable expenses of carrying out the plan as it then lay in the mind of Fellowes. The whole amount expended on the premises by Phelps, exclusive of interest, was about $33,000, of which about $3,600 was profit. Phelps supposed that Fellowes would acquire a good and unincumbered title. On the lltli day of June, 1869, Fellowes having previously applied to the Middletown Savings Bank for a loan on the premises, a committee consisting of the president and one of the directors of the bank, visited and examined the property, to judge of its value. On that day two men were at work on the fence. The fence was nearly completed and new, but the premises generally were in a dilapidated condition. The condition of the buildings and fence, and the fact that work was being done on the premises, were obvious and could hardly have failed to attract the attention of any one who was examining the property with reference to its value. Both gentlemen however testified that they did not know that any work was going on. But the committee found from all the circumstances, either that they knew of the work at the time, and had forgotten it at the time they testified, or else that their not knowing of it was the result of inattention, and therefore found that they had, knowledge, actual or constructive. They had no knowledge of the arrangement between Phelps and Fellowes, although they understood that Fellowes intended to make extensive repairs. On the 12th of June the deeds were delivered. The deeds from Smith to H. & S. Bissell, and from Ií. & S. Bissell to Fellowes, and the mortgage from Fellowes to the Middletown Savings Bank, were delivered to the respective grantees, in the order above named, and at the same interview; and the avails of the loan were delivered by the bank to Fellowes, and by Fellowes to the Bissells, and the Bissells paid a part thereof to Smith, at the same time, the whole being substantially one transaction. All the deeds were taken to the town clerk’s office for record, by Mr. Camp, the treasurer of the savings bank, at the same time. Mr. Camp knew, at the time he took the mortgage deed, that the avails of the loan were to be used by Fellowes to pay for the property mortgaged; but it was not found that he or any other officer of the bank knew it before. The bank had already agreed, provided the title was satisfactory, to make the loan, without any knowledge of the purpose of Fellowes in taking the same, and without any knowledge that the proceeds were to be applied in payment to the Bissells. Mr. Gamp brought the money to Hartford to make the loan on the day the same was made, without any such knowledge, and only learned of the application by being present when it was made. This application was not a condition of making the loan, and had no material relation thereto. The officers of the bank had no knowledge of the title to the property until the 12th day of June, when Mr. Camp caused an examination to be made, and found that Mr. Smith had a good title, and that deeds from him to the Bissells, and from the Bissells to Fellowes, made a clear and unincumbered title in Fellowes on the records. No officer of the bank had any actual knowledge of any claims of lien at the time the money was advanced; the bank however had such knowledge on that subject as may be implied from the facts herein stated. The amount loaned by the savings bank was $30,000, in two notes, one of $20,000, secured only by the mortgage, and one of $10,000, secured by the mortgáge, and also by the signature of Harvey Seymour as surety. The amount due to Phelps, with interest to the 1st day of January, 1875, is $39,666.89. The value of the property is $50,000. Upon these facts the case was reserved for the advice of this court. Culver and C. E. Perkins, for the petitioner. 1. The statute giving a lien to builders applies only to cases -where the claim is against the owner of the property. This statute is to be strictly construed. Chapin v. Persse & Brooks Paper Works, 30 Conn., 474. The language is indefinite ; any person who has a claim against any one, would be within its letter, but it has always been construed as intending only a claim against the owner, and the legislature in 1874 added a provision to this effect, which however was only declaratory. Spaulding v. Thompson Ecclesiastical Society, 27 Conn., 577. In section 11, the statute provides that sub-contractors shall not have a lien unless they give notice to the owner, and in section 12 it provides that the liens all together shall not he valid to a greater extent than the whole sum agreed to be paid by the owner\"of the land and buildings. Such a construction was given to similar language in the statutes of Massachusetts and Maine with regard to mechanics’ liens. Thaxter v. Williams, 14 Pick, 49; Conner v. Lewis, 16 Maine, 268. The only question therefore is, whether there was any thing in the relation in which Mr. Fellowes stood to the property from which the law will regard him as owner. It is claimed that because he had a contract for purchase from another person, who had another contract of purchase from the owner, this gives him such an interest in the property as enables him to create liens as if he were the legal owner. But it is most unreasonable to suppose that the statute intended to give to any person to whom I have, on certain conditions, agreed to sell my property, a right to expend money upon it in improvements, which are to become a charge on the property and which I may have to pay. While the owner retains the title to the property he and he only can incumber it. It would be as reasonable to say that Fellowes could mortgage the property as to say that he could create liens on it. The mechanic is bound to know or find out what the title of his employer is. He must show a valid claim, arising from a contract made with some person who has power to contract. Unless Plielps had a claim against Mr. Smith, the owner, he could have no lien even against him. But the case becomes very much stronger when we come to the case of a third person loaning money on the strength of the title. The owner knows when a contract to convey is made, but a creditor goes to the records, and he there finds what incumbrances are existing; and the only way in which he can find out anything about mechanics’ liens is to go to the person whom the records show is the owner. If that person has created no liens, the creditor has no means of further information, and has a right to take it for granted that there are no liens. 2. It is believed that in no case like the present has a mechanic’s lien been preferred to the mortgage. On the contrary it has been always held that a mortgage to secure the purchase money, given at the time of the purchase, takes priority of liens for work done for the purchaser before he obtains the legal title, and this even where the purchaser was in possession. One of the earliest cases is Thaxter v. Williams, 14 Pick., 49, in 1833. It was exactly the case at bar, and it was held that a person in possession under a bond for a deed could not create a lien,\\'and especially that a deed to him and a mortgage made at the same time to obtain the purchase money, did not give him such a seizin that the lien attached. This case has never been overruled, but has been affirmed, and is held to be a leading case every where. In 1854 the case of Metcalf v. Hunnewell, 1 Gray, 297, was decided. At that time the statute gave a lien to a mechanic if the work was done for any person who had contracted with the owner of the land for its purchase. It was held that this did not extend to cover work done for a person who had contracted with another person who had a contract with the owner. In 1870 the case of Hayes v. Fessenden, 106 Mass., 231, was decided, in which it was held that a person who had contracted for the purchase of land could not charge it with a lien, although the owner knew of the erection of the building and did not object to it. Campbell’s Appeal, 36 Penn. S. R., 247, is exactly in point. A person contracting for the purchase of an estate, and in possession, erected buildings. When the contract was executed, at the same time and as part of the same transaction the land was mortgaged to a third person for part of the purchase money, and it was held that such a mortgage took precedence of the lien, as a matter of equitable right, as, without such mortgage, the mechanic would have had no interest in the property on which his lien could have attached. See also Stoner v. Neff, 50 Penn. S. R., 258; Zeigler’s Appeal, 69 id., 471; Weldon v. Gibbon, 2 Phila. R., 340 ; O’Conner v. Warner, 4 Watts & Serg., 227 ; Conner v. Lewis, 16 Maine, 268; Gray v. Carleton, 35 id., 481; Bridwell v. Clark, 39 Misso., 170; Scales v. Griffin, 2 Doug. (Mich.), 54 ; Virgin v. Brubaker, 4 Nevada, 31; Guy v. Carriere, 5 Cal., 512 ; Underhill v. Corwin, 15 Ill., 556 ; Jersey Company v. Davidson, 29 N. Jersey Law R., 415; National Bank v. Sprague, 20 N. Jersey Eq. R., 14; Harsh v. Morgan, 1 Kansas, 293 ; Kenny v. Gage, 33 Verm., 302. 3. But Phelps’s lien did not originate before our mortgage. All that he did was to build a fence, and to furnish material to repair the barn, which material was afterwards removed from the premises. Building a fence does not give a lien. It is not a building, or an appurtenance of a building. It is appurtenant only to the land. Webster defines “ appurtenance” as “ small buildings connected with the house, such as barn, wash-house,” &c. Still less does the fact that a few hundred feet of boards were brought there to repair the barn, and then were taken away again when it was decided not to repair it, but to build a new one, make the whole of the work relate back to the time when the boards were first brought there. The fact that Phelps still intended to use them on the premises, makes no difference. It is the time when they are actually furnished for the construction that fixes the date. And it will hardly be claimed that because Phelps took a level to have a drain properly laid, that act gave him a lien. All such acts are much too small and immaterial to deprive us of our actual cash advance of thirty thousand dollars, being the whole amount of the purchase-money paid. We ought certainly to stand in as good a position as Mr. Smith, the owner ; and can there be any question but that if he had sold, and taken back a mortgage for the purchase-money, his mortgage would have stood before the lien ? There was no contract for building entered into between Fellowes and Phelps. It was only agreed that when the work was done the latter should do it by days’ works. It was not expected or intended that work on the house should be commenced until after Fellowes had purchased the property and got possession. B. I). Hubbard and H. G. B,obinson, for the respondent Phelps. The lien of Phelps must prevail unless the petitioners shall establish one of three things:—1st. That the mechanic’s lien did not attach until after June 12tli, because the labor and materials were not such as the statute protects; or 2d. That it is subordinate to the mortgagee on account of an incidental application by the mortgagor of the money lent, toward paying for the premises; or 3d. That it did not attach at all, because there has never been sufficient estate for it to attach to, as against the mortgagee. 1. The labor performed and materials provided before and on the 12th day of June were of such a character as to make a lien upon the premises. The place which Mr. Fellowes designed to occupy as his homestead was in decay, and its thorough reconstruction was determined upon, including an appropriate fence, the enlargement of the barn and stable, and the renovation of the dwelling house. For-this entire job the skill and services of Phelps were engaged upon a commission. The magnitude of the contract can be seen by noticing that his disbursements amount to 133,000. The excess of the cost above the estimates is not strange. This is a common experience. The entireness of the contract is held to be significant in determining what is the subject of lien. Yearsley v. Flanigan, 22 Penn. S. R., 489. There have been cases which hold that fences about country lots are not included in the term “ building,” as they certainly are not in the term “ dwelling-house.” Though in Massachusetts it has been held that “ building or structure ” includes a city fence. Rathbun v. Hayford, 5 Allen, 406. But our statute includes not only buildings and- dwelling-house, but “ any of their appurtenances. ” There can be no doubt that a city fence, skirting the whole lot, and in a line with the face of the barn, and “ adjoined to the barn,” exhausting nearly 3,400 feet of ceiling boards, is to be included as an appurtenance of the dwelling-house and buildings repaired. In addition to the labor upon the fences Phelps also took levels for drains from the dwelling-house before the 12th of June, and also furnished, on the 1st of May, a large quantity of material, 5,064 feet of ceiling boards, about one-third of which went into the barn. 2. The application which Mr. Fellowes happened to make of the money did not subordinate the lien of the mechanic, to the mortgage. In this part of the case, the petitioners rely upon the supposed lien which has been, by some courts, held to be in vendors for their purchase money, and which some of the courts have also said may continue where a mortgage is taken by the vendor, and may even pass over from the vendor to another who provides funds for the purpose of making the purchase. We submit that this principle has no force against the mechanic in this case, for two reasons.—1st. The doctrine of vendors’ liens lias found no especial favor in Connecticut. Dean v. Dean, 6 Conn., 288; Meigs v. Dimock, 6 Conn., 463; Atwood v. Vincent, 17 Conn., 583.—2d. If the\\'doctrine were to be recognized here at all, we submit that it would not apply to a case like this. In the cases where the principle is recognized, and where the lien is held to accrue to the benefit of a third person advancing the purchase money; there has always been a previous purpose, on his part, to furnish the money for the purchase. And we submit that, neither by authority nor by logic, can it for a moment be claimed that any person who lends money and takes a mortgage upon the borrower’s real estate as security, becomes possessed of a vendor’s interest in the land, if only the mortgagor happens to apply the whole or some part of the loan in payment for the land. A lender is at liberty to accept such security as he pleases. In this case the petitioners took the security of the land as it was at the time the deed was delivered, and the additional guarantee of Mr. Seymour; if they had wished for an additional vendor’s lien, they should at least have insisted that their funds should go to the purchase. But the court finds that this application of money had no material relation to the loan, and that the only knowledge which the agent of the company had of the fact was by his actual presence when it occurred. 3» There was sufficient estate to sustain the lien before the delivery of the mortgage. It is true that in one state, where the lien law ran only against the owner of the land, the court held the term to designate the owner of the legal estate. But we are not embarassed by any such limitation in our statute. The legislature dropped the word “ proprietor ” from the act, and has made the lien effectual to attach to any interest in the land. Mr. Fellowes’s equitable estate at the commencement of Phelps’s services became merged in his legal estate on the 12th of June. In some states where the lien was only against “ owners,” the courts have hgld, in just such a case as this, that when the equitable estate in fact became afterward merged into the legal estate, the date of the attachment of the lien related back to the beginning of the services, when there was only the equitable estate. Hollín v. Cross, 45 N. York, 766. But at most such a claim as we are now considering could operate against us only to the extent of a few hundred dollars. The court has found that Phelps was at work on the very day when Mr. Fellowes received his deed, and if never before, his lien then attached, and the amount of his bill, less the |800 already expended, comes in before the mortgage. In this branch of the case it is not to be overlooked that conveyances of interests, merely equitable, in land, are protected by our statutes. Revision of 1875, tit. 18, sec. 18. Nor should we forget that notice of liens must be regarded by parties having to do with the land. Boswell v. Goodwin, 31 Conn., 84. And the finding shows that there was notice to these petitioners of the commencement of the improvements upon this property. The petitioners claim in this branch of the argument that the doctrine of instantaneous seisin excludes our right of lien, or at least subordinates it to the mortgage. But we insist that the doctrine applies only to cases where a single act or conveyance confers and divests the title; and that its application depends upon whether there is ever any beneficial seisin in the party. • Blackstone (2 Com., 132,) illustrates it by the case of “ the seisin of the husband for a transitory instant only, when the same act which gives him the estate conveys it* also out of him again, as where by a fine land is granted to a man and he immediately renders it back by the same fine.” The early cases in Massachusetts thus recognize the doctrine. Thus, in Holbrook v. Finney, 4 Mass., 568, which is a leading case upon the subject, Ch. J. Parsons says the seisin for an instant is where a party, by the same act by which he acquires the seisin, parts with it. The whole subject, as viewed by the courts of that state, is explained in the case of Hazleton v. Lesure, 9 Allen, 24, where it is expressly admitted that if there is “ a beneficial seisin, however short,” this doctrine does not apply. There must have been a beneficial seisin in Mr. Followes unless, at the time he received the deed, he received it upon some trust, or for some use other than his own. The principle is thus clearly stated by a modern text writer. “ The settled doctrine is that when property passes through a man without his having paid for it and with an understanding that he is at once to secure the payment by a mortgage on the property itself, no right vests in him, except that which is subject to such payment.” “ The delivery of the deed and the delivery of the mortgage are but one transaction, done in performance of the same agreement. Their operation is contemporaneous and connected, and affords no opportunity for the liens of creditors to attach.” Phillips on Mech. Liens, § 246. There is no intimation in the finding of any such trust or use. On the contrary they arc both negatived by the finding that the application of the money had no relation to the loan. If the doctrines of vendors’ liens and instantaneous seisin are to apply to conveyances which have only such an accidental relation, the mechanics’ lien law will be a failure. If it shall be ruled that whenever the owner becomes invested with a perfect title and the mortgagee takes his deed of mortgage at the same interview, the builders and laborers are thereby deprived of the\\' protection of this statute, then the statute is made unreliable except in cases of perfect title, which the statute most evidently did not contemplate or require. If the doctrine of a vendor’s lien to its full extent is recognized by our courts, the mechanic is deprived of the protection of this most equitable statute against any mortgagee, no matter what the date of his mortgage, any part of whose loan is in fact, by accident or design, applied to the purchase of the property.',\n",

       "  'case_summary': \"Lydia Erdman v. Emanuel Gottshall, Appellant. Negligence — Trespass by driven cattle — Province of court and jury. One driving domestic animals along the public highway is bound to observe due care, and if, notwithstanding, they escape from the driver without negligence, and go upon private ground he is not responsible provided lie removes them within a reasonable time; and what is reasonable time must depend upon all the circumstances. There being no evidence of such negligence sufficient to warrant ils submission, it is the duty of the court to instruct for defendant. Cattle — • Trespass— Party fence — Question for jury. The owner of cattle kept upon a farm is bound to keep them from tres^ passing on his neighbor’s land, but where a parly fence enters into consideration, while the duty is imposed on the owner of cattle to make it sufficient to restrain a tendency to roam, yet the matter of sufficiency of such a fence is a question for the jury. Argued Oct. 25, 1898. Appeal, No. 110, Oct. T., 1898, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. Northumberland Co., Feb. T., 1896, No. 11, on verdict for plaintiff. Before Rice, P. J., Reeder, W. W. Porter and W. D. Porter, JJ. Reversed. Appeal from judgment of justice. Before Savidge, P. J. It appears from the record and evidence that this action arose over two acts of alleged trespass by defendant’s cows. The first occurred while the cows were being driven along the public highway by their escaping into a cornfield of the plaintiff opening upon the highway. The second occurred when the cows passed out of an inclosed pasture (by reason of two of the fence rails being removed) across another field of the defendant and through a defective line fence into the plaintiff’s cornfield. Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $12.60. Defendant appealed. Errors assigned were (1) refusing defendant’s point, which point and answer thereto are as follows : “If the jury believe the evidence on the part of the defendant, that he had a good and sufficient fence to fence his cattle in, and he was not guilty of negligence, then the verdict must be for the defendant. Anr swer: I have already instructed you otherwise, gentlemen, and I refuse this point.† (2) In charging the jury as follows: “ These cattle escaped upon two occasions. According to' the defense at one time the children were taking them to the pasture and they escaped, and it is alleged by the plaintiff trespassed upon her land and destroyed her corn. It is not a question as to whether there was negligence on the part of the owner of the cattle in trusting them to those boys or not; if they did escape from their control, got upon this plaintiff’s land and destroyed her corn, the defendant is liable for whatever damages she sustained.” (3) In charging the jury as follows: “ It has been contended on the part of the defense that all that is required now of the owner of cattle, upon whom the duty is cast of fencing them in, is that he maintain a sufficient fence. I am not inclined to that view of the case. ' I believe he is bound to fence them in at all hazards; that the right of action grows out of the trespass to the land of the party complaining. This would address itself to your understanding of what would be right under circumstances such as these, because the owner of cattle has it within his power to keep them up. If the cattle are vicious and breachy, he knows it, is bound to know it, and having that knowledge he should provide such fence as is necessary to keep in the kind of cattle he owns, the kind of cattle he undertakes to keep. If they are not vicious, but ordinary cattle, and it turned out that they escape, then it would follow, of course, that the fence was not sufficient, even for the ordinary purpose of keeping in domestic animals. But in any event he is bound to keep them up so they may not trespass upon his neighbor’s land. It is not a question, in my judgment, whether his fence be what the jury might regard as a sufficient fence, or not; but I say to you he is absolutely bound to keep them within his own close, upon his own premises.” (4) In charging the jury as follows : “Now you will take this case and return such a verdict as you think will do justice between these parties. The plaintiff is entitled to recover, if at all, — and there is no question but what she is entitled to recover for the damage done on the first occasion if you find the cattle trespassed there and destroyed some of her corn — for so much damage as she actually sustained.” J. W. Gillespie, with him Lewis Dewart, for appellant. The Act of April 4, 1889, P. L. 27, which repealed the 1st section of the Act of 1700,1 Sm. L. 13, did not repeal the Act of April 11, 1842, P. L. 62, because there is no inconsistency between the two; hence when the Supreme Court in its opinion by Mr. Justice Dean, in Barber v. Mensch, held that by repeal, the rights of landowners and owners of cattle are left as they were at common law before 1700, it clearly meant the repeal of the first section of the act of 1700. It is to be remembered that the Supreme Court in Barber v. Mensch decided that the act of 1889 did not repeal the act of 1842, hence the repeal had relation only to the first section of the act of 1700. We submit, that the rule laid down in Barber v. Mensch is the law controlling this case, and that it was error in the learned court below to negative defendant’s point and practically give binding instructions to the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiff leaving to them only the amount of the verdict, as complained of in the third assignment: Barber v. Mensch, 157 Pa. 390; Dolph v. Ferris, 7 W. & S. 367; Ziegler v. House, 1 Dist. Rep. 609. Judge Cooley, in his excellent work on torts, gives what • we believe to be a common sense view of the question under discussion, viz : “ If one is driving his domestic animals along the public highway, he is bound to observe due care, and if, notwithstanding he is guilty of no negligence, they escape from him and go upon private grounds, he is not responsible, provided he removes them within a reasonable time. And what is a reasonable time must depend upon all the circumstances : ” Cooley on Torts (1880, ed.), 341; The Tonawanda R. R. Co. v. Munger, 5 Denio, 255; Bush v. Brainard, 1 Cowen, 78, 84, note; 6 Wait’s Actions and Defenses, 71. There is no evidence in the case showing that the defendant was guilty of negligence either in not providing a “ sufficient'” fence to keep his cattle in, or in intrusting them in the care of boys to drive to pasture; while on the other hand the evidence on the part of the defendant clearly proved that the fence was “ sufficient.” The court below took both of these questions practically from the jury. S. B. Boyer, for appellee. It is too well settled to admit of the least doubt, that a man is not only answerable for his own trespass, but likewise for that of his cattle. For if by his neglectful keeping, they stray upon the land of another, and thev there tread down his neighbor’s herbage and spoil his corn or his field, this is an injury for which the owner is liable to be sued in trespass: Gregg v. Gregg, 55 Pa. 227. January 18, 1899: In a case stated, Thompson v. Kyler, 9 Pa. C. C. Reps. 205, Judge Mayer, of Clinton county, said: “ The fence law of 1700 having been repealed by the act of 1889, the common law rule, requiring every one to keep his cattle within his own close, applies in all cases where the act of 1700 was before the only law.” The other question raised on the trial was in relation to the line fence, between the parties. The maintaining of line fences is governed by the Act of March 11, 1842, P. L. 62. If the line fence was not in a proper condition the defendant had two remedies, one was to proceed under the act of 1842, supra, or else make his own fence on his own ground, as ruled by the late Justice Mercur, in Smith v. Johnson, 76 Pa. 191, and cases cited.\",\n",

       "  'case_summary': \"William P. Davis, Respondent, v. The Hannibal & St. Joseph Railway Company, Appellant. Kansas City Court of Appeals, November 23, 1885. 1. Railroads — Requirement to Erect and Maintain Fences. — The statutes of this state (sections 5651, 5652, Revised Statutes), not only imposes the obligation on railroad companies to erect a lawful fence, in certain cases, and defines what shall constitute a lawful fence ; but it also requires them, to maintain such fence thereafter. 2. - Duties in the Nature oe a Police Regulation — Degree of Care Required. — This duty imposed by the statute on the rail- x'oads is in tlie nature of a police regulation, and is designed as a means of greater secm-ity to the lives and limbs of passengers on the trains, and also for the prevention of injuries to animals liable to be about the track, Therefore, as the corporation must maintain the fence to such an important end, the law exacts of it a degree of care and vigilance in looking after its fences, commensurate with the peril to life and property. 3. - Owners of Stock not Required to Restrain. — In this state the owners of stock are not required to keep them up or restrain them fimu going about railroad tracks. Gorman v. R. R. Go., 26 Mo. 441 ; Busby v. R. R. Go., 81 Mo. 43. Appeal from Clay Circuit Court, Hon. G-eo. W. Dunn, Judge. Affirmed. The case and facts are stated in the opinion. Thomas E. Turney and Strong & Mosman, for the appellant. I. Proof of negligence in failing to repair, after notice of the defect, or of negligence in failing to discover it seasonably and to repair it within a reasonable time thereafter, was necessary to entitle plaintiff to recover. Clardy v. Ry. Co., 73 Mo. 578; Slier. & Redf. on Negligence, sect. 459 ; Fitterling v. Ry. Co., 79 Mo. 508. There was a total failure of evidence of the negligence charged. II. Plaintiff’s evidence disclosed contributory negligence, and, therefore, he should not recover. BuescMng v. Gas Co., 73 Mo. 229; Grebble v. Sioux City, 38 Iowa 390 ; Carey v. AT. W. Co., 43 Wis. 682. III. The motion for new trial should have been sustained. Cases, supra. D. C. Allen, for the respondent. I. The circuit court committed no error in refusing to give instructions asked by defendant. They assume facts which were not proved, and inferences from them not justified even if proof had been made, while the evidence is opposed both to the assumption and inferences. II. The question, is, whether the failure to repair the defect in the fence, for two, perhaps four weeks prior to the accident, was not in itself, a sufficient evidence of negligence to warrant recovery. It is the railroad company’s duty to construct lawfully as well as to maintain lawfully, and it cannot permit a defect to remain unrepaired for an unreasonable length of time. The court by its findings held the time unreasonable. Glardy v. JRy. Go., 73 Mo. 376; Vineyard v. R. R. Go., 80 Mo. 92; Sher. & Redf. on Negligence (2 Ed.) 533, sect. 459. III. The evidence shows no contributory negligence on the part of the respondent. It was not negligence to keep the steer in his enclosed field, whether he knew of the defect in the fence or not. Rev. Stat., sect. 809; Atchison D. Ry. Go., 13 Cent. Law Jour. 249. IY. The defect in the fence was not caused by the act of God. What happened could have been foreseen and prevented. Defendant failed to either erect or maintain such fence as by law it was required to do. Y. It was established that defendant’s railroad passed through plaintiff’s enclosed field; that defendant failed to erect and maintain such a fence as the law requires ; and that plaintiff’s steer strayed upon defendant’ s track and was killed by its train for want of such fence; that evidence without more made out a prima facie case for plaintiff.

Appeal from the Circuit Court for St. Johns county. STATEMENT. Appellee recovered judgment in an action of ejectment brought against appellants, (husband and wife,) for a piece of land in the City of St. Augustine and described in the declaration as follows : A strip of land being the east end or portion of a certain lot conveyed by Lizzie Andreu and Michael Andreu, her husband, to Mildred Watkins by deed dated April 5, 1884, recorded in Book CC, on page 435, etc., of the public records of St. Johns county, commencing at the southwest corner of the said lot on the north side of Mulberry street, being twenty feet west of the place where the old line of fence stood, which, up to the time of the said conveyance, marked the dividing line between the land of said Mildred Watkins and said Lizzie Andreu, thence northerly forty-seven feet, thence east five feet, thence southerly parallel to the first line forty-seven feet to Mulberry street, thence west along Mulberry street, to the place of beginning, and containing two hundred and thirty-five square feet. The plea was the general issue. To maintain her action the plaintiff introduced in evidence the following instruments: A deed from LucyB. Abbott, dated May 17th, 1883, conveying to plaintiff all that certain lot of land in the City of St. Augustine, described as follows : Beginning at the intersection of Mulberry\\'and Water streets from the point northerly along said Water street one hundred and fifty- eight feet, thence south forty-seven feet to Mulberry street, thence eastwardly along north side of Mulberry street one hundred and fifty-eight feet to beginning corner, and is bounded on north side by land of said Lucy B. Abbott, south by Mulberry street, east by Water street, and west by lot of Andreu, and is in that part of the City of St. Augustine known as the North City, and conveyed to said Lucy B. Abbott by I. W. Starke, on the 28th day of August, 1872, and recorded in Book I, page 565 ; “also reference to map on file in County Clerk’s office of the Mary Ann Davis tract, to which reference may be had.” A deed dated April 5th, 1884, from Mrs. Andreu and her husband conveying to the plaintiff “a strip of land being the east end or portion of a certain lot deeded to party of first part by Lucy B. Abbott, by deed dated June 23d, A. D. 1882, recorded in Book AAA, page 123, the west half having been sold to Dora Benet, the piece now intended to be conveyed by this deed measures as follows : Beginning at the southeast corner of said lot which is now the dividing line between this lot and the lot of Mildred Watkins, thence northerly forty-seven feet to the northeast corner of said lot, thence west twenty feet, thence south and parallel with the east side forty-seven feet to Mulberry street, thence eastwardly along Mulberry street twenty feet to the place of beginning, the front and rear being twenty feet east end and the east and west sides forty-seven feet deep.” Then follows a diagram thus: Miss Watkins, the plaintiff, testified: That the dividing line between herself and the Andreus was at the time of their conveyance to her, marked by a fence ; Andreu’s lot was enclosed by a fence on the east; that this fence was understood between them as dividing their lots ; that she had not received possession of the twenty feet conveyed to her by the Andreus ; that they had given her only fifteen feet and one inch; that the fence was moved after their conveyance to her; that Andreu said he had only given witness this quantity; that the fence is now on the same line where Andreu moved it, fifteen feet and one inch from where it stood, so far as witness knows. It was moved several months after she bought; that they agreed to let the fence remain for a while, as she had a crop on the land. She could not swear that anyone measured the distance between where the fence now stands, and the line where it used to stand. It was one hundred and fifty-eight feet from the line of Water street to where the line of Andreu’s fence stood ; that Andreu was at the time of the deed from Miss Abbott to witness, in possession of his lot and his fence was there—the fence that was understood to make the east line of this lot. On cross-examination she testified that she had put up a fence on the east side of her lot on the line of Water street but had never fenced it on Mulberry street. James L. Colee, a witness in behalf of plaintiff, testified that some six weeks ago he measured the Watkins lot and the adjacent lots as they stand, and made a plat “showing the lots as they now stand, and as they stood several years ago.” The red lines show the lots as they stood at the time Miss Watkins and Mr. Benet bought; the black lines as they now are and shown by the fences- The present fence stands fifteen feet and six inches from where the old fence stood. The present fence is now one hundred and seventy-three feet and six inches from Water street. In making my survey I began at the southeast corner of Miss Watkins’ lot. The plat was introduced but is not necessary to an understanding of the case. On cross-examination he said that he began his survey at the southwest corner of Water and Mulberry streets, and measured along Mulberry street one hundred and fifty-eight feet, and drove a stake; did not measure from Orange street; that he accepted as the east line of Miss Watkins’ lot, her fence built on the line of Water street; that he \"went” according to her deed; cannot say when she bought; that he did not have any data as to where the fence then stood; took Mrs. Benet’s statement and that of Mrs. Andreu as to where the old fence stood. Upon re-direct examination he said that Mrs. Andreu could not show him where the old fence stood; they said their fence on Orange street was moved back five feet, and that it was done to straighten the street, and that they intended to have the same amount of land they bought from Miss Abbott. Could not say if Andreu said the fence was moved in from Orange street before or after the sale by him to Miss Watkins. The testimony in behalf of the defendant is as follows : A deed from Miss Lucy B. Abbott, dated June 23d, 1882, recorded in Book AAA, page 123, of St. Johns county records, and conveying to Mrs. Andreu “all that certain piece or parcel of land in the North City, lying and being in the City of St. Augustine, * * described as follows : Bounded on the north by lands of the party of the first part, on the south by Mulberry street, on the west by Orange street, and on the east by the lands of the party of the first part, and measuring on the north and south sides one hundred and fifty feet, and on the east and west ends forty-seven feet, as by reference to the map of the North City of the Mary Ann Davis tract filed in the office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court of St. Johns county, Florida, May 14th, 1877; and is part of the same land that was conveyed to party of the first part by John W. Starke, by deed dated August 28th, 1872, recorded in Book T, page 505. The map mentioned in this deed was also introduced in evidence. Miss Lucy B. Abbott testified that she was grantor in the deeds to Miss Watkins and Mrs. Andreu; that she had owned the property since 1873. VanNess and witness owned the whole Mary Ann Davis tract; that upon a survey made of that part of the tract covered by the property in controversy a few years since, she was present, and the old stake set on the line of Water street was found; that Miss Watkins’ fence on the east end of her lot is on the line of Water street as plotted and as found by said survey; that the distance by the original survey of the tract from Water street to Orange street is three hundred feet; that at the time Andreu built his fence, witness could not get a surveyor to locate the lines of his lot and he built his fence five feet into Orange street. William Mickler deposed that he knew the location of the streets in North City, and the location of the land in litigation. That he had lately made a survey and\\'measurements of the blocks lying between Water and Orange streets, and found the distance between these streets measured along Mulberry street to be 302 feet; that Orange and Water streets are each thirty feet wide at Mulberry .street; and Miss Watkins’ fence on Water street is on a line with the other fences on that street. That he did not measure the lots but only the blocks. That the fence of the Benet lot on Orange street is on a line with the other fences on that side of the street. If the fence on west end of Benet’s lot was moved five feet to the west, it would reduce the width of Orange street to twenty-five feet. The other facts are stated in the opinion.\\' Rude & Dewhurst for Appellants. Fleming & Daniel for Appellee. “It is most obvious that the original and best evidence of what lands the parties to the deed intended to pass is that land which was viewed out and actually run and marked at the time the trade was consummated. This is the land appropriated.” Malone on Real Property Trials, 228. So, too, it is proper to show that this fence was recognized as the division line between the parties at the time of the conveyance to show what was intended to be conveyed where the starting point commences at the division line. “Extrinsic evidence is always admissible to explain the calls of a deed, for the purpose of their application to the subject-matter and thus give effect to the deed.” Malone R.

P. Trials, 333. Rockwell vs. Adams, 6 Wend., 467. A clear puma facie case was made by the plaintiff when she rested her testimony, to-wit: that at least four feet six inches on Mulberry street by forty-seven feet deep of the land conveyed to her by the defendants was by them withheld from her, and we cannot see how this prima facie case is disturbed or weakened by the evidence of the defendants. Miss Abbott testifies that from Water street to Orange street is 300 feet and that Andreu built his fence five feet into Orange street. Mickler, a surveyor, says that he made a survey of the block and found the distance between said streets 302 feet, and gives the width of several streets. How that testimony militates against the plaintiff’s case, we fail to appreciate. But even if there was a conflict of evidence, the jury considered it and found for the plaintiff, which verdict this Court could not disturb, on the evidence, without, in our opinion, a violation of the uniform line of decisions running through its Reports; that is, that if there is evidence to sustain a verdict it will not be disturbed, unless the weight of evidence is so clearly against the verdict .as to warrant the conclusion that the jury were actuated by improper motives. “Boundary is a question of fact, or at least of law and fact, and is decided by the jury and not the Court, and questions of boundary, like other questions of fact, depend upon their own particular circumstances, when every shade of evidence and even the most minute circumstances, may produce its effect. Malone, 240. This disposes of the first and second grounds of error. We shall now consider the charges of the Court, as to which error is assigned. The second charge given at plaintiff’s request is objected to, which is as follows : “Where a person has sold land upon a certain line pointing it out at the time and induced another to buy it, he is estopped to deny that it is the line so pointed out, as against the party to whom he sells,” In support of this charge we cite: Malone R. P. Trials, 242, Note. 41 N. H., 380. 51 Me., 575. Wilson vs. Hudson, 8 Ver., 398. Boyd vs. Graves, 4 Wheat, 513. The third charge given at plaintiff’s request assigned as error, is as follows : “Courses and distances will give wa to a line actually marked on the ground where there is a difference.” To sustain which we cite the following authorities : Malone R. P. Trials, 210-237. It will be seen that lines actually run and comers actually marked at the time of the grant are placed second in importance, while courses and distances are placed fourth. . While it does not appear that the line was run at the time of the conveyance, yet the plaintiff testified that at that time the dividing line was marked by a fence. Qualified as is this charge and the other charges given at the instance of .the plaintiff by those given at the request of defendants, it is not possible that the jury could have been misled; every phase of the case on the part of the defendants was thoroughly guarded by such charges. In this connection we ask particular attention to charges given at defendant’s request, numbered 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9, guarding any departure from the description in the deed. The fourth charge given at the request of the plaintiff assigned as error, is as follows : “If you find from the evidence that the dividing line referred to in the deed from the defendants to the plaintiff was marked by a fence and it was so understood by the parties at that time, the plaintiff is entitled to the full amount of land called for by her deed, measured from such line. And if you find that the defendants withhold from the plaintiff any part of the land so conveyed, you should find a verdict for the plaintiff for sucli part so withheld.” We fail to see what possible objection there can be to this charge. It substantially tells the jury that if any part of the land conveyed to the plaintiff by the defendants is withheld from her by them, she is entitled to a verdict for the part so withheld. The seventh ground of error is, that the Court erred in refusing to charge the jury at defendants’ request as follows : “A plan to which reference is made in a conveyance becomes a part thereof and has the same effect as if its details of courses, distances and monuments were incorporated in the instrument.” This charge sought goes beyond the authority of law. We admit that a plan referred to in a deed has a bearing on the description and is entitled to be given due effect in ascertaining the proper description of the land, but it does not become a part of the deed of conveyance. Though the lower Court may have committed error in giving or refusing charges, yet, where, as in this case, upon the evidence, the jury could not have found any other verdict than that rendered, the Appellate Court will nót reyerse the judgment, as repeatedly ruled by this Court. “When the verdict of a jury accords with the law and the facts of the case, a judgment will not be reversed on account of an erroneous charge to the jury, or a refusal to give instructions which may be appropriate, especially when a correct charge should produce the same result upon the facts. May’s Ex. vs. Seymour, 17 Fla., 725. Even if it be shown that there has been a mistake in the directions of the Court to the jury, or the charge not as specific as thought proper, yet if it be upon a point upon which justice has been done, or the mistake or omission could not have produced a different verdict, a new trial will not be granted.” May & Sloan vs. Gamble, 14 Fla., 467.',\n",

       "  'case_summary': \"Patton, Appellant, v. Hooks. Ejectment — Boundaries—Division line — Adverse possession — ■ Estoppel — Evidence. In an action of ejectment where the issue is to determine the location of a division line described in deeds in partition executed by the predecessors in title of plaintiff and defendant, the latter is entitled to have the case submitted to the jury on the question of adverse possession, where there is evidence 'that shortly after the execution of the deeds, a fence had been constructed having reference to the division line, a part being along it, but not on it, and that for more than twenty-one years before the suit was brought the fence had been maintained, except during a short interval after it had been torn down by plaintiff, but almost immediately rebuilt by defendant. In such a case it is immaterial that plaintiff may have occasionally used a private road, a part of which was on the land in dispute; and in such a case the deeds in the line of title may be sent out with the jury. In an.action of ejectment where the issue is the location of a division line described in deeds of partition executed by predecessors in title of plaintiff and defendant, and where it appears that the deeds had been recorded, and that plaintiff had in no way misled the defendant, it is reversible error for the court to charge in effect that the defendant’s cultivation of the plaintiff’s land without objection on the latter’s part would estop him from asserting title to the property, if such cultivation had not continued for twenty-one years. Argued May 11, 1915. Appeal, No. 71, April T., 1915, by plaintiffs, from judgment of O. P. Armstrong Co., Sept. T., 1912, No. 34, on verdict for defendant in case of William P. Patton, et al., v. John Y. Hooks. Before Rice, P. J., Oklady, Head, Porter, Henderson, Kephart and Trexler,- JJ. Reversed. Ejectment for land in East Franklin Township. Before Painter, P. J. The court charged in part as follows: Robert Campbell, as. shown by the testimony, died June 6,1864, and he appears to have left to survive him, a widow, Phoebe, who afterwards married a man by the name of Russell, and I believe later on again married a man by the name of Montgomery, and also left two children, Sarah J. Campbell, and Esther A. Campbell, Esther A. appears to have changed her name to that of Diamond by marriage, and later on to Claypool. The plaintiffs further show that these heirs of Robert Campbell, by a deed dated in 1884, conveyed to.Henry Myers 28 acres of this land. Some time prior to 1881, and after the death of Robert Campbell, the heirs of Robert Campbell, his widow and two children, divided this tract of land of 109 acres and 67 perches into three, or possibly, four sections, but the fourth section at least does not enter into this title, being the northeastern corner of it. It seems to have been divided by one line running east and west, near the center, and cutting off 57 acres to the south. The upper half of it was divided again by a line running in a slightly northeastern direction. The eastern end of this upper half being the Patton land, and the western half, a portion of the Rebold land. This Patton portion contained 28 acres. We have a deed from the heirs of Robert Campbell to Henry Myers for this half of the upper end, dated September 29, 1881. Henry Myers transferred the same property, by deed dated July 16, 1885, to Thomas Patton. It appears from the.testimony in the case, that Thomas Pat.ton, after he acquired this title, died; I don’t recall the date of his death, but you will remember it. Upon his dying intestate, the title to this property descended to his eight children. These children are all of age, and there are no deceased children, so that the eight children of Thomas Patton now own his interest, and are the plaintiffs in this case. It appears from the evidence in the case that the widow of Thomas Patton is dead, so that the entire title has passed to these plaintiffs. That would vest the title to that 28 acres of land in these present plaintiffs, by means of these several conveyances, and by operation of the intestate laws of this Commonwealth, and they would be entitled to a verdict for the land as described in this suit, if there was nothing else in the case. It seems that this land was divided, and if you will recollect the testimony, and the descriptions in the deeds, it appears that the upper half was divided from the lower half by a line running on a bearing of north 87 degrees west, and it was parallel to the south line of this whole tract of 109 acres. Now, the difficulty in the matter appears to arise in this way. You will also remember, if you can recollect the data in that deed, that the north line of the property transferred, first, to Mrs. Eussell by the heirs of Eobert Campbell, and then later to her son, and later to Hooks; that is, the north line, and it is the line that is common to both tracts, being the north line of Hooks’ property, and the south line of the Patton heirs property, and has the same bearing as appears in the deed from the Campbell heirs to Henry Myers, the predecessor in title of Thomas Patton. I think you can safely start out in saying that at one time that was a straight line running from the western boundary of the Campbell farm to the eastern boundary. [That you may understand, take the top of this desk, here is the dividing line along here, this portion below being the southern portion, is the property owned by Hooks, and the property that would be above this, that would represent the Patton property, and Eebold comes in here, and is divided off by a line running a little in that direction (indicating with his hand,) the length of the line from the river end here to the western end here to that stone corner, being the western end of the Patton property, is 104 rods; I believe the right length is 156 rods, so that it is exactly two-thirds; so that for your purposes, we can start with this point as two-thirds of the distance from here to there (indicating). Now when the deed was made, which is the first deed for the part taken from this Campbell tract, to Mrs. Eussell, the line began and ran on a straight, line from the river to this western boundary. Later on this property was cut off by a deed from the Campbell heirs to Myers, and the bearing of this line on the Patton property, as I have stated, was north 87 degrees west, and it carries the same bearing as appears in the northern line of the Hooks property, so that this line was a straight line at one time, and was common to both properties.] (10) The plaintiffs offered to show that there was a stone corner at this point, being the southwestern corner of that property. That you can take as proven, because it is testified to by both sides of the case, as is also the fixed monument at the extreme western end of that line at a little distance, some 80 or 88 feet east from this corner post, is another stone. Just for what purpose that stone was placed there we are unable to say, but there is some testimony that it was put in in regard to some right-of-way of Eebold, but you gentlemen, will recollect how that was. [The difficulty in this case arises from this fact. The surveyors who testified on behalf of the plaintiffs, started their survey on that rock, and they made a calculation from the bearing in the deed, which threw the line down somewhat farther, from 28 to 32 feet. You can look at it .this way, beginning at a stone up here, at a sharp point, and running down this way to a- stone, and then running down 28 or 32 feet this way, making a wedged shape piece of property like this (illustrating). This is the piece of property that is in dispute in this case.] (ID The first surveyor, Mr. Mast, did not run this line through to the western corner, and when Mr. Lawson was on the witness stand he testified that he afterwards did run this line through, and upon projecting the line through here found that this point along the bearing that he was using was 18 feet north of that stone cornér, and the theory of the plaintiffs is, that that stone corner is wrong, and that the point should be 18 feet north. So his line projected through the point, and this comes to a stone which we have heard a good deal of talk about, as the U. S. stone on the river bank. You can readily understand that the more deflection there would be from the line this way the greater amount of property there would be taken off the Hooks farm here, it would also...... the line on the Eebold. If, as the testimony of the defendant goes to show, a line were projected from that stone at the extreme western end, through this point, then necessarily this line would be a straight line, and must go to the river, or must reach a point further up the river than that found by Mr. Mast and Mr. Lawson. That is the theory of the surveyor of the defendant. There is no dispute at the present time, that this line between Rebold and Patton is the correct line, but we are not concerned with that. [If the theory of the plaintiffs is correct, and their running of this line from the point here, back of the western corner of the Patton property, to a point reached at from 28 to 32 feet away from this point, then there must necessarily be, according to the testimony of Mr. Lawson, there must be a bend in the line instead of the line being a straight line, but that theory of the case, gentlemen, is a question for you. It is one of the questions, not the only question,' but one of the questions for you to decide, just where that line is.] (12) [If, as I have stated to you, you find that the running of this line to that point on the bearing, as testified to by Mr. Lawson and Mr. Mast, reaches a point here at the rock on the Allegheny river, that one with the letters U. S. on it, then the Pattons, or the plaintiffs in this case, would be entitled to your verdict provided that the second theory of the defendant; that is, that of adverse possession for a sufficient length of time tO' entitle him to possession as against the plaintiffs, is disregarded by you. If, on the other hand, you find that the theory of the defendant, that the line originally being a straight line, and beginning at that extreme western end, at a rock, at a monument on that line and passing through this stone here, and reaching a point 28 to 32 feet above, then it would be for the defendant; that is, the defendant would be entitled to your verdict, if he has not es-topped himself in any way from his claim to this land.] (13) [There has been some talk of a draft made by Mr. Gray. That draft, unfortunately, is not before you, and the present surveys have been made from the bearings of the different deeds. We cannot say, and it is impossible to say, that the deeds were drawn from the bearings actually made on the ground by Mr. Gray. But you are safe in starting out with the theory, that at a date, at least as early as 1881, and later in 1885, when the deeds were made to Russell and to Patton, this line was on a bearing of north 87 degrees west, or south 87 degrees Avest, Avhich would be reversing the bearing, and that is as far as the testimony goes. The line has not been changed by consent of any of the property owners.] (14) The bearings, however, differ, which has been accounted for by the different surveyors on the stand, as being caused by the variation in the needle. We all are familiar with that theory, and that brings us to the important feature in this case, and it is covered by one of the points on the part of the defendant in this case, and that is this: that where the marks on the ground on a piece of property do not agree with the bearings given in the deed, rather, the distance, and the variation of the needle, then the bearings as described in the deed must give way to the marks on the ground. That principle is very old, and it is a very proper one, and it has been supported by the higher courts many times. The courts have recognized the fact that mistakes may happen in the deed through scrivener’s fault, or there may be some local attraction that affects the needle, and for other reasons that have been from time to time advanced by our courts. It has become a theory that the fixed monuments on the ground are supposed to be, and indeed are, considered by our courts, to be the best means for locating the true and correct line in the survey of lands. [Unfortunately, we do not have anything in this case except a mark at the end, and the two stones here. There is some testimony that at one time there was a peg put in through down near some laurel bushes at the river, but you, gentlemen, will recollect what that testimony was. There is considerable testimony in regard to a stone marked U. S., and also in regard to another large stone or rock, as it was called, which lay in its natural bed, exposed for some twelve feet. This U. S. stone is described to you by nearly all the witnesses as being about 3x4 feet exposed, and having the letters U. S. engraved on it, and a mark in between the letters. You are men of experience in these matters, and you will have to decide whether that would be, under the testimony of the witnesses, whether that would be a stone Avhich would be known as a corner stone. If that is the case, then you will have to reconcile some of the witnesses. The expert witnesses at least, are united in the fact that you cannot connect this U. S. stone with the middle and the stone comer, because they are not in a straight line. If you connect these two, you go on the Patton heirs sufficient to give to the Hooks farm all the property in dispute. If you disregard that stone, and start from here, and run from the middle stone to the U. S. stone, and project this line back, you not only make a crook in the line, but you take away from Heboid a portion of that property and you give to the Pattons all of the land north of that line, or some 28 or 30 feet down at the river. So you will have to reconcile the testimony as best you can, and say where the true line is.] (15) There is another feature in this case, the defendant has set up title, that this line Avhich runs on a bearing of north 87 degrees west, running from the river through these two stones, is the northern and true boundary of the Hooks property. If it is, as located by the survey of Mr. Aye, then it gives this land in question — if yo-u find that this is the proper line — to the Hooks property, and then your verdict should be for the defendant. There is no evidence to that we recollect of, that there was any assertion of title to that property by the Pat-tons for any sufficient length of time to entitle them to the same. [In addition to that fact, in case you find that this line, as already testified to by Mr. Mast and by Mr. Lawson, is the correct line, and that the property as surveyed is within that line: that is, is north of that line, and between that line and the other property of the Patton heirs, to which there is no dispute, then they could not recover, unless you find that the second defense of the defendant does not avail him in this case; and that second defense is this: The defendant comes in and says that he is entitled to this property, in addition to his record title as shown for the reason that for a period of twenty-one years he has exercised exclusive, continuous, hostile and adverse possession over it.] (16) Now, that is one of the questions that you are to decide before this defendant can sustain his claim on this branch of the case; that is, J. Y. Hooks, to establish this branch of his case, must prove to you, by a preponderance of the testimony, that he and his predecessors in title, have had the actual, continued, uninterrupted, notorious, open, adverse and hostile possession of this property for upwards of twenty-one years, as provided by this act of assembly. That is, in case you find that he has not, on the theory of his survey as to this line, made out his case, and that the line as surveyed for the plaintiffs by Mr. Lawson and Mr. Mast, embraces this land. Even if you find the line to be as claimed by the plaintiffs, they could then not recover possession, nor be entitled to your verdict, unless you find against this second theory of the defendant. If you refuse to adopt this theory as to the boundary line, which would give him the land in dispute, he still claims under the statute of limitations.] (17) [In addition to what we have said in relation to the statute of limitations, it is a well-known principle of law, and it is founded on good common sense, that if a man stands by and sees a stranger make valuable improvements on property that he claims title to, or that he owns, and does not interfere with him, or notify him to that effect, that he is then estopped from afterwards setting up claim of title to that particular piece of property. For instance, if I own a lot, and my neighbor pro.ceeds to put valuable improvements upon a portion of that lot, and I permit him to go ahead and make such valuable improvements without stopping him, I would be estopped under the law from asserting against him any title whatsoever. So in this case if you find from the testimony that the plaintiffs stood by and saw the defendant, Mr. Hooks, make such improvements of value, or make any improvements of value, in the way of buildings, or in the way of fruit trees, or in the cultivation of the land, without objection on their part, then they would be estopped from now asserting title to the property, by reason of their laches in that respect, and that need not be for a period of twenty-one years.] (19) October 11, 1915: Verdict and judgment for defendant.

       "  'case_summary': 'Otis vs. Patrick Cusack and James Cusack. A paroi partition between tenants in common, accompanied by actual possession in accordance therewith, will bind the parties and those claiming through or from them. And where, after such a partition ha.s been made, the parties take separate possession of their respective portions, and one of them contracts with a mechanic to erect a dwelling house on his part, which is built, accordingly, the interest of the party so contracting is of such a nature as to make it the subject of a lien under the mechanics’ lien law, although the title to the whole lot is in the co-tenant. But the co-tenant, who is not a party to the contract with the mechanic, and who has no interest in the work done, is not liable under the contract; nor is his share of the property subject to the builder’s lien. THIS is an appeal from a judgment entered upon the report of a referee in favor of the plaintiff, against the defendants. The action was instituted to enforce a mechanic’s lien, for labor performed and materials furnished by the plaintiff, in erecting a dwelling house at Port Ewen. On the 5th of December, 1859, the Pennsylvania Coal Company conveyed to the defendant, James Cusack, a lot of land at Port Ewen, pursuant to a contract between the company and him.- The defendant, Patrick Cusack, furnished a portion of the money for the purchase of said lot. After such conveyance to James Cusack, he and Patrick made a verbal agreement by which the lot was to be divided, James to have the south and Patrick the north part. James built a house upon the south part of the lot and occupied it. Subsequently a cellar was dug upon the north part of the lot, upon which a house was to bo built for Patrick. After the cellar was finished, a fence was erected across the lot. Patrick entered into an agreement with the plaintiff, by which the plaintiff was to furnish the materials and erect a dwelling house for Patrick upon the north part of said lot. A memorandum of such agreement was made, but not signed by either party. The plaintiff commenced the work, and from time to time, as the- same progressed, received money from Patrick, and when the house was completed Patrick took possession of it and accu-: pied it. Patrick also built a barn upon the same lot, in rear of the house. James was upon the premises a part of the time during the erection of the dwelling house, carried some brick, and did some other work about it, for which he was paid by Patrick. James held the deed of the whole lot purchased of the company. Patrick insisted that the work was unskillfully performed by the plaintiff, and that the materials were defective. Evidence was produced by the respective parties upon that question, and the referee made a deduction from the contract price. The referee reported due the plaintiff $644, including interest, from the defendants, and that the plaintiff had a lien upon the building and the lot upon which it was erected, to the extent of the recovery. Judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiff against the defendants, accordingly, and the defendants separately appealed from such judgment. Lawton & Stebbins, for the appellants.

It is error in the trial Judge to charge the jury peremptorily to find the defendant guilty upon a certain phase of the testimony, without directing them to pass upon the evidence or the credibility of witnesses.

' Therefore, when, under an indictment for removing a fence surrounding a yard, etc. (Revisal, sec. 3673), there is evidence on the part of the defendant that he was a town marshal, duly acting, after notice, under an order from the proper authorities of a town having the power by its charter to remove it, and there is also evidence that the marshal had personally the right to remove it, irrespective of the order, and that the street had been dedicated, it was error in the court below to ■ direct a verdict against the defendant. 3.

OeiMINal aotioN, tried before Justice, J., and a jury, at September Term, 1906, of the Superior Court of Anson County. This is an indictment for injuring and removing a fence surrounding a yard, garden and cultivated field, under Re-visal, sec. SbYS. When the evidence was closed, the Court instructed the jury to return a verdict of guilty. The defendant contended that the fence obstructed West Street (extended), in the town of Polkton, while the State insisted that thefiand surrounded by the fence had not been dedicated to the public for the purpose of being used as a street, and to these respective contentions the testimony was addressed. There was evidence tending to show, as we think, that the property was originally owned by L. L. Polk, who extended West Street as at first dedicated or laid ont by him and accepted by the town, and then sold lots — at least two— on the extended portion of the street. The defendant testified as follows: “Mr. Briley lives in my house, which is situated in the town of Polkton. The residence is situated on the Sturdivant lot, which is one square acre. There was a street in front of my house when I bought it, twenty-five or thirty years ago. Elms had been set out as shade trees along this road, which were eight or ten years old at the time. The street was opened at that time 75 or 100 yards below my house. The fence constructed by Dr. Smith ran straight across the space opened up for the street, and then ran down the space with my line for some distance and across this space again. The road had been used up to the house. It had been cut out for some distance below, but had never been used. There was a clear space, 40 or 50 feet wide, opened along my eastern line to the Austin line, now the Beaehum line. All of this property was owned by L. L. Polk when I bought the Sturdivant lot and when the Sturdivant lot was bought from me, and also the second lot that I bought from L. L. Polk. Large trees had been cut out and this space opened up for a street, and has now grown up in bushes. I set out shade trees along the space which had been opened for this street eighteen or twenty- years ago. The shade trees are there now — some of them 8 or 10 inches in diameter, or larger. When I bought my property this open space and the street in front of my house were called West Street (extended), or the extension of West Street. I had no ingress to my property below this fence, except along this avenue which had been opened.” There was also evidence, that the defendant, as town marshal, removed the fence as an obstruction to the street, under an order from the proper authorities of the town, which was incorporated by Private Acts of 1874- ’75, cli. 158. Notice of ten days was given to the prosecutor, L. 0. Smith, to remove the fence before the defendant tore it down. A map of the premises was introduced, which shows the extension of West Street and a lot or lots fronting upon it. There was other evidence supporting the defendant’s contention, and also evidence contradicting it and sustaining the theory of the State. In view of the charge of the Oourt, it is not necessary to state it. There was- a verdict of guilty, and judgment was entered thereon. Defendant excepted and appealed.

Under article 312 of the Constitution, a person, part of whose property, consisting of a single unit within the Orleans levee district, is appropriated for levee purposes, has a right of action against the board of commissioners for the recovery of its value, to be ascertained by deducting from the value of the entire property,' as it stood prior to the appropriation, the value of the remainder, as it stands since the appropriation. * 2. Levees <&wkey; 19 — Appropriation of Property — Remedy of Owner — Ascertainment of Value — Constitution. Where, say, one-half of improved property consisting of a definite unit is appropriated under article 312 of the Constitution, it would lie as inconsistent with the right to recover its value, conferred by that article, to hold that it is to be ascertained merely by dividing the aggregate market value per square foot of the entire tract as unimproved land, and attributing the quotient to the half appropriated, as it would be to apply that process to the ascertainment of the value of one half of an oil painting, severed from the other half, and so appropriated, or of á single building, or of a collection of buildings constituting an industrial plant. The principal value of the half of a thing consists in its serving as the complement of, and thereby giving value to, and receiving it from, the other half. 3.

Inasmuch as the grant contained in article 312 of the Constitution is exceptional in character, goes no further than to confer a right of action to recover the value of property appropriated for levee purposes in a particular district, and differs from article 167, in that the latter requires the payment of damages, as well as value (in cases of expropriation), there can be no recovery of damages, as such, under that grant, but the causes thereof may, and must, necessarily, be considered in determining the value of the unappropriated property which is to be deducted from the value of the whole, in order to fix the value of that which is appropriated.

Appeal from the Circuit Court of Henry county; the Hon. John J. Glenn, Judge, presiding. Thomas Smith, of Galva, Henry county, this State,. died testate on February 1,1893. He left surviving him appellant, his widow, and an infant daughter, Cecil, and also appelleeg,—four adult daughters by a former wife. By his last will he disposed of his property as follows: “First—I give and bequeath to my beloved wife, Eva-line Smith, my homestead during her life, and all of my household and kitchen furniture, of every kind and description, to her sole use. “Second—I give and bequeath to' my wife, Evaline Smith, in trust for the support of my daughter Cecil Smith, fifty dollars per year until she shall become of the age of eighteen years. “Third—I give and bequeath to my wife, Evaline Smith, and my daughters, Lucinda Scott, Ida B. Reynolds, Carrie J. Lane, Alta M. Smith (now Dennis) and Cecil Smith, the remainder of my real and personal property, goods and chattels, of what nature or kind soever, to be divided equally between them, share and share alike, after all of my debts and funeral expenses are paid and the foregoing legates are settled.” The adult daughters filed this bill for partition, making the widow and her infant child defendants. At the date of the will, and when he died, the testator owned a part of block 19, in the village of Galva, fronting west on Church street one hundred and seventy-five feet, extending north to First street, running due east and west, and south to Main street, running back eighty-eight feet on First street and about one hundred and fortjr-six feet on Main, the latter street extending in a north-east and south-west direction. The testator had purchased this property as sub-lots, platted irregularly, without streets' or alleys, numbered from 8 to 14, inclusive. At the time he bought it there was a frame house on the south-west corner, fronting on Church street, which had been built without reference to the sub-lots, part of it being on sub-lot 13 and part on sub-lot 14. A well had been dug a short distance north, on sub-lot 12, and in a northeasterly direction, back from the house, were a closet and coal house on another sub-lot. Soon after the purchase he erected a dwelling house on the north-west corner of the property, also fronting on Church street. This house occupied parts of sub-lots 9, 10 and 11. A new coal house and closet were built for this new residence. Testator moved into the new house upon its completion and continued to reside there until his death. The well was used for both the old and the new buildings. Deceased never occupied the old house, but rented it for a hotel, restaurant and other purposes. The principal controversy between the parties here is as to how much of this property passed to the wife under the first clause of the will. Complainants allege in their bill that she is entitled only to the family residence in the north-west corner, with so much of the land as lies north of a certain line running northeasterly through the property, some sixty feet north of the southeastern line, thus setting off a lot of about that width, with the closet, coal house and the well used with her dwelling. The widow claims the whole property. On the hearing the circuit court found with the complainants, and ordered that the widow is entitled to the dwelling house and the above described portion of the ground, valued at §2500, for life, and that the minor child, Cecil, is entitled to a statutory homestead therein until she arrives at the age of twenty-one years, and ordered partition of the remainder of the real estate of which the testator died seized, including that part of said block 19 lying south of said line set off with the old house, but expressly decreeing that partition of the said homestead be not made. From that decree this appeal is prosecuted. John Root, and N. F. Anderson, for appellant. - E. A. Corbin, and Thompson, Shumway & Wasson, for appellees.\",\n",

On the West Main Street end of the lot he erected a building, two stories high in front and one story in height in the rear, which he occupied with his jewelry business for many years, and was so occupying it at the time of his death. On the South Street end of the lot he erected a three-story brick building, which thereafter was occupied by a tenant, who used the first floor and basement for the storage and sale of green vegetables and provisions, and sublet the second and third floors for residence flats, that property being known as Hagan’s Market, No. 9 South Street. The rear ends of the buildings came within nine or ten feet of each other, leaving an area-way between them, which was used in connection with the jewelry store.

In his will testator provided as follows: “I give, devise and bequeath to my son, Isaac Hunt, all of the real estate which I own at No. 7 West Main Street,” in Uniontown, and after making disposition of his residence property and personal estate, he continued: “All the rest and residue of my property not hereinbefore specifically disposed of, of every kind and description, real, personal or mixed, wheresoever situate, I direct shall be equally divided among my eleven children, or their legal heirs,” naming them. Isaac Hunt took possession of the South Street property, as well as the jewelry store, claiming to have taken the whole under the will. In an action of ejectment by the other heirs for the property fronting on South Street, alleged by them to be a part of the testator’s residuary estate: Held, That the devise of the testator to Isaac Hunt carried with it only the land, and the building erected thereon, extending from West Main Street back to the rear wall of the three-story brick building fronting on South Street, known as No. 9 South Street, and did not include the latter building or the land on which it stood, but that the South Street property constituted a part of the residuary estate of the testator. 2. The intention of a testator is to be determined from the words written in his will. If his wishes with regard to the disposition of his property, as thus expressed, can be applied to the existing condition of that property, the result must be accepted. The question in expounding a will is not what the testator meant, but what is the meaning of his words. 3. In such a case statements made by the testator in his lifetime as indicative of his intentions regarding the property are incompetent and irrelevant.

APPEAL AND ERROR &wkey;>500(2) — RULING OB’ COURT MUST BE SHOWN BY RECORD. An objection to sustaining special exceptions to certain portions of a petition is not properly preserved, where there does not appear to be any ruling of the court thereon. 2. Appeal and error <&wkey;1040(4) — Sustaining EXCEPTIONS TO PORTIONS OE PETITION HARMLESS IN VIEW OE EVIDENCE ADMITTED. Sustaining of special exceptions to certain portions of a petition, if error, is harmless, where plaintiff was permitted to introduce his evidence fully on the issues .upon which his rights were predicated in the petition. 3. Eminent domain <&wkey;293(l) — Necessary ELEMENTS OE PETITION EOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM STREET IMPROVEMENT. In an action against a city for damages to property resulting from street improvement,'it is permissible to set out in the petition the definite injuries, the property taken and destroy ed, its intrinsic character, and peculiar value and adaptability for specific purposes, though it is neither necessary nor proper to set out in minute detail all the surrounding circumstances, since the jury under the control and direction of the 'court may consider them in determining the diminution of market value caused by the improvement. 4. Appeal and EBRon &wkey;>670(2) — Qualified BILL OF EXCEPTIONS CANNOT BE VARIED BY EX PARTE AFFIDAVIT OF APPELLANT’S COUNSEL. Where the qualified bill of exceptions discloses that a different charge was requested and refused than the one alleged on appeal, appellant’s counsel may not contradict the court’s qualification and thus vary the facts by their ex parte affidavit. 5. Eminent domain &wkey;»300 — Evidence sufficient TO' SUSTAIN FINDING THAT CITY DID NOT TAKE OR APPROPRIATE PLAINTIFFS-’ LAND. In a suit against a city for damages resulting from street improvement and to recover for land alleged appropriated by the city, evidence held to justify the jury’s finding that no part of plaintiffs’ land was taken and appropriated. .6. Pleading &wkey;>115 — Plea of not guilty TO WRONGS, TRESPASSES, AND INJURIES. TO REAL PROPERTY NOT ADMISSION OF POSSESSION OF DEFENDANT’S PREMISES. An assignment that, because the city’s answer pleaded “not guilty of the wrongs, trespasses, and injuries complained of,” it admits possession of plaintiffs’ premises, and the jury should have been instructed to find for defendant the title and possession of the land, must be overruled, where the suit against the city is not for title and possession, nor in .trespass to try title, but merely seeks to recover for land alleged appropriated. 7. Eminent domain &wkey;>297 — Evidence of CHARACTER OF HOUSES OTHER THAN THOSE ON PLAINTIFFS’ PREMISES IN STREET IMPROVEMENT DAMAGE ACTION ADMISSIBLE. In an action against the city for damages to real property resulting from street improvement, permitting the city to show the character of other houses, in - the neighborhood, and not limiting it to evidence as to plaintiffs’ houses, held not error, in view of the wide scope allowed to both parties in the matter of evidence. 8.

Where a cause is submitted on special issues and there are no special issues submitted by the opposite party from his viewpoint, it will be presumed such party is satisfied with those submitted. 9. Eminent domain <&wkey;302 — Special benefits TO BE CONSIDERED IN ASCERTAINING EXTENT OF DAMAGES FROM STREET IMPROVE- ' MENT. In ascertaining damages to property affected by street improvement, the special benefits to the particular property should be considered, while general benefits to the public should be excluded, and that other property on the same street was damaged or benefited in the same way would not exclude such damages or benefits from consideration. 10.Eminent domain i&wkey;307(3) — Evidence <{&wkey;547 — Elements of and methods of ascertaining DAMAGES TO REAL PROPERTY FROM STREET IMPROVEMENT. The usual way to ascertain market value of real estate is by permitting expert witnesses to state their several methods in ascertaining it, the cotnparison of value of> contiguous property by relation, and the particular uses of the property and those to which it may be put controlled by the court’s instructions, and it was proper in a suit for damages resulting from street improvement to instruct the jury to find the reasonable market value of the property prior to the beginning of the improvements and also just after their completion, leaving the jury to an unlimited field of inquiry and the correct standard of values to work a verdict.

[105 Pac. 1066.] Adverse Possession — Resurvey—Acquiescence in Possession — Established Boundary Line — Permanent Monuments — Ignorance or True Line — Payment oe Taxes. 1. Tbe purpose of a resurvey subsequent to taking of title by purchasers and settlers is to ascertain the lines of the original survey and the original boundaries and monuments as established and laid out by the survey'under which the parties originally took title. 2. Where the grantor of U. entered into possession of and procured title to a town lot and erected and maintained a division fence between sueh lot and the adjoining lot, and occupied the ground up to sueh fence and improved the same, and his grantee, 'ir., remained in sole and exclusive possession of such property for a continuous period of forty years, such possession and occupancy constitutes adverse possession, and vests the title to the whole of such inelosure in such occupant. 3. Id. — In sueh case, where the owner of the adjoining lot and his grantors have, during sueh period of time, been cognizant of U.’s possession and the existence of such division fence, and have made no objection thereto, and have continuously acquiesced therein, the owner cannot be heard to question TJ.’S title after a lapse of forty years. 4. Where one enters into the possession of a tract of land and incloses the same, erecting a fence between sueh tract and the land of an adjoining owner, and continues to maintain such fence and occupy and use the land up to the fence for a period for forty years, with the knowledge and acquiescence of the successive owners of the adjoining land, such occupancy will amount to adverse possession, even though the division fence was erected through mistake as to the true boundary line. 5. Where a fence has constituted a monument between the lots of coterminous 'owners and has so existed for forty years, sueh monument establishes the true boundary line between the adjoining premises, and likewise controls the description in the assessment, where such assessment has been made by lot numbers, and the requirement as to the payment of taxes is satisfied by the payment of taxes on the lot with which the disputed traet' is inclosed and to which it belongs. (Syllabus by the court.) APPEAL from the District Court of the Third Judicial District of the State of Idaho, in and for Ada County. Hon. Fremont Wood, Judge. Action in ejectment and to quiet title to a strip of land about five feet in width. Judgment for plaintiff, and defendant appealed. Reversed. A. A. Fraser, for Appellant. The defendant in this case could not be bound by the survey made by the commission, for the reason that none of the parties who made said survey were called to the stand to tes tify as to its 'accuracy, and the defendant did not have an opportunity to cross-examine the parties who made the commission survey. The commission was not acting under authority of any act of the legislature, and their proceedings could not be binding on any individual. (5 Cyc. 945; Orena v. City of Santa Barbara, 91 Cal. 621, 28 Pac. 268; Chapman v. Polack, 70 Cal. 487, 11 Pae. 768; Marts v. Williams, 67 Ill. 306.) • Under the evidence in this case, the defendant has a good title to all the property inclosed by his said fence by adverse possession. Prior to 1881, payment of taxes was not required in this territory in order that title to property might be acquired by adverse possession. (Brose v. Boise City By. & Term. Co., 5 Ida. 694, 51 Pac. 753.) Independent of the question of adverse possession, the defendant is entitled to all the property lying east of the said fence, and the said fence is the true boundary line between the property of the plaintiff and defendant, by reason of long acquiescence in said line as a dividing line. (Truett v. Adams, 66 Cal. 218, 5 Pac. 100; Columbet v. Pacheco, 48 Cal. 397; Cooper v. Vierra, 59 Cal. 283; Johnson v. Brown, 63 Cal. 393; Burris v. Pitch, 76 Cal, 395, 18 Pac. 864; McNamara v.

Pacheco, 48 Cal. 395; Idaho Land Co. v. Parsons, 3 Ida. 450, 31 Pac. 791.) The occupant’s right and ownership did not come by virtue of a plat and survey; it came by reason of his possession and occupancy and the improvements that he had placed upon his lot. (Scully v. Squier, 13 Ida. 417, 90 Pac. 573.)^ Hawley, Puckett & Hawley, and Morrison. & Pence, for Respondent. Adverse possession is purely a question of intent, and it must be under a claim of title. (Altscul v. O’Neill, 35 Or. 202, 58 Pac. 95'.) There is every presumption that occupancy is in subordination to tbe true title, and if title is claimed adversely, the act of the wrongdoer must be strictly construed and the character of the possession clearly shown. The intention to claim adversely is an essential ingredient. (Prebile v. Maine etc. By. Go., 85 Me. 260, 35 Am. St. 366, and note, 27 Atl. 149, 21 L. R. A. 829; Colvin v. Land Assn., 23 Neb. 75, 8 Am. St. 118, 36 N. W. 361; McDonald v. Fox, 20 Nev. 368, 22 Pac. 234.) Occupying land by mistake does not acquire title by adverse possession. (Prebble v. Maine etc. By. Co., supra; Watrous v. Morrison, 33 Fla. 261, 39 Ám. St. 139, 14 So. 805; Wilson v. Hunter, 59 Ark. 626, 43 Am. St. 63, 28 S. W. 419; Allen v. Beed, 51 Cal. 362.) The defendant must show, in order to establish title to the land in dispute, that he has paid all the taxes, state, county or municipal, which have been levied and assessed upon the land claimed by him according to law since the passage of see. 4043, Rev. Codes, in 1881. (Central Pac. By. Co. v. Shackelford, 63 Cal. 261; Southern Pac. By. Co. v. Whitaker, 109 Cal. 268, 41 Pac. 1083; Brose v. Boise City B. B. T. Co., 5 Ida. 694, 51 Pae. 753; Swank v. Sweetwater Irr. Co., 15 Ida. 353, 98 Pac. 297.) Where the location of the premises intended to be conveyed can be ascertained from the terms used in the instrument of conveyance, neither the aets nor declarations of the parties are admissible to vary the terms thereof.

       "  'case_summary': 'W. H. EISENBREY v. PENNA. CO. FOR INS. APPEAL BY DEPENDANT PROM THE COURT OP COMMON PLEAS NO. 3 OP PHILADELPHIA COUNTY. Argued April 2, 1891 Decided April 13, 1891. [To be reported.] (а) A testatrix directed that a dwelling, at a certain valuation, should be deemed a part of the one third of her residuary estate, the income whereof she gave to her sister for life. Her executors were directed to permit the sister to occupy the dwelling until it should be sold, she paying the taxes and making repairs. (б) The sister was permitted to occupy the house; and, during her occupancy, upon a public street in front of it a fence was erected enclosing the front steps and having a door therein, extending When wide open ten inches beyond the limit within which obstructions were permitted by a city ordinance: 1. The executor, being a mere trustee not in the occupancy of the property even by a tenant, and exercising no control over it, was not responsible for the act of erecting the fence, and therefore was not liable in damages for an injury to a passer-by, caused by the sudden opening of the door against him. 2. Moreover, even if the fence itself was a nuisance, the proximate cause of the injury was not the existence of the fence, but the sudden throwing open of the door; and as this was not done by the executor, or by any agent or servant in the latter’s employ, there was no room for the application of the doctrine of respondeat superior: Kies v. Erie City, 135 Pa. 144. Before Paxson, C. J., Sterrett, Williams, McCollum and Mitchell, JJ. No. 186 January Term 1891, Sup. Ct.; court below, No. 172 December Term 1888, C. P. No. 3. On November 19, 1888, William H. Eisenbrey brought trespass against the Pennsylvania Company for Insurance, etc., trustee under the will of Jane Thomas, deceased, to recover for personal injuries alleged to have been received in consequence of negligence of the defendant in permitting a fence, with a gate or door therein, to be erected in front of certain premises on Filbert street in Philadelphia. The defendant’s plea was not guilty. At the trial on October 31, 1890, the following facts were shown on the part of the plaintiff: About seven o’clock in the evening of November 7,1888, the plaintiff, then sixty-nine years of age, was passing along the north side of Filbert street. When in front of house No. 1421, a gate or door in a picket fence, enclosing the front steps, was suddenly thrown open and struck against him, causing him to lose his balance and fall. In his fall he received a fracture of the left thigh. On cross-examination he testified: “ Q. Your claim is that, as you were passing this house, the •gate or door was suddenly thrown open, and struck you in the breast, knocking you down? A. Yes, sir. Q. The accident was caused by the violent throwing open of this gate without warning to you ? A. Yes, sir.” The house at No. 1421 Filbert street was built in 1842, and at the time of its building it receded four feet from the street line. By a city plan, confirmed April 23, 1888, the four feet of recession were added to the width of the street, but no proceedings were ever had by the city to obtain possession of the additional ground thus embraced in the street. About a year before the plaintiff’s accident, a picket fence was erected enclosing the front steps of the house on three sides, except that the lower step projected beyond it. The width of the structure, across the steps, was seven feet and two inches. The fence extended into the street seven feet beyond the house line. The entire width of the pavement, from the house line to the curb, was seventeen feet nine inches. In the front of the fence was a gate or door two feet, four and one half inches wide. An ordinance of the city, enacted September 28, 1864, declared it a nuisance to maintain any cellar-door, porch or steps, extending more than four feet six inches into any footway of any street of the width of fifty feet or upwards, or a proportionate distance on streets of less than fifty feet. On June 6, 1885, that ordinance was amended by adding the following proviso: “ Provided, that this section shall not apply to any street one hundred feet wide or upwards; and provided further, that such extension shall not reduce the width of the footway to less than eighteen feet.” Samuel L. Smedley, the chief engineer of the city, testified that when the gate in question was opened to its full swing it extended ten inches beyond the nuisance limit of four feet six inches, but when shut it was within the limits in which obstructions were permitted. Jane Thomas, who died in 1876, was the owner of this house. By her will, duly admitted to probate, she provided as follows: “It is my will and direction that my house and lot, now No. 1421 Filbert street, in the city of Philadelphia, shall, at the value of $20,000, be deemed and taken as a part of the one third of my residuary trust-estate, whereof my sister Sarah R. Bull has the income for life ; and I authorize and empower my executors, until they shall decide it to be expedient to sell the said house and lot, to permit and suffer her, the said Sarah R. Bull, to occupy and use the same as a home for her, she paying the taxes thereon and keeping the same in repair at her own expense while she shall so occupy the same.” The will appointed the defendant company to be the executor thereof. Jarvis Mason, trust officer of the defendant company, being called by the plaintiff, testified as follows: “Q. You know Mrs. Sarah Bull? A. Yes, sir. Q. Has she a life-estate in the property 1421 Filbert street ? A. She has. Q. Did your company have anything to do with putting up this paling or erection about the premises there ? A. No, sir; nothing. Q. Did you ever see it there ? A. I have. Q. Do you know how long it had been there? A. No, sir.” Cross-examination: “Q. You had no right to interfere in. any way, shape, or form with the property, had you ? A. No, sir ; not any. Q. And you had nothing to do with the erection of that fence? A. No, sir; nothing whatever. Q. You accidentally saw it in passing? A. Yes, sir; not as an officer of the company, but merely walking around there occasionally.” Another witness for the plaintiff testified: “ Q. Do you know who occupied the house; was it Mrs. Bull? A. I think it was the lady over in the court-room. Q. She was occupying it at the time the thing was put there, wasn’t she, and she has been there for many years? A. Yes, sir; I think so.” The same witness stated that the fence was taken away soon after the accident to the plaintiff. At the close of the testimony for the plaintiff, a motion for a nonsuit having been overruled and the defendant offering no testimony, the court, Finlbtter, P. J., charged the jury in part as follows: The questions of law which govern the right of the plaintiff in this case to recover I have decided in his favor. In other words, [I have decided that, as matter of law, the defendant in this action is responsible for the injuries which the plaintiff suffered on that occasion.] a In this I may or may not be right, but for the purposes of this case you must take that to be the law. Hereafter, when more time can be given to the consideration of the matter, and when I shall have the assistance of my two brother judges, the questions of law can be considered more at length and with more care. Therefore, the only question for you to determine is, what damages will be proper compensation to the plaintiff for the injuries which he has sustained. . . . Counsel for defendant has requested me to charge you as follows: 1.The learned court is asked to direct a verdict for defendants. Answer: I refuse to affirm that point.1 —The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for $5,000. A rule for a new trial having been discharged and judgment entered, the defendant took this appeal, assigning for error: 1. The refusal of defendant’s point.1 2. The part of the charge embraced [ ] 3 Mr. John Cr. Johnson, for the appellant: 1. There was no negligence on the part of the defendant in the erection complained of; it is not responsible for an illegal act not authorized by it nor within its control. Under the will of Jane Thomas, directing the trustee to permit Sarah Bull to occupy the premises as a home, the latter had an equitable estate for life: Arkwright v. Colt, 2 Y. & C. 4; Loring v. Carnes, 148 Mass. 223. The liability of a trustee bound to permit a cestui que trust to occupy premises, is no greater than that of a landlord who voluntarily transfers the possession to a tenant. 2. It is elementary law that a landlord is not responsible for anything done on the demised premises by the tenant, during the term of his lease: Shear. & Redf. on Neg., § 708; Wharton on Neg., § 817; Wood on L. & T., 917; Woodfall on L. & T., *735; Bears v. Ambler, 9 Pa. 193; Grier v. Sampson, 27 Pa. 183; Little Schuylkill Co. v. Richards, 57 Pa. 142; Wunder v. McLean, 134 Pa. 334; Lowell v. Spaulding, 4 Cush. 277; Pretty v. Bickmore, L. R. 8 C.

The person who actually threw open the door negligently is alone responsible, unless shown to be the servant or employee of a principal responsible for the servant’s act. The fence and door did not constitute a nuisance, and no harm could come to any person by reason of the proper opening of the door. The whole negligence consisted in the improper opening of it. It was not shown who threw it open, and it was incumbent on the plaintiff to show that the person doing this was an employee oí the defendant: Kies*v. Erie City, 135 Pa. 150. Mr. George B. Oarr, for the appellee: 1. Under the will of Jane Thomas, the rights of Sarah R. Bull, with reference to the property in question, were dependent upon conditions and contingencies. She could have no interest in it except while actually occupying the house, and her interest was to continue only so long as she complied with the direction to pay the fixed charges. Even if she did comply therewith, the trustee could have determined her occupancy at any time. She was no more than a tenant at will: Hurd v. Cushing, 7 Pick. 169; Burns v. Bryant, 31 N. Y. 453; Johnson v. Johnson, 13 R. I. 467; Herill v. Sizeland, 81 111. 457. 2. The trustee, having the option of permitting or determining Mrs. Bull’s occupancy, and being under the duty of seeing that she complied with the conditions under which she held, was vested with such control over the property as to be responsible for a nuisance which it permitted to be erected: Wood’s Law of Nuisances, 78, 141; Wood’s L. & T., 618; Brown v. Railroad Co., 12 N. Y. 486; Irvine v. Wood, 51 N. Y. 224 (10 Am. Rep. 603); McCarthy v. Syracuse, 46 N. Y. 194; White v. Board of Health, L. R. 102 [? ?] Q. B. 219. Where the very existence of a thing constitutes a nuisance, a landlord is responsible; as in the case of a permanent erection impeding access to a public market: Thompson v. Gibson, 7 M. & W. 456; or a dangerous excavation near a highway: Rolle’s Abr., Nuisance (K. 2); Irvine v. Wood, 51 N. Y. 224. 3. This erection was a nuisance. It was in violation of the ordinance of 1885, providing that the width of sidewalks should not be reduced by obstructions to less than 18 feet. Any encroachment upon a highway is a nuisance, whether it is actually dangerous to travel or not: Angelí on Highways, § 223; Bacon v. Boston, 3 Cush. 174. It is not a question whether harm could come to any person by “ the proper opening of the door.” If the doctrine of Kies v. Erie City, 135 Pa. 150, be the law of Pennsylvania, a tornado may as well sweep away all the ordinances bn the subject of nuisances. 4. The trust officer of the defendant, who “ walked around there occasionally,” evidently did so in discharge of the duties incumbent on the defendant with respect to the supervision of the property. His knowledge of the existence of the nuisance, acquired by inspection on those occasions, was the knowledge of the defendant. With that knowledge, the defendant was negligent in permitting it to remain, neither saying nor doing anything about it. And the defendant owed a duty, both to the estate of the testatrix and to the public, to see that no nuisance was maintained upon the premises. * The witness measured the four feet six inches from the original line of the street, in view of the fact that the four feet added to its width in April, 1888, had never been legally condemned by the city.',\n",

       "  'case_summary': \"CLARENCE W. TURNER v. THE UNITED STATES AND THE CREEK NATION OF INDIANS. [No. 30241. Decided April 10, 1916.] On the Proofs. Jurisdiction; Parties.—Where an act of Congress authorizes suit against an Indian nation and fails to prescribe the method of service of process it is doubtful whether the Court of Claims can direct the necessary or proper service to bring the defendants before the court. United States as Party; Parties.—The United States can not be made parties defendant to an action authorized to be brought against an Indian nation if the jurisdictional act is silent upon that subject. Indians; Contract; Statutes.—Where the laws of the Creek Nation authorized citizens of the nation to make contracts securing them certain special rights in communal pastures the right could not be secured by or in conjunction with persons who were not citizens of the nation. Indians; Torts; Sovereignty.—The Creek Nation has elements of an independent sovereignty, and in the absence of a law recognizing its liability for torts of citizens of the nation against noncitizens the rule that a sovereign is not liable to suit for the action of a mob is applicable in an action against that nation for the consequences of a destruction of property of the noncitizen. Contract; Tort; Nuisance.—A contract secured in violation of law is not to be enforced, and a tort committed can not be treated as a violation of a contract entered into in contravention of a statute of an Indian nation. Parties proceeding under the supposed right of such a contract may become liable for creating a public nuisance, and an individual or individuals who are specially damaged thereby may abate a public nuisance, using no more force and doing no more damage than is necessary to abate the nuisance. The Reporter's statement of the case: The following are the facts of the case as found by the court: I. The claimant, Clarence W. Turner (whose place of residence is Muskogee, Okla.), is the surviving partner of the firm of Blackstone & Turner, which was composed of Pleasant N. Blackstone and Clarence W. Turner. Said firm engaged in the business of raising and selling cattle in the year 1890 and before and after that year. The said Blackstone died on or about the-day of April, 1903. II. A treaty between the United States and the Creek Nation of Indians was concluded June 14, 1866, and proclaimed by the President August 11, 1866, 14 Stats., 785, whereby certain rights were secured to the respective parties to the treaty. Among others, the Creeks ceded and conveyed to the United States the west half of their entire domain, estimated to contain over 3,000,000 acres, and the United States were to pay 30 cents per acre therefor. By Article X of said treaty it was provided as follows: “ The Creeks agree to such legislation as Congress and the President of the United States may deem necessary for the better administration of justice and the protection of the rights of person and property within the Indian Territory: Provided, however, [That] said legislation shall not in any manner interfere with or annul their present tribal organization, rights, laws, privileges, and customs. The Creeks also agree that a general council, consisting of delegates elected by each nation or tribe lawfully resident within the Indian Territory, may be annually convened in said Territory, which council shall be organized in such manner and possess such powers as are hereinafter described * * III. The said Creek Nation of Indians kept up their tribal organization and customs and had a system of laws for many years and until the year 1906, at which date the tribal government was terminated by the general provisions of the act of March 1, 1901, 81 Stats., 861, 872, section 46 of which reads as follows: “ 46. The tribal government of the Creek Nation shall not continue longer than March fourth, nineteen hundred and six, subject to such further legislation as Congress may deem proper.” The United States held in trust for the Creek Nation of Indians on November 18, 1915, the sum of $1,325,167.16. In addition thereto approximately $1,110,000 of the tribal funds of said nation is on deposit in the Oklahoma State and national banks, under the provisions of the act of March 3, 1911, 36 Stat., 1058, 1070, or a total of $2,435,167.16. Under their constitution it was provided that the lawmaking power of the nation was lodged in a council, consisting of two houses—the house of kings and the house of warriors; that there should be a principal chief elected for a term of four years by a majority of the votes of the male citizens of the Muskogee Nation who had attained the age of 18 years; that the “supreme law-defining power” should be lodged in a high court composed of five citizens over the age of 25 years, chosen by the national council; that the nation should be divided into six districts; and that each district should be furnished with a judge, a prosecuting attorney, and a company of light-horsemen—one captain and four privates— and the light-horsemen were to be invested with police powers and were under the direction of the judge of the district. The national treasurer was selected by the national council, and his duty was to receive and receipt for all national funds and to disburse the same, as should be provided for by law. He was required to report the condition of the national finances to the national council and was required to give a bond in the sum of $5,000. Their laws also provided with reference to intermarried noncitizens as follows: “Article III. Intermarried Noncitizens. “ Section 1. All noncitizens, not previously adopted, and being married to citizens of this nation, or having children entitled to citizenship, shall have a right to live in this nation and enjoy all the privileges enjoyed by other citizens, except participation in the annuities and final participation in the lands, and in case of removal from the limits of our nation shall not have the right to sell their improvements, provided that such person shall satisfy the principal chief as to their good character and honest intentions, and provided that the principal chief shall grant to such person permit to reside in the nation during good behavior.” Other provisions of their laws and acts amendatory of the statute of 1889 hereafter mentioned may be found in an official publication entitled “ Constitution and Laws of the Muskogee Nation, 1893.” IY. In the year 1889 the said lawmaking power of said Greek Nation of Indians enacted the following: “Whereas certain citizens of the Muskogee Nations have petitioned the national council representing that a few citizens engaged in the cattle interests have entered large areas of the public domain for their exclusive use in the grazing of cattle, which operate to the detriment of many who live in the vicinity of such inclosures; and “ Whereas it is complained that a dangerous monopoly of the natural advantages of the country is thereby threatened to the detriment of the general welfare of the nation; and “ Whereas it appears to be desirable that some protection should be afforded the live-stock interest of our citizens against the influx of large herds of cattle into our country from neighboring nations; and “ Whereas it is the desire of the nations, in view of these surrounding conditions, to provide as near as may be such remedial legislation as will afford the protection and benefits desired without unreasonable detriment to the interest of either of the classes of citizens in interest: Therefore “Be it enacted hy the national council of the Mushogee Nation, That any citizen, head of a family, engaged in the keeping or grazing of live stock in this nation, shall for that purpose be entitled to inclose for his exclusive use, free of any manner of tax, 1 mile square of the lands of the public domain, but such inclosures shall not intrude on the rights of any other citizen without his or her consent. “ Be it further enacted, That all persons who entered pastures greater in extent than 1 mile square prior to the passage of this act are hereby permitted to occupy and use the same for the purpose of holding and grazing stock thereon until the first day of May, 1890, at which date they are hereby required to raze and take down the fences forming the inclosures. “Beit further enacted, That if the owner or owners of any pasture subject to removal under the provisions of this act shall fail to take down and remove or make due and diligent efforts to effect such removal within 10 days after the said first day of May, the judge of the district wherein such pasture is located shall cause the light-horse company to take down the fences inclosing the same. If by reason of resistance offered by the owners of such inclosures they shall be unable to take such fences down, then it is hereby made the duty of the principal chief to call into service a sufficient number of the citizens of the district who, under the direction of the light-horse captain, shall proceed to take the fences down as hereinbefore provided. “Be it further enacted, That where extensive pastures greater in extent than 1 square mile can be located on the borders of the nation to the benefit of any neighborhood by affording protection against the influx of stock from aidjoining nations, the same may be located under the following conditions, to wit: The judge of the district shall be notified by any number of citizens of the district of their desire for the establishment of such protective pasture or pastures; he shall then give due notice to the people of the neighborhood of the time and place of a meeting of voters, who, when so convened, shall determine by vote, or as they shall deem proper, the question whether or not such pastures are needed. If it shall appear by a majority of persons of voting age of the neighborhood thus to be protected favor the establishment of such pastures, it shall then be the duty of the judge to let or grant only the privilege of holding and grazing stock on such lands to such citizen or citizens as may by contract bind themselves to build a substantial fence of four or more strands of wire and to pay for said grazing privileges an amount per acre per year that shall not be less than 5 cents. The location of such tract or tracts of land as shall be occupied under the provisions of this act shall be described in the body of the contract, which contract shall include all provisions necessary to insure and protect the interests of the nation and the citizens thereof and shall be in force for the period of three years, with the privilege of renewal. “ Be it further enacted, That pastures greater in area than 1 mile square which have been inclosed prior to the enactment of this law which operate already as a protection of any neighborhood or portion of country against the drifting in of stock from surrounding countries may remain unmolested when the same shall be requested as provided m the section next preceding. In such cases, however, the judge is hereby directed to contract with the persons owning the pastures, which contract shall be subject to all the conditions imposed in the preceding section of this act. It is further required that all pastures remaining intact or which shall be built under the provisions of this act shall be provided on all sides with gates 10 feet wide at the distance of 1 mile or about 1 mile apart; and if stock of any kind escape from such inclosures and cause loss or damage to any citizen, it shall be the duty of the judge of the district, when complaint is made, to proceed, with two disinterested persons, and assess the damages, which shall be paid by the owners or managers of the pastures. “ Be it further enacted, That the judge contracting with the owners of the pastures shall make collection of the tax of 5 cents per acre per year provided under this act, commencing his assessment from the date of contract, which he shall pay into the National Treasury on the first day.of each quarter, beginning, respectively, with the months of January, April, July, and October of each year. He shall also render to the national council a full report of all moneys collected, together with receipts from the National Treasurer. And if any owner of pasture shall fail to make any quarterly payment or fail to comply with any of the obligations embraced in the contract with the judge, then he shall forfeit all the franchise granted by the terms of his contract, and the district judge shall so declare and enforce such forfeiture. “ Be vt further enacted, That this act shall take effect from and after its passage, and the principal chief is hereby authorized to furnish printed copies thereof to each district judge, who shall distribute them to all interested parties. “Approved October 26, 1889. “ L. C. Perryman, “ Principal Chief, M. NP Several instances are shown by the evidence where under said act “ noncitizens ” made arrangements with “ citizens ” that the .latter should apply for the right to have a pasture and upon its being granted the noncitizens would use it for pasturage and pay the citizens who had secured it. V. Said Clarence W. Turner had resided among said Creek Nation of Indians from the early seventies. In 1883 he married the daughter of an Indian of Cherokee blood named Butler, who had been adopted prior to the Civil War into the Creek Nation of Indians, and she was raised as a Creek and was given an allotment of land among the Creeks. The said Pleasant N. Blackstone was of Cherokee blood and was not a citizen of the Creek Nation of Indians. VI. After the said enactment authorizing pastures to be established the said firm of Blackstone. & Turner, or one of them acting for both, originated and caused to be put into effect a plan whereby application should be made by certain of the Creek Indians for the establishment of a pasture in what was known as the Deep Fork district and the securing of a right for the same, and to that end an organization was formed consisting of 100 of said Indians and the said Pleasant N. Blackstone and Clarence W. Turner. The said organization took the name of Pussy, Tiger &.Co., Pussy being a prominent Indian and Moty Tiger another. The remaining 98 Indians in said organization were sought out as Indians who would engage to further the proposed plan, and they lived within the confines of the pasture in said Deep Fork district. Pussy lived about 4 miles from the pasture and Tiger lived about 18 miles therefrom. It was understood and agreed between the parties composing the said association of Pussy, Tiger & Co. that in the event of the pasture being established each of the said 100 Indians would be paid by the said Blackstone & Turner $100 per year, payable quarterly; that the said Blackstone & Turner would pay the tax of 5 cents per acre per year to the Creek Nation of Indians; and that the said firm of Blackstone & Turner should have and retain any balances of any fund that might accrue from any transfer of a right to others to use the pasture. The said 98 Indians were full bloods and illiterate and, generally speaking, were poor. A number of them had a few cattle which grazed in said neighborhood. The said Indians were not financially able to build any fence and did not contemplate doing so themselves, but relied upon the said Clarence W. Turner to provide for the financing of the proposition. VII. In furtherance of said plan for a pasture, application was made by Pussy, Tiger & Co. to Jacob Knight, judge of the Deep Fork district, in which the proposed pasture was located, and an election was held in conformity with the said enactment set out in Finding IV. More than 100 citizens of the neighborhood voted at the election, and the result of the election was a defeat of the application for the pasture. When the said result was announced, and upon the same day, Pussy notified the judge that another election was desired, and Pussy, Tiger & Co. filed an application for a second election, and the judge announced to the people that another election would be held on October 11. Some of the voters had left the place when the judge’s announcement was made. The people concerned knew where the proposed pasture would be situated, but they were not informed as to what its acreage would be. The said application for a second election was filed on September 30,1890, and was in words and figures as follows: “ Courthouse, Deep Fork Dist., M. N., “ Sept. 30, 1890. “ To the Hon. Jacob Knight, “ Judge, Deep Fork Dist. “ Sir: We, the citizens of the Muskogee Nation, do hereby ask you to give us an election to build a pasture in the said district according to the laws of this nation enacted October 6th, 1889. “Boundary line thus to commence: Northwest corner of this district, running south on the Sac and Fox line to the North Fork Kiver, thence down said river twenty-five miles more or less, and thence north to the Deep Fork Kiver, thence west up said river of Deep Fork to the starting point; to be not less than one hundred thousand acres. “Pussy, Tiger & Co.” The judge of the Deep Fork district entered thereon the following order: “ Courthouse, Deep Fork Dist., “ Sept. 30, 1890. “ In compliance to the above application, I have this day set October 11, 1890, for an election of pasture, to be held at the courthouse of Deep Fork district, M. N. “ Jacob Knight, “ Judge, Deep Fork Dist. “ [seal.] “ D. C. Watson, Clerk ” On October 11,1890, the second election was held, and the result thereof declared as follows: “ Courthouse, Deep Fork Dist., M. N., “ October 11,1890. “ Election held this day above dated for a pasture, according to the application of Pussy, Tiger & Co., as follows, to wit: “ Fifty-nine for and thirty against, and the pasture elected by twenty-nine majority. “ Thereby the pasture entitled. “ I hereby certify that the above election is just and correct and held according to the laws of the Muskogee Nation. “ Given under my hand and signature this day above dated. “ Jacob Knight, “ Judge, Deep Fork Dist., M. N. “ [seal.] “ D. C. Watson, Clerk:’’ There were above 300 voters in the said Deep Fork district. The evidence does not show the number of voters living in the neighborhood of said pasture. At the said second election a majority of the Indians in the said association of Pussy, Tiger & Co. voted for the pasture. After the result of the second election was announced a contract was entered into, a copy of which forms Exhibit A to the petition and is in words and figures as follows: “ Contract and agreement made and entered into this-day of October, 1890, by and between Jacob Knight, judge of the Deep Fork district, Creek Nation, he being duly authorized in the premises under the act of the national council of October 6, 1889, and Pussy, Tiger and Company, citizens of the Creek Nation. “ This contract witnesseth— “That Jacob Knight, judge of the Deep Fork district, Creek Nation, hereby contracts with and licenses Pussy, Tiger & Co., they having complied with all the provisions and requirements of the pasture act of October 6, 1889, precedent to entering into this contract, to inclose a certain pasture in the Deep Fork district, Creek Nation, for— “ Beginning at a stone on the boundary line between the Sac and Fox and Creek Nations, two miles more or less southeast of the Sac and Fox Agency, running thence south sixteen miles; thence easterly twenty-five miles; thence northerly sixteen miles; thence westerly twenty-five miles to place of beginning, not less than one hundred thousand acres. “That Pussy, Tiger & Co., on their part, agree to build good and substantial fence of four strands of barbed wire, inclosing the tract of country hereinabove described, and bind themselves to comply with all the provisions of the act of October 6th, 1889, and which act is made a part of this contract. “ (Signed) Jacob Knight, “Judge, Deep Fork Dist., M. N. “D. C. Watson, Clerk. “ Motet Tiger, Pres. “ John Pussy, V. Pres. “ J. S. Kobison, Sec'ty. [seal.] ” VIII. At some time prior to the winter of 1890 the said firm of Blackstone & Turner or the said claimant, acting for the firm, made an agreement with a firm known as Daniel Waggoner & Son, who were largely engaged in cattle raising and grazed large numbers of cattle, whereby the said Daniel Waggoner & Son agreed, in consideration of the assignment to them of the right to use and graze their cattle upon the said pasture to pay Blackstone & Turner the sum of $27,500 a year during the term of said contract. At that time the building of the fence had not been commenced, and Daniel Waggoner & Son agreed with Blackstone & Turner that the former would advance $10,000, and they did advance that sum, to be used in the purchase of material with which to build the fence around said pasture. The said sum so advanced was to be a credit on the annual payment of $27,500 which Daniel Waggoner & Son were to pay to Blackstone & Turner, as aforesaid. After making the said agreement with said Daniel Wag-goner & Son the said Turner employed a man named Moore to erect said fence, agreeing to pay him $36 per mile of fence and $2 for each gate erected. Turner furnished the wire and staples, and the posts were cut from the Indian lands. Moore employed men and commenced building the fence early in March, 1891. Before and after the work of building the fence commenced complaints were made by Creek Indians living in the district, and objections to the fence or pasture were made. From the time the fence was commenced and continuing throughout its construction rumors reached the parties engaged in erecting the fence of threats by Indians to destroy the same. IX. On or about the first Monday in June, 1891, a number of Creek Indians, having banded themselves together, proceeded to destroy and did destroy so much of the fence as had been erected and to cut the wire used in the fence. When the fence was destroyed about 60 miles of it had been finished, posts had been erected around the balance, and the wire had been strung on all except about 20 miles of the distance. The cattle of said Daniel Waggoner & Son had at that time been turned in upon the pasture and were grazing thereon. The fence was never rebuilt, and no efforts to rebuild it were made, owing to threats of its destruction if rebuilt. X. As the construction of the fence proceeded, threats of its destruction were made and reached the builders. These threats grew in volume as the work progressed. About a month prior to the cutting of the fence a number of citizens inside the area of the fence requested Treasurer Moore to call upon the principal chief, Perryman, to take steps to prevent the construction of the fence and to inform said principal chief of their purpose to destroy the fence if he did not prevent its erection. Treasurer Moore so informed the principal chief, who gave no positive assurance as to what his course would be. About the same time Judge Knight wrote to the principal chief inquiring whether the fence was a legal fence or not. Treasurer Moore made one or more visits to the principal chief subsequent to the one above mentioned and notified him that the people in the district intended to destroy the fence. About the last of April or early in May the claimant, Turner, who then resided at Muskogee, received information through his agent of threats that the fence would be destroyed, and he sent for Waggoner & Son. Thereupon the claimant, Turner, and one of the Waggoners, on the 4th day of May, 1891, caused to be filed in the United States court for the first judicial division of the Indian Territory a bill in the name of Daniel Waggoner & Son against L. C. Perryman and Jacob Knight as defendants, praying, among other things, for an injunction against the tearing down or the removal of said fence around said pasture. A copy of said bill for an injunction and the several orders thereon are attached to the petition herein as Exhibit A-3. During the latter part of May threats against the fence increased. Notices were placed at different parts of the boundary forbidding its erection. Some days before it was destroyed Indians assembled in the nighttime in the vicinity of the place where the work was being done and by discharging guns and making noises attempted to scare away the workmen. Threats of personal violence to the workmen, some of whom were Indians, were made. Indians representing themselves to be light horsemen told Moore, the fence builder, that the fence would be destroyed. A few days before it was cut, Isparecher, a full-blood Indian, and a leader of the full bloods in the neighborhood of the fence, appeared in person and informed the builder, Moore, through an interpreter, that the Indians would destroy the fence unless he suspended work, which Moore refused to do. On the first Monday in June the Indians divided themselves into three groups, and acting in concert attacked in the daytime the fence on three sides with axes, cutting the posts and the wire, and destroyed the entire fence. Spools of wire and staples had been distributed along the line of the fence preparatory to stringing the wire, and these spools of wire were cut and the staples scattered. Two of the groups engaged in destroying the fence were each composed of about 25 Indians, who came from settlements outside the neighborhood of the fence. These were joined by Indians inside the bounds and by Indians outside of the fence, and more than a hundred engaged in the said destruction. Isparecher, who afterwards became principal chief of the nation, was one of the Indian leaders in the movement to destroy the fence and in its actual destruction. He had a ranch near the boundaries of the fence and grazed several hundred cattle on the lands in question. He lived about 8 miles from said neighborhood. Treasurer Moore also grazed a number of cattle on said lands and lived about 6 miles from the pasture. He was another of the leaders in the said destruction. Fixico, an Indian preacher, who lived in the neighborhood of the fence, was another of the leaders, and except these three, who were the leaders, the evidence does not show the names of the Indians engaged in the work of destruction. Prior to the destruction of the fence rumors were circulated among the Indians in said district that money had been used in said elections. Some objections to the fence were on account of the size of the pasture, and other objections were because it was claimed that the common right of pasturage was interfered with. The Indians living within the confines of the fence were full bloods, generally illiterate and poor, and without knowledge of the English language. Some of them had from 15 to 20 head of cattle that ranged on said lands. The said threats to destroy the fence became and were matter of general notoriety in the Deep Fork district. The parties engaged in building the fence did not apply to the Indian authorities for protection against said threats, and none of said authorities took steps to prevent the destruction of the fence. XI. A day or two before the 1st of April, 1891, the said Moore sent to Moty Tiger $1,250 in amount of warrants or scrip, known as auditor’s certificates, and which were a legal tender for taxes in the Creek Nation, to be delivered by said Moty Tiger to the district judge as a quarterly payment on the tax due under the contract of 5 cents per acre. Moty Tiger sent these certificates to the judge, who subsequently reported to Tiger that he had taken them to the national treasurer and that the treasurer would not receive them, and the judge delivered them back to Moty Tiger, from whom he had gotten them. That was the only payment tendered or made on account of the tax for said pasture. A short time thereafter Turner sent to Moty Tiger $2,500 in money to be distributed to the Indian membership of Pussy, Tiger & Co. When the fence was destroyed Blackstone & Turner had expended in and about its building the sum of $12,046.82. They recovered materials valued at $1,968.46, which left a net loss on the fence of $10,078.76. The material for constructing said fence had been purchased from the Turner Hardware Co., which was owned and controlled by the said Clarence W. Turner, and later the firm of Blackstone & Turner became insolvent, and said Turner repaid to Daniel Wagoner & Son the $10,000 advanced by them as aforesaid and which had been used in purchasing the said material from the Turner Hardware Co. Several times thereafter— to wit, in November, 1892, October, 1893, November, 1893, and November, 1894, the said claimant presented his claim to the council of the Creek Nations of Indians for $10,078.16, and payment was refused. At one time the council voted in favor of paying said claim and the resolution was vetoed by Principal Chief Perryman. The council subsequently sustained the veto. A copy from the minute book of the supreme court of the Creek Nation of Indians of an order by that court was introduced in evidence, as follows: “Supreme court, November 2, 1896. Court convened; opened with prayer by John Reed. Court continued consideration of the question submitted by the Pussy, Tiger Co.; after long and earnest arguments court decided the pasture was legal, having been built in accordance with the law then in existence. Then took up the question submitted by H. C. Reed as to claims on the public domain. Court, in the absence of law governing the public domain, declined to render an opinion and adjourned.” “ Nov. 3, court convened, etc.” And at the bottom of the page is the following: “ Supreme Court, Okmulgee, M. N., Nov. 2, 1896. Hon. Roley McIntosh 2d and acting prin. chief, M. N., Sir: We have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of Oct. 31, submitting the question prepared by the Pussy Tiger Co., to wit: ‘Whether the building of the pasture in question was legal under the law then in existence providing for the building of large pastures.’ “ In reply we have to say that after careful investigation and earnest consideration the court has decided that the building of the pasture was legal. “ David Anderson, “Chief Justice. “ Sue M. Eogers, Clh.” XII. In “An act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to issue patents in fee to purchasers of Indian lands under any law now existing or hereafter enacted, and for other purposes,” approved May 29,1908 (35 Stats., 444), it is provided, by section 26 thereof, as follows: _ “ That the Court of Claims is hereby authorized to consider and adjudicate and render judgment as law and equity may require in the matter of the claim of Clarence W. Turner, of Muskogee, Oklahoma, against the Creek Nation for the destruction of personal property, and the value of the loss of the pasture of the said Turner, or his assigns, by the action of any of the responsible Creek authorities, or with their cognizance and acquiescence, either party to said cause in the Court of Claims to have the right of appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States.” XIII. On the 13th day of September, 1910, the claimant filed his said petition in this court, and upon the filing thereof the clerk of the court transmitted a copy of it by mail addressed to the chief of the Creek Nation of Indians, and also sent a copy to the Attorney General of the United States. The rules of the Court of Claims at that time provided that— “ Suits shall be commenced by petition, verified in the manner provided by law, and filed in the office of the clerk, with one extra copy in print or typewriting. The clerk will note thereon the day of filing, and will cause a copy to be forwarded to the Attorney General.” At the time said copy was transmitted M. L. Mott, Esq., held the office of national attorney for the Creek Nation, and he associated with him W. L. Sturdevant, Esq., of St. Louis, Mo. On the 3d day of October, 1908, the said Sturdevant forwarded a paper addressed to the clerk of this court purporting to be a demurrer to the petition of the claimant, and the same was not filed but was returned by the clerk with the statement that Mr. Sturdevant not being an attorney of this court the paper signed by him could not be received and filed. Said letter reads as follows: “I return herewith the demurrer and copy of same inclosed in your letter of October 3, 1908, upon the suggestion of the Assistant Attorney General representing the Government in said cause. He desires me to say that as the United States is joined with the Creek Nation of Indians as defendant the proper procedure is for the attorney or attorneys representing the tribe of Indians, defendant, to confer with the Attorney General before taking action. “ I may add further that neither yourself nor Mr. Mott have been admitted to our bar, and Mr. Mott at least, the authorized attorney for the defendant Indians, should apply for admission in the usual way as prescribed by No. 8 of our rules, a copy of which I inclose you under another cover.” The claimant took the depositions of a number of witnesses, commencing in July, 1909. At the taking of said depositions the said Mott and Sturdevant appeared and cross-examined the witnesses; and later, in September, 1909, the said Mott and Sturdevant examined certain witnesses on behalf of the defendant Indians, and the testimony of all of said witnesses is included in the record. On the 17th day of August, 1914, a brief of E. C. Allen, national attorney for the Creek Nation of Indians, was filed in the clerk’s office of this court, in which, among other things, it was contended that the said jurisdictional act did not grant authority for the bringing of the suit; did not grant authority to make the United States a party or to recover against the United States and the Muskogee (Creek) Nation jointly or severally; and that the court had no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the act. On the 6th day of January, 1915, the case was called in court and the claimant appeared by counsel, and E. C. Allen, national attorney for the Creek Nation of Indians, appeared for the purposes of his said motion, but the United States did not appear by counsel; and it is here stated at the request of claimant’s attorney that at the time of the said appearance in court of E. C. Allen, national attorney for the Creek Nation of Indians, he was accompanied by the principal chief of the Creek Nation in person. The ques tions were discussed by counsel, and the claimant’s attorney amended his petition by striking out the name of the United States as a party defendant, and the case was submitted to the court. On the next day the claimant’s attorney appeared in court and requested that the submission of the day before be set aside, which was done, and that he be allowed to amend his petition, which was allowed. Thereafter, on the 25th day of October, 1915, the said attorney for the Creek Nation filed another brief, in which he appeared specially for the purpose of moving to dismiss the case on the ground that the court was without jurisdiction. On the same date the United States, by its Attorney General, filed a motion to dismiss the case against the United States for want of jurisdiction. The case was then submitted to the court upon the said motion of the national attorney for the Creek Nation, and without waiving said motions the case was also submitted upon the merits. The United States refused to appear further than to make their motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction. Messrs. C. H. Merillat and Marion Butler for the plaintiff. Messrs. J. M. Vale and G. J. Happier were on the briefs. It is submitted that judgment under the established facts in the record must be rendered in favor of claimant for the labor and materials lost, and also the loss of use of the pasture. The power of Congress in the premises is supreme and plenary. In Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, 187 U. S., 553-66, the Supreme Court said: “ Plenary authority over the tribal relations of the Indians has been exercised by Congress from the beginning, and the power has always been deemed a political one, not subject to be controlled by the judicial department of the Government. * * * The power exists to abrogate the provisions of an Indian treaty.” See also Cherokee Nation v. Hitchcock, 187 U. S., 294; Stephens v. Cherokee Nation, 174 Ib., 445. It was for Congress, therefore, to say whether the Indian tribe in this case should or should not be sued and should be held liable or not and what conditions should create a tribal liability. Without Congressional authority there is no power of suit against an Indian tribe. Congress, on the showing made to it as to the loss claimant had suffered, determined that this liability should be found in the event that it was established that the loss suffered was the consequence either of the “ action of any of the responsible Creek authorities,” or was “ with their (responsible Creek authorities) cognizance and acquiescence.” In other words, Congress made the Creek Nation, which could act only through its responsible officers, liable in the event the overt acts of those officers themselves or their supineness occasioned the loss—on the theory that the nation should be liable for the acts of commission of disorder of its authorities or the deliberate omissions to maintain law and order of the tribal authorities where injury was occasioned thereby. The Creek Nation made a contract of lease that their supreme court had held was lawful, that lease was assigned or transferred regularly in accordance with tribal custom. Quiet enjoyment and possession of the leased premises was a covenant of the contract as much as though expressly written therein. When the Creek people, with the active aid of some of their highest authorities and the cognizance and acquiescence of all the Creek authorities, forcibly committed a breach of that contract, it became right and proper that Congress, as having plenary power in the premises, should afford the means of legal redress for the breach of the contract made in behalf of the whole people. Upon a demise of property the law implies a covenant of quiet enjoyment. Lutz v. Linthicum, 6 Peters, 165-76; Scott v. Rutherford, 92 U. S., 107-9. The rule is to declare liability where a mob, actuated wholly by lawlessness and defiant of the constituted authorities, has swept away the authorities seeking to maintain the peace and has destroyed property despite the earnest efforts of the authorities. County of Allegheny v. Gibson, 90 Pa. St., 397. See also Solomon v. City of Kingston, 31 N. Y., 565. In Spring Valley Coal Co. v. City of Spring Valley, 65 Ill. App., 571, the court reversed the lower court on the ground that the jury had rendered a wrongful verdict in favor of the city through prejudice and passion against the coal company. The suit was one brought for failure to afford protection to the company’s store during a strike and its incidental disturbances. See also Darlington v. Mayor, 31 N. Y., 164; Luke v. City of Brooklyn, 43 Barbour (N. Y.), 54; Ely v. Co. of Niagara, 36 N. Y., 167; Moore's Int. Law, p. 839. The damages suffered by claimant are of easy ascertainment and easy of legal determination. Obviously claimant being entitled to recover should be awarded the amount of actual net loss occasioned by destruction of the labor and materials entering into construction of the fence. That such loss is the natural consequence of the breach of the peace and of the contract and of the tort committed is not open to doubt. In such cases this court has held compensation is the loss of profits that otherwise would have accrued. North Platte Canal Co. v. United States, 48 Ct. Cls., 282. Mr. R. 0.

       "  'case_summary': \"ELIZA I. CURTIN ET AL. v. NITTANY V. R. CO. APPEAL BY DEPENDANT EROM THE COURT OE COMMON PLEAS OE CENTRE COUNTY. Argued April 23, 1890 Decided May 12, 1890. [To be reported.] 1. In the assessment of damages for land taken or injured in the exercise of the right of eminent domain, the market value of the property, before and after the injury, cannot be ascertained by evidence of particular sales, under special circumstances, of other properties alleged to be similarly situated. 2. It is competent to adduce testimony as to all matters hearing upon the location, condition and quality of the land in question, and show the general selling price of land in the neighborhood, as data from which the jury may determine the market value, but evidence of particular sales is not admissible. (а) In a proceeding to assess such damages, the court charged that the market value of the land in question might be ascertained by sales of land adjoining, and, when there had been no public sales, from the opinion of men of experience and judgment who were acquainted with the property: 3. Such instruction could not be complained of by a party who brought out the only testimony, respecting particular sales, to which it could apply; but it was not erroneous, when, in view of the general tenor of the charge, the reference was plainly to the general selling price, and not to any particular sales. 4. If additional fencing is made necessary by the location and construction of a railroad through a tract of land, the increased burden of fencing thus cast upon the land may be considered in assessing the owner’s damages, hut only so far as it depreciates the market value of. the property. (б) The local act of April 9,1868, P. L. 779, makes it the duty of railroad companies in the counties to which it applies, to fence their roads, and in default thereof renders them liable for the value of any horses, cattle, sheep or swine injured in consequence of such neglect. It also imposes a pecuniary penalty for neglect to keep up the fences required : 5. Notwithstanding this act, a jury assessing land damages, in a county governed by it, 'may consider whether the construction of a railroad through a farm necessitates a change of internal or additional fencing, to render it convenient for use as a farm, and whether such necessity easts upon it a burden detracting from its market value. 6. A farmer, living a few miles distant, who has known a farm for forty years, seeing the greater part of it in passing and repassing upon the public road, has been upon it and at the buildings, and knows the gen eral selling price of land in the neighborhood, is a competent witness as to market value, under the test laid down in Pittsburgh etc. Ry. Co. v. Vance, 115 Pa. 331. Before Paxson, C. J., Sterrett, Green, Clark, Williams and Mitchell, JJ. No. 75 January Term 1890, Sup. Ct.; court below, No. 12 November Term 1887, C. P. On August 27,1887, the plaintiffs, Eliza I. Curtin and others, petitioned the court below for the appointment of viewers to assess damages alleged to have arisen from the location and construction, by the Nittany Valley Railroad Company, of a railroad upon and across a certain farm belonging to them. Viewers were accordingly appointed, who afterwards reported assessing damages to the plaintiffs in the sum of $3,800. On October 12,1887, the plaintiffs appealed from the award, and thereupon an issue, in the nature of an action of trespass quare clausum fregit, to determine what amount of compensation, if any, the plaintiffs were entitled to receive from the defendant by reason of said location and construction, was framed by order of the court, the plaintiffs filing a declaration in the usual form and the defendant pleading not guilty. At the trial on February 5, 1889, the following facts were shown: The plaintiffs’ farm, which was situated near to the borough of Bellefonte, contained about 402 acres. It was underlaid with iron ore, which the firm of Curtins & Co. had the right to mine and take out, paying to the plaintiffs as owners of the farm a royalty of twenty cents per ton. The railroad of the defendant was laid through the farm in an irregular line shaped somewhat like the letter S, so as to leave 34 acres of cleared land and 90 acres of woodland, to the south of it, and the remainder of the farm with the main buildings upon the northern side. Witnesses for the plaintiffs testified that in order properly to use the tract as a farm it would be necessary to fence both sides of the railroad, the amdunt of fencing required for that purpose being about one and one half miles. The plaintiff called as a witness, Isaiah Struble, who testified as follows: Q. Where do you live ? A. I live near Zion, in Walker town ship. Q. What is your occupation? A. Farmer. Q. How long have you lived in that vicinity? A. Since the year 1839. Q. Are you acquainted with this Curtin farm? A. Yes, sir. Q. How long have you been acquainted with it? A. I have been acquainted with it for the last forty years. Q. To what extent have you been acquainted with it? A. Well, I never was over the farm much, but I noticed the crops that were raised on there, especially while Mr. White lived on it. Cross-examination: Q. You say you noticed the crops that grew in the fields along the Fishing Creek road? A. Well, you can see over the greater part of the farm from the Fishing Creek road. Q. Have you been over the northern part of the farm and noticed the crops there specially? A. No, sir; not very much over the part north of the railroad. Q. Have you ever been up at the farm buildings ? A. Yes, sir; I have been to the old buildings. Q. How often have you been there? A. I couldn’t tell you how often; I have' been there frequently. Q. You say you were not over the whole northern part? A. Not over the whole northern part. By the court: Were you acquainted with the market value of property in the neighborhood before this railroad was built ? A. I don’t know of much property having been sold in that neighborhood. Q. Did you know the value of this property before this railroad was located there ? A. Nothing more than my own impressions. I have only got that to go by. Mr. Gephart: Do you know anything about sales of property in that neighborhood; do you know of any farms being sold there ? A. The farms that have been sold there didn’t bring near their value. By the court: Do you have such knowledge of this property that jmu know the general value of this land? A. Well, I thought I did; yes, sir. Mr. Gephart: We submit, your Honor, he is not such an expert as to the value of land in this immediate neighborhood as to qualify him to express an opinion as to the market value. Mr. Orvis: State, Mr. Struble, if you know how this Nittany Valle3r railroad runs through this farm. A. Yes, sir; I do know that. Q. State what the effect of the location and of the construction of that railroad through the farm upon the value of the farm has been. Mr. G-ephart: Defendant’s counsel object to the witness answering the question, because from the preliminary examination he is not so acquainted with the market value of the land, in the vicinity of the property in question, as enables him to give an opinion as to how the market value is affected by the location of the road through the property. By the court: As we understand the testimony of Mr. Struble, he is a farmer living in this same valley, several miles below the farm which is the subject of controversy in this case; that he has been acquainted with the farm for forty years, passing and repassing it coming to and going from Bellefonte ; that he has been on the farm; that he has been on the northern part of it, at the buildings, and he states that he has a general knowledge of the value of the farm; he is not called as an expert, but to state the value of the farm from his knowledge, and the injury it has sustained by reason of the location of this road. We think that he is competent to testify, and therefore admit the evidence; exception.4 The witness then testified that in his judgment the farm was depreciated in value in consequence of the building of the railroad through it, and placed an estimate- upon the amount of the depreciation. Other witnesses testified for the plaintiffs to the same effect. Some of the plaintiffs’ witnesses were interrogated by the defendant’s counsel, upon cross-examination, respecting sales of other lands in the neighborhood, such examination bringing out the fact that an adjoining tract known as the Bernhart farm had been sold at a public sale, within two years, for $50 per acre, and that a small piece of land, part of what was known as the McAllister farm, adjoining the borough of Bellefonte, had sold at $200 per acre. The defendant put in evidence the local act of April 9, 1868, P. L. 779, making it the duty of every company owning or operating a railroad in the county of Centre, to erect and maintain a fence five feet high on each side of its tracks, except in villages, boroughs and cities, and at public road crossings, and to construct and maintain suitable cattle guards at all crossings; and providing that, upon neglect or refusal to perform this duty, the company so offending should be liable to the owner of any horses, cattle, sheep or swine injured upon its road, for the full value thereof, and liable further, to a penalty of $50 for each place where the fences required by the act were destroyed or broken down and permitted so to remain for a period of ten days, to be recovered in a qui tarn action. At the close of the testimony the court, Fujrst, P. J., after stating the case generally and reading § 11, act of February 19, 1849, P. L. 83, proceeded to charge the jury as follows: You will notice by the reading of the act of assembly that you are to compare the advantages with the disadvantages, and thereby ascertain what damages, if any, the owner of the land has sustained. Now, to make this comparison of the advantages with the disadvantages, the Supreme Court have defined just what the duty of a jury is, and what advantages are to be considered and what disadvantages are to be considered. [Before calling your attention to the rule given by the Supreme Court, let me say to you, that the first important inquiry is to ascertain the market value of the property immediately before the injury was inflicted upon it, or before the location and construction of the road. Wherever it can be ascertained by public sales of lands adjoining, the market value may be ascertained in that manner; where there have been no public sales, the market value must be ascertained from the knowledge and judgment of men who are acquainted with the property, and who by their experience and judgment can give the jury a fair, honest, and impartial opinion as to the real value of the property.]1 By these means you obtain the market value of the property immediately before the construction of the road; and after that is done, you determine, as the second inquiry, what is the market value of the property immediately after the construction of the road; the difference, if any, will constitute the true measure of damages..... You will therefore consider the advantages that are special to the property itself, over and above the general advantage that is derived from the location of the railroad through the community; you ascertain what those advantages are, and you set over against that the disadvantages that this property is subjected to. These are the advantages and disadvantages that you must make a comparison between, the one with the other; advantages that are special and disadvantages that are actual. You will apply these rules to the present case. The plaintiffs allege that by the construction of the road over this farm there are from five to five and a half acres appropriated, the entire use of which is lost to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs further allege that it is located in such a manner as to cut off some thirty-four acres of tillable land from the farm, in addition to the timber land; that it leaves that part of the farm in a very irregular shape, inconvenient for farming, and that, as to the northern portion of the tract, it leaves the southern boundary of it irregular and difficult to farm. The plaintiffs further allege that there is a great inconvenience arising out of the difficulty of crossing the line of this road; that it is located in a peculiar manner over this farm, along hillsides and over ravines, and that by reason of this it is rendered difficult to cross, thereby subjecting plaintiffs to great inconvenience and loss in the proper enjoyment of their farm. The plaintiffs further allege that it disarranges some of the interior fences of the farm, and that by virtue of the peculiar location of the road through this farm, deep cuts and high fills, that it necessitates additional fencing along the line of the road to render it safe and convenient for farming. In ascertaining the value of the property you must take into consideration the evidence as to its location, and with it the evidence of its general nature and character. Not only is it shown to be a farm tract, but it is also, shown to be a mineral tract; that quantities of iron ore have been discovered upon it; that ore works have been erected there and have been in operation for years..... [Another element of damages which the plaintiffs claim in this case is that of fencing; not, as we understand the plaintiffs’ claim, for any particular sum of money to be expended for fencing that part of the road, but the plaintiffs allege that by reason of the peculiar location of this road over the plaintiffs’ land, there is an absolute necessity to fence this road, in order to conveniently farm the place, and to protect the stock and property on the place; that this is a burden cast upon the farm which detracts from its market value. It is only in the sense that it may detract from the market value of the property that you may consider it. You do not consider, it as so much money for so many panels of fence, but you consider whether or not additional fencing is made necessary by this location of the road, and whether or not this casts a burden on the farm which detracts from its market value, and just to the extent it detracts from its market value, to that extent only you consider it in estimating the damages.] * [In this connection the defendant has submitted a point, which it is made our duty to read to you and answer. The point is as follows : Inasmuch as the special act of assembly for Centre county, approved April 9,1868, P. L. 779, provides r—“ That it shall be the duty of each company owning or operating a railroad in the county of Centre, to erect, where not already erected, and to keep and maintain on each side of the track or tracks of said road, at all places in said county, except where said road or roads passes or pass through a village, borough, or city, or a public road crosses the same, a suitable fence five feet high, and to build, erect, and maintain such suitable cattle guard or guards at all crossings on said railroad, as will prevent horses, cattle, sheep, and swine from going upon said tracks ; and in case any company, owning or operating said road or roads, shall refuse or neglect to perform the duties herein imposed, the company or companies so offending shall be answerable to the owner or owners of any horses, cattle, sheep, or swine to the full value of the property injured upon said road or roads, in consequence of such neglect; ”—the jury cannot allow as an element of the damages suffered by the plaintiffs the cost of erecting a fence on both sides of said railroad for the purpose of keeping the cattle of the owners, tenants, or other parties from straying upon the railroad and preventing such cattle from being killed or injured. Our answer is as follows : The cost of fencing cannot be recovered as a distinct item of damages, but the question of how much the burden of fencing will detract from the value of the land may be considered by the jury. If the location of the road through the farm be such as necessitates a change of internal fences or necessitates additional fencing, either along the line of the road or elsewhere upon the farm, so as to render it convenient for use as a farm, and if the jury believe from the evidence that this casts a burden upon the farm which detracts from its market value, then it is a proper subject to be considered by the jury; but it is to be considered in comparison with the advantages, if any, only as affecting the market value of the land. We think this is a true rule, notwithstanding the special act of assembly relating to this county. For further answer we refer to our general charge upon that subject.] 3 In determining the market value of this property, both before the construction of the railroad and since, you are not bound by the opinions of witnesses who testified as to what, in their judgment, the market value of that property is. The opinion of a witness is based upon facts, and before a witness was permitted to testify as to his opinion, he was required to give to you the facts upon which he predicates his opinion ; you have the facts upon which his opinion was based and you can draw your own opinions and conclusions from the same facts. You may differ in your opinions from the witness as to the amount or value of the property. In this case the witnesses have differed widely in their opinions ; some may have placed the value of the property, perhaps too high,—-we do not say they have,—and we say, perhaps others may have placed it too low. You have not only heard their testimony in this case, but you have been permitted to go upon the ground and view the promises. You must gather from all the evidence in the case what was the true market value of this property immediately before the construction of this road. You must then determine what was its true market value after the road was constructed upon it, and the difference would be the true measure of damages in this case. In making up that difference we have already called your attention to the specific elements which may enter into it, and it is not necessary for us again to repeat these...... The verdict of the jury was in favor of the plaintiffs for $6,162.66. Subsequently, a rule for a new trial was discharged upon condition that the plaintiffs within twenty days remit all the verdict in excess of $5,628. Within the time limited the plaintiffs filed a remittitur as specified in the order, and judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiffs for $5,628 ; whereupon the defendant took this appeal, assigning for error: 1-3. The parts of the charged embraced in [ ] 1 to 3 4. The admission of the plaintiffs’ offer.4 Mr. J. W. G-ephart (with him Mr. John M. Dale), for the appellant: 1. The court erred in the rule it laid down to govern the jury in ascertaining the market value of the property. That rule was the very reverse of the one established by a long line of decisions by this court. The court practically confined the test of value to “ sales of land adjoining,” which necessarily means particular sales, and not the general selling price in the vicinity. The charge left the jury to consider as evidence of the highest importance, what has been held utterly inadmissible. Market value cannot be shown by evidence of particular sales of alleged similar properties : Searle v. Railroad Co., 33 Pa. 57; Pittsburgh etc. R. Co. v. Patterson, 107 Pa. 461; Pittsburgh etc. Ry. Co. v. Vance, 115 Pa. 331. 2. In substantially holding that the special act of April 9, 1868, P. L. 779, requiring all railroad companies to fence their roads in Centre county, made no change in the measure of damages, and that the jury could consider the item of fencing just as if that act was not in force, the court committed error to the great injury of the defendant. The effect of the ruling is to compel the defendant to pay the cost of fencing the road as part of the damages for right of way, and, after so doing, still to remain bound to keep up the fence. This is neither right nor just; nor was it the intention of the legislature to impose such a double burden on the company. The duty of fencing is made imperative by the act, and the burden is shifted from the landowner to the railroad company. 3. The preliminary examination of Isaiah Struble showed that he was not sufficiently familiar with the entire property in question, and the market value of land in the vicinity, to render him competent to give an opinion as to the amount of damages. The very language used by Mr. Justice Clauk, in Pittsburgh etc. Ry. Co. v. Vance, 115 Pa. 332, can for the most part be applied to this witness. There can be very little • doubt that a very considerable part of the verdict is due to the testimony of incompetent witnesses like Struble, and to the instructions of the court upon the subject of evidence of par tieular sales and the question of the defendant’s liability for a fund to erect and keep in repair fences along its road. Mr. John H. Orvis (with him Mr. O. M. Bower and Mr. Bilis L. Orvis~), for the appellees: 1. The sentences of the charge which are the subject of the first assignment of error, contain a severely accurate statement of the law, even when separated from the context. The market value of a thing is what it sells for in market. But it is not fair to consider. extracts from the charge by themselves. In other parts of this charge the rule is laid down so fully and accurately, that the jury could not have been misled by the language assigned for error, even if it had been an inaccurate statement of the rule. If there is any error in that part of the charge, the defendant’s counsel are responsible for it, as they brought out the testimony respecting particular sales, and the plaintiffs alone have the right to complain, as they alone are injured by it. 2. The necessity of fencing is still a burden on the owners of farms in Centre county, notwithstanding the local act of April 9,1868, P. L. 779. A fence along the railroad is needed for other purposes, besides the prevention of the owner’s cattle from straying upon the road and getting killed, and if the railroad company does not choose to build a fence, the farmer must protect his crops by doing so himself. The question whether additional fencing was made necessary by the location and construction of the railroad, was properly submitted, and the jury received proper instructions as to the manner in which they should deal with this item of fencing: Montour R. Co. v. Scott, 11 W. N. 51; Pittsburgh etc. Ry. Co. v. McCloskey, 110 Pa. 486. 8. The remedy for the hardship complained of in the argument for the defendant, in connection with the matter of fencing, is simple and easy of application. Let it in good faith obey the law, by fencing its road and putting in the necessary cattle guards, and then it will neither have to pay for any cattle killed by its cars, nor will it encounter the question of fencing as an element in the computation of the land damages. As to the admission of plaintiffs’ offer, if Isaiah Struble was not a competent witness, it will be difficult to find witnesses in a case like this. It is not necessaiy, to render a witness competent, that he should have gone over the land field by-field, and acre by acre. All that the decision in Pittsburgh etc. Ry. Co. v. Vance, 115 Pa. 332, means is, that a person not acquainted with a property is incompetent to give an opinion as to its value. * The word “public ” was in the printed charge, but omitted from its place in that part copied in the assignment of error.\",\n",

All the erections connected with a cotton factory, and other mills propelled by water-power, including the dams, water wheels, and gearing, and machinery fastened to the ground or buildings, are prima facie a part of the realty, and descend to the heir at law of the owner, upon his death, and do not pass to his executors or administrators as a part of his personal estate. They will also pass to the remainderman, as between him and the tenant for life. Beal property, purchased for partnership purposes, with partnership funds, and which remains after paying the debts of the firm, and adjusting the equitable claims of the different members of the firm, as between themselves, is considered and treated as real estate. The grantee or vendee of a tenant by the curtesy has all the rights of a tenant for life ; and in respect to erections placed upon the premises by him for the purposes of trade, the question is substantially between a tenant for life and the remainderman. The seisin of one tenant in common is the seisin of the others. Accordingly, where a person, in right of his wife, became a partner with others in the ownership of a cotton factory and other mills, and in the management of the business thereof, and received a proportionate share of the profits from the time his wife became interested in the property, until after her death; held, that this was a sufficient seisin of the wife to consummate the estate by the curtesy in the husband. The rule in this state, as between grantor and grantee, vendor and vendee, mortgagor and mortgagee, and heir and personal representative of the deceased, is that whatever is annexed or affixed to the freehold, by being let into the soil or annexed to it, or to some erection upon it, to be habitually used there, particularly if for the purpose of enjoying the realty, or some profit therefrom, is a part of the freehold. Where a devisee is the heir of the testator, he will take by descent, and not as purchaser, unless a different estate is given him, or there is a conversion; even if there is a charge upon the realty. Where a testator directs that all his just debts and funeral expenses shall be paid by his executors, the charge is confined to property given to the executors. And if there is a devise of land to them, such land is chargeable with debts, unless otherwise specifically and entirely appropriated by the will. Where a testator, by the residuary clause of his will, gives all the rest and residue of his estate and effects, real and personal, not therein otherwise effectually disposed of, after payment of his debts, legacies, funeral expenses, and other charges therein authorized, to his daughter, this creates a charge upon the residwwm, in case there is a deficiency of personal property. A charge merely, does not alter the rights of the parties to the realty, until enforced. Nor does a devise of lands in trust to sell and pay debts and legacies, if the devisee can not receive the rents and profits. Much less does a mere power to sell. In Equity. The hill in this cause was filed in December, 1847, and prayed that the copartnership of Wm. Mowry & Co. might be declared dissolved; an account taken of the assets thereof; the respective rights of the parties to the suit be ascertained and settled; and that the property might be divided or sold, the proper persons joining in the conveyance, and the proceeds divided according to their respective interests. In 1806, Wm. Mowry and Wm. Casey owned three-fourths of a cotton factory and other buildings in Greenwich, Washington county, U. Y. on the Battenkill. In 1807 they purchased of one Pettys over 14 acres lying on the Battenkill, in Greenwich and Easton. Upon this they built a cotton factory, and carried it on under the style and firm of “ Wm. Mowry & Co.” In 1808 Mowry & Casey conveyed one-third of all their interest in the property and concern to John Gale, and took him in as an equal partner. In January, 1812, Casey’s interest was sold upon an execution, and bid off by John D. Dickinson. In March of that year Mowry & Gale released to D. all claim upon Casey’s part of the property and admitted D. as a member of the firm. In August, 1812, D. by a deed and by assignment, transferred all his interest to Townsend McCoun, who was also thereupon admitted as a member of the firm. In December, 1812, Mowry conveyed a moiety of his interest in all the property, real and personal, to Samuel McCoun. In February, 1820, Whipple and others conveyed to said parties the remaining one-fourth of the land owned by Mowry & Casey in 1806. They also released all right to the 14 acres purchased of Pettys. This conveyance, and the release, were to Mowry, one-sixth; Gale, one-third; T. McCoun, one-third; and S. McCoun, one-sixth. The release recited that a dam across the Battenkill was mostly in the 14 acres, and valuable improvements had been made since Pettys conveyed it, by erecting a factory and other machinery on this parcel. And that disputes had arisen about the use of the water, &c. and that the releasees, naming them, “ under the firm Wm. Mowry & Co. claimed to be seised of an absolute, indefeasible estate of inheritance in fee simple of and in the said premises, with the appurtenances, and of and in the privilege of draining water from said pond for any and every use and purpose they may deem proper, either for manufacturing, milling or otherwise, in the following proportions, viz. Wm. Mowry, one-sixth ; John Gale, one-third; Townsend McCoun, one-third, and Samuel McCoun, one-sixth.” In September, 1822, Samuel Gale purchased John Gale’s part at a marshal’s sale, on an execution against John. January 1st, 1825, Bethel Mather conveyed-to W. Mowry, one-sixth, to T. McCoun one-third, to S. McCoun one-sixth, to Samuel Gale one-third of over 3 acres of land on which were a grist mill, saw mill and carding machine, with all the tools, utensils and machinery used about the same, and certain water power ; by 4 separate deeds, one to each. On the 29th day of January, 1825, the two McCouns, S. Gale and W. Mowry entered into a stipulation or agreement under seal, in which they recited the fact of the last purchase, and that they had received deeds of their respective shares and proportions, to which and other papers reference was made, and then added as follows : “ Now therefore to the end that the objects and intentions of the parties may more fully now and hereafter be understood, we hereby mutually and severally covenant and agree with each other, for ourselves, our heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, that we will hold the aforesaid late purchased lands, mills, water privileges and appurtenances, and also the buildings, water privileges and lands called the old cotton factory, situate on the. lan'd so lately purchased, but heretofore and now owned by us jointly in common for the use, benefit, interest and accommodation of our said cotton manufacturing property and works; and it is agreed that we give no preference of water privileges to said mill property or cotton factory, both works being on one dam, are equal as to water privileges, and that we will- not individually or severally use, let or lease, sell or convey our share or interest in the said late purchased premises and privileges separate and unconnected with our respective shares and interest in said cotton manufacturing property and interest. Nothing herein contained is meant or intended to hinder or prohibit the said proprietors, or either of them, from selling or conveying the whole or any part of their joint shares of said cotton manufacturing property and said last purchased mill property, joint and connected, but not otherwise.” On the 18th of November, 1825, Wm. Mowry conveyed five-sixths of another parcel of land, containing betwéen two and three acres, adjoining the parcel of 14 acres, to T. McCoun two-sixths, to S. Gale two-sixths, and to S. McCoun one-sixth. On the 25th March, 1830, Samuel McCoun died, leaving his share of this property to his son John T. McCoun. May 4th, 1830, Samuel Gale conveyed his interest to John Gale. On the 23d of December, 1834, John T. McCoun conveyed his interest to Wm. H. Mowry and Henry Holmes by two deeds. On the 21st September, 1834, Townsend McCoun died, leaving a widow and one child, Mrs. Phebe Buckley ,who was his sole heir at law. By his will he directed, first that his debts should be paid by his executors thereinafter made; second, he gave a house and lot to his wife during life, also his furniture to his wife, also an annuity of $1500, which he expressly charged upon certain lands and tenements which he specified as thereinafter devised in trust to his executors and in lieu of dower ; third, he gave certain real estate to his daughter in fee. Also other real estate for life, remainder to her children living at his death. Also after the death of his wife, an annuity of $750 during life to her sole and separate use, and made this a charge upon his real estate devised in trust to his executors ; fourth, he devised to his executors by name, not including his wife, several parcels of real estate and certain bank stock, subject to and charged with the payment of said annuities to his wife and daughter, and in trust to pay the same and to invest the balance to accumulate, &c. for the children of his daughter, and to make an equitable division to be paid as they became of age, &c. and any portion of real estate set off to a child, to be liable for a fair proportion of the annuities, &c. with power to sell in the discretion of the trustees, subject to the annuities, &c.; fifth, he devised his lot and store in Troy, to his grandsons. sons of his daughter, born and to be born ; sixth, he disposed of a farm in Orange county, the use to D. so long as she occupied it, with remainder to his daughter in fee; seventh, he gave certain legacies to the children of Samuel McCoun; eighth, a legacy, to his sister, payable in one year after his death. And the ninth clause of the will was as follows: “ All the rest and residue of my estate and effects, real and personal, not herein before otherwise effectually disposed of, (after payment of my debts and legacies, funeral expenses and other charges herein authorized,) I do give, devise and bequeath unto my said daughter, Phebe Buckley, her heirs and assigns forever.” Tenth, he made his wife and four others, his executrix and executors. The daughter, Phebe Buckley, died March 15, 1838, leaving six children made defendants in this cause, all then being under age but one. Phinehas H. Buckley, her husband, took out letters of administration upon her estate. After the death of Townsend McCoun, Phinehas H. Buckley became a member of the fizun of Mowry & Co. and so continued until the 12th day of August, 1845, when he conveyed all his interest in all this property and his interest in the copartnership, to the plaintiff John L. Buckley, his brother, for the consideration expressed in the deed of $10,000. It appeared that Phinehas had become insolvent, and that his indebtedness to the plaintiff, which was the consideration of the conveyance, was pre-existing. Wm. Mowry died in March, 1845, and devised all his “right, being an undivided sixth part of all the estate real and personal, stock in trade and debts due, of, in and to the firm of Wm. Mowry &. Co. called the Washington Cotton Factory,” &c. to his daughter Cazoline Holmes, who was the wife of the defendant Henry Holmes. John Gale died in September, 1846, leaving a wife and five children. He left a will of which the following is a copy. “ In the name of God, Amen. I John Gale, of the town of Greenwich, in the county of Washington and state of New-York, being of sound mind and memory, do make and publish this my last will and testament in manner following, viz. I order and direct my just debts and funeral charges to be paid. I give and devise to my beloved wife Remember Mary Gale, the use and enjoyment and the rents and profits of my homestead farm, unless it should be deemed advisable by my executors and for the benefit of the estate as well as for her interest to sell it, and in that ease I authorize my executors to sell and convey the same and invest the same proceeds at interest, either in bonds and mortgages or public stocks of this state or the United States, the interest to be paid annually to my wife during her life. She is to have the use of all the household furniture, and at her decease to be equally divided between my four daughters or their heirs. I also direct my executors, after my debts are all paid, to pay my wife from dividends made from the cotton factory, if made to that amount, two hundred dollars annually. And I further direct that my wife shall be furnished with the bread-stuff she may require for family use from my mill in Easton, and this be considered a lien on said mill. I further direct, (should) my wife require further support, the executors to pay her the one half of what may be considered a fair rent of my brick store in the mill lot, which building I own independent of the original joint purchase. I direct my executors to pay William Gale and Sarah D. Gale one thousand dollars each, and Caroline M. Townsend three hundred, she having received up to April 9th, 1840, seven hundred dollars ; all sums since received, if any, to be deducted. My daughter Elizabeth has already received one thousand. The executors are directed to pay Juliana Gale, Sarah D. Gale and Caroline M. Townsend the sums thus above directed to be paid to them from the first moneys collected after paying all my debts. In the mean time they must be furnished with such aid as may be necessary to render them comfortable until the various sums can be raised, to pay the full amount as directed. I direct my executors, as soon as my debts are all paid and any portion of my real estate can be sold without sacrifice, to pay over to each of my four daughters, Elizabeth, Juliana, Caroline M. and Sarah D., two thousand dollars. The executors are directed to invest the several sums of two thousand dollars each either in stock of the United States or of the state of New-York, or on bond and mortgage or valuable real estate, the interest to be paid over to each one annually; and at the decease of either of the daughters without heirs, the' interest in the sums thus bequeathed to be equally divided between the survivors or their heirs. Elizabeth is to receive the interest during her life, and the principal to be equally divided between her children at her decease. I give and bequeath to my son Frederick A. Gale, my equal undivided half part of the mills, buildings and land, with all water privileges appertaining thereto, on the east side of Battenkill in the town of Easton, upon conditions, viz.: the said F. A. Gale is to take possession of the bove described premises, to superintend and manage the same prudently, and the net revenue arising therefrom, or from any portion of my real and personal estate, shall be appropriated to the extinguishment of the debts due from my estate at the time of my decease. When the debts are all paid F. A. Gale is to come into immediate possession of the mill property as above described. The brick building now occupied as a store is owned by me independent of the original purchase of the mill lot which I also include in the devise to the said F. A. Gale, subject to the conditions following, viz. should any circumstances occur which would render it necessary that either my wife or daughter should receive aid, through misfortune or untoward causes, such a portion of the rent shall be paid as directed in my second section of this will. 6th. When the debts are all paid or arranged, with the legacies, I direct that my step-son Amander B. Sherman, one of my executors, shall be paid out of my estate four hundred dollars, in addition to the payment of a certain note given him some years past for six hundred dollars; and while he remains unmarried he may board in the family, free from expense. My property consists mostly in real estate. My directions and advice to my executors are to exercise sound discretion in the management; to sell such portions, when fair prices can be obtained, but not suffer yourselves to be driven into a sale of any part to disadvantage by any of the heirs, but at the same time they must be assisted to an equal share of any surplus revenue until a final close can be made and the devises are all paid on a final settlement. Should there be a deficit to meet all the bequests, an equal deduction is to be made from each. I do hereby nominate and appoint my step-son Amander B. Sherman, with my son Frederick A. Gale and Ezra Thompson Gale, executors of this my last will and testament; and I hereby expressly revoke all and every former wills by me made. In case of the absence or refusal to serve of either of my executors, I hereby authorize the remaining executor or executors to execute any of the powers conferred by this will.” The plaintiff claimed as assignee of purchaser from Phinehas II. Buckley. At the time of filing the bill, four parcels of this property, a wagon shop, pail factory, blacksmith’s shop, dry house, and another parcel, had been leased for years, under which leases the occupants then held. The cotton factory, weaver’s shop, grist mill and saw mill, &c. were not leased. The answers of the children of Phebe Buckley admitted that Phinehas Buckley entered into possession of the property as a member of the firm, and acted as such and received dividends, but that he avowed he was a tenant for life only. It appeared by some of the annual settlements given in evidence, that the purchase money paid for the lands conveyed by Mather and wife was paid from the profits of the firm, $2000 in 1825, nearly $3000 in 1826, more than $2500 in 1827 — the principal being about 7000 dollars. A grist mill was built or generally repaired in 1827. In 1830 the company purchased about $400 worth of machinery. In 1831 and 1832 they expended nearly $9000 for mills, and over $1000 in repairing dam, &c. and received over $4500 from insurance companies. The difference was paid out of partnership funds. In 1833 they purchased one house and built another at an expense of $600, and also purchased and repaired machinery, and the total expense that year was over $1500, paid by the company. During the time Phinehas H. Buckley was a partner, they expended for machinery and repairs about $14,000, of which the machinery was the greater part, and about $2500 in building — and among other erections a wagon shop. The saw mill was rebuilt about 1839. The earnings during the same period were over $20,000. The expenditures for the repairs, &c. since the plaintiff had been a partner were not given, except for the year ending April,1846; the repairs, new machinery and building being nearly $1400 that year, and the net earnings nearly $6,500. The bill was taken as confessed against all the defendants, except the children of Mrs. Phebe Buckley. T. C. T. Buckley, for the plaintiff. Walter Rutherford, for the heirs of Mrs. Buckley.\",\n",

       "  'case_summary': 'Rhines v. The Chicago & Northwestern Railway Company. 1. Railroads: deficient fence: stock killed: evidence under instructions. In an action for double the value of horses killed on defendant’s track, where they were alleged to have gone by reason of a deficient fence, there was no evidence to show that they entered through the opening in the fence rather than at a deficient cattle-guard, except the fact that the last point to which they were traced was nearer to the opening than to the cattle-guard. Held insufficient to sustain a verdict for plaintiff on the cause of action pleaded,- where the court instructed that he could not recover unless he proved that they entered through the opening. [Beck, J., dissenting]. 2. Appeal: instructions : review. The instructions given on the trial are the law of the case for the jury, and the appellee in this court cannot be heard to say that they are wrong, in order to avoid a reversal on the ground that the verdict of the jury is in conflict therewith. 3. Railroads: duty to fence depot grounds : question for jury. The law is that railroads are required to be fenced when it is fit, proper and suitable, in view of the public convenience ; and depot grounds may be uninclosed when the interests of the road and of the public require it (Latty v. Burlington, C. B. & M. By. Co., 38 Iowa, 250); but whether a part of depot grounds which was not the ordinary place for receiving and delivering freight, but where the freight business of a single shipper was transacted, should be left uninclosed, was a question of fact for the jury.

       "  'case_summary': 'J. R. Sims v. The State. No. 868. Decided June 3rd, 1896. 1. Murder—Arraignment—Special Venire. Arts. 544, et. seq., Code Crim. Proc.,. provide that a defendant cannot be arraigned until two entire days after he has been served with a copy of the indictment, in order that he may have an opportunity to present all necessary exceptions and demurrers, to the indictment. But, these statutes do not require that a special venire should have been summoned, and that the jury should be present when the defendant is arraigned. 2. Same—Change of Venue. A motion for change of venue may be heard and determined before the parties, have announced ready for trial; and, it is not required that a special venire should have been drawn and summoned before the motion for change of venue can be acted . upon. 3. Same—Impeachment of Witness—Contradictory Statements. On a trial for murder, where a witness’ testimony is in conflict with and contradictory to, his previous statements, his testimony taken at the inquest and examining trials, is competent to show that he had made the same or similar statements, shortly after the occurrence, as those testified to by him as a witness upon the stand; and, it makes no difference that those other statements were made under oath in the previous examinations. 4. Same—Evidence—Dying Declarations. On a trial for murder, where it appeared that deceased was shot at 8 or 9 o’clock a. m.; died about 1 or 2 o’clock p. m.; that he was suffering greatly during the time; that at no time did he express a hope of recovery; that his physician had informed him there was no chance for him to recover; that his daughter threw her arms about him, aud began crying, when he remarked to her, “All is well.” Held: His declarations were properly admitted as dying declarations. 5. Same. Statements made by the deceased just after he was shot and subsequently before his death, to the effect that, “Sims ought not to have shot me:” and, “I didn’t think that Sims was going to shoot,” are admissible as dying declarations. 6. Same—Presence of Jury When Predicate for is Laid. While the predicate, for the admission of dying declarations, is always primarily a question for the court, still it is the better practice to have the jury hear all the testimony in this connection, so they may be fully advised of the circumstances under which the dying declarations were made. 7. Change of Venue—Rearraignment and Plea. Where the venue has been changed, and the party has been arraigned, and has pleaded in the county where the prosecution began, it is not necessary that he should be rearraigned and required to plead in the county to which the venue has been, changed. 8. Same—Reading Indictment to Jury. On a trial for murder, where the venue has been changed, and it appeared that prior thereto, in the county of the institution of the prosecution, defendant had been arraigned, the indictment having been read to him, to which his plea of not guilty had also been entered, and the indictment was not read to the jury on the trial until several of the witnesses had testified. Held, by Henderson, Judge: That it was unnecessary to read the indictment again to the jury, inasmuch as issue had already been joined upon it. Hurt, Presiding Judge, and Davidson, Judge, decline to express an opinion upon this point, as it is not likely to arise again. 9. Same—Defense of Property—Charge. • On a trial for murder, where one of the defenses was, that the homicide was in defense of property against an unlawful and violent attack upon it, and the charge of the court made the possession of defendant depend upon his “rightful possession.” Held: Erroneous—under Penal Code, Art. 680, Subdiv. 2, the possession is only required to be “legal;” and a possession might be a “legal” one, though not founded in right and not a “rightful” one; and where there was some question as to who was the owner, and had the right of possession to the property, such a charge was calculated to prejudice the defendant. 10. Same—Resorting to Other Means—Charge. Where one of the defenses was an unlawful attack upon property (attempting to remove a fence), and there was some testimony suggesting that defendant could have resorted to an injunction. Held: That a charge of the court instructing the jury that, before defendant could rely upon self-defense, in protection of property, he should “have resorted to every effort in his power, except killing the deceased,” should have eliminated the matter of the injunction and have told the jury that defendant was not required to resort to that measure. 11. Same—Self-defense Against a Trespasser. One, who is the owner and in possession of property, has a right to use such force as is necessary to prevent a forcible trespass upon it; and, if in doing so, he is compelled to kill, he is justifiable. And where a trespasser goes upon the property with intent and with the means to commit a felony, if necessary to accomplish the end intended, the owner of the property may repel force by force. 12. Same—Charge. Where a controversy between the parties grew out of the deceased’s demand for, and insistance upon his right to remove a fence of which defendant was in possession, and deceased came with employees and armed with a shotgun, manifesting his intention to remove the fence. Held: Defendant was not bound to retreat; was not bound t.o resort to any other means than such as were at his command at the time; and, if it became necessary, in order to repel the force used by deceased while he was in the very act of his unlawful and violent attack upon the fence, to kill him, he could not be convicted of any offense; and the charge should have so instructed the jury in effect; and further, that if they believed, that defendant was in possession of the fence, then he had the right to protect it and prevent its removal; and, if, while he was doing only what was necessary to prevent said removal, deceased made an assault upon him with his gun, causing him reasonable apprehension of his life or serious bodily injury, then defendant would have the right to slay deceased. Appeal from the District Court of Victoria. Tried below before Hon. S. F. Grimes. Appellant, by indictment found by the grand jury of Calhoun County, was charged with the murder of Louis Foster on the 2nd day of October, 1894. The indictment was returned into court in Calhoun County on the 13th day of November, 1894. On the 16th day of November, 1894, upon motion of the District Attorney, stating the statutory grounds, after hearing the evidence in support of the motion, the court changed the venue of the ease to Victoria County. At the time this motion was - heard and granted, the jury had been discharged, no special venire had been ordered summoned to try the case, no preliminary questions had been presented by the defendant, and neither the State nor the defendant had announced ready for trial, nor had the case been called for trial, and owing to the fact that the term of that court did not last long enough to enable the case to be tried, it could not have been tried at that term. These matters were called to the attention of the court, and objection made to the hearing of the motion and acting upon it then, made by the defendant, but they were overruled and the venue changed. At the first term of the court thereafter in Victoria County, exception to the jurisdiction of that court was made by the defendant, and motion \"made to return the case to the County of Calhoun. This motion was overruled by the court. The case was continued for two terms by the defendant, and at the November term, 1895, it came on to be tried. The evidence in the case shows that Sims was II. C. Clark’s agent, and in charge of his ranch in Victoria and Calhoun Counties, and rightfully, as such agent and manager, in possession of the lands in Clark’s pasture and the fence, upon the line of which the homicide occurred. The evidence shows that the fence which divides the lands of Louis Foster and H. C. Clark, and upon which the homicide occurred, was built in 18Y6 by Jacob Gamer, a former owner of the pasture that Clark owned at the time of the homicide. It further shows that the fence was placed thereby Garner under instructions from W. H. Allen, a surveyor of Victoria County, who had been employed by Garner to fix the line for the fence. Allen told Garner that the southwest line of his (Garner’s) land was twenty varas outside the line where the fence was built, so that the fence as built left a strip of twenty varas in width outside of Garner’s enclosure, and inside the pasture enclosure of Louis Foster. Garner testified that he had held possession of all the land inside his enclosure and of the fence, up to the time he had sold the land to Regan, who sold to the Traylors, who sold to Clark, that he had also had possession while the land was owned by Regan and the Traylors, for them, and that during the time he had been in possession he had never heard his title questioned. Clark testified that he had bought the land and the fence from the Traylors in 1888 or 1889, that he had always claimed all the land in the enclosure and the fence, and had never heard his title questioned until about 1891, when Foster, having bought the adjoining surveys on the southwest of his land, or an interest in them, set up claim to a strip of land inside his pasture. It was in evidence that on one occasion, Louis Foster, Jr., the son of deceased, told Sims that he was going to put cattle in Clark’s pasture, claiming the right to do so upon the ground that his father had land inside the pasture, that Sims told him not to do so until he could write to Mr. Clark, who lived in Dallas, about it. That he did write to Mr. Clark, who instructed him to allow Foster to put them in, upon condition that he (Clark) was allowed by Foster to put a like number in Foster’s pasture later on in the season, when he (Clark) might need pasturage. This was not agreed to. Louis. Foster, the son, put into the pasture 100 head of cattle, or beeves, and shortly thereafter Sims turned them back into Foster’s pasture. It further appeared, that on one occasion, Clark offered to give Foster the land he claimed inside his pasture, about 300 acres, for a strip of about fifty acres, upon the upper side of Foster’s pasture, which Clark wanted, so as to straighten his line of fence. This proposition was declined by Foster, who still insisted that the land, inside Clark’s pasture that he claimed was his and that when he got ready he was going to take it. There was evidence that Foster had on one occasion said that the land was his, and that he was going to take it with a shotgun when he got. ready, and that that thing Sims could not stop him. Also that he had used threatening expressions against Sims, about an animal that Sims had by mistake branded in Clark’s brand, that belonged to Foster, but which he had almost immediately counter-branded when the mistake was discovered. During the week before the homicide, Foster sent Peter Barnes with hands inside Clark’s pasture to dig post holes along the line he claimed up to, with the purpose of removing the line of fence to that line and rebuilding it there. Sims saw the men in the pasture and ordered them out and pulled up the posts. This was reported to Mr. Foster. Foster was killed on Tuesday. On Monday Sims met two of Barnes’ hands going down towards Foster’s, from Victoria. When asked their business they replied that they were going down to build the fence for Foster. Sims told them they could not build it, and that he would meet them there. Sims was in the habit of wearing his pistol when on the ranch. Tuesday morning early, Laurence Price, Richmond Hubbard and Elijah Barnes, three hired hands of Peter Barnes, drove a wagon over to the fence. There they were met by Sims, who asked them wrhat they were there for, and they replied that they were waiting for Peter Barnes and Mr. Foster to start to work. Soon Peter Barnes and Foster came up. Foster was armed with a double-barreled shotgun. He came to the fence post where Sims was sitting on his horse, and after greeting had passed between them, he asked the men why they were not at work. They replied that they were waiting for him to come to start them. He then told Peter Barnes to take down the fence; Barnes refused to do so. Sims told him not to touch the fence; Barnes said that if Mr. Foster would take it down he would go over. Foster then took the pincers to pull the staples, and Sims fold him that he had been instructed by Mr. Clark not to let the fence be taken down or removed, and further, that if he, Foster, was not an old man, that he would show him that he could not take the fence down. According to the witnesses for the State, Foster then said, “Oh, pshaw, Sims, you wouldiVl^ferhJ^ fly.” According to d was in the act of pulling the second staple, and in a stooping position, with his hat flopped down over his eyes, and his pipe in his mouth, when Sims shot. According to Sims’ testimony, Foster took his gun from between his knees, where he had it while pulling the top staple, cocked it and poked it up in his face, when he fired his pistol. The State’s witnesses, the three colored men, Barnes, Price and Hubbard, said that Foster laid his gun down two steps away, when he went to the fence, and did not have it in his hands at all after he laid it down. The State’s witnesses contradicted themselves and each other in many material points; Barnes was impeached by showing statements made by him at other times. There was but one shot fired, and Sims’ horse having pulled away from him, as he dismounted when in the act of shooting, he walked to Lavaca, and gave himself up to the deputy sheriff. Sims met Williams on the edge of town, and told him that he shot Foster because Foster had tried to shoot him, and he believed that Foster did shoot. He testified that he shot Foster to save his own life. There was but one shot fired. When the jury had been selected, the State, without reading the indictment or requiring any ¡flea from the defendant, proceeded to introduce the testimony on behalf of the State, and continued until the State rested. The defendant then introduced his testimony and rested; then, after the introduction of a part of the rebutting testimony, the State’s attorney was permitted to read the indictment, and a plea of not guilty was entered for the defendant, he having, under advice of his counsel, refused to plead. The State’s attorney did not, after the indictment had been read and the plea entered, offer to introduce again, the evidence that had been heard by the jury before the indictment was read, nor was it ever reintroduced. The dying declarations of the deceased, Foster, were proven for the State by Dr. C. F. Scott and John Clark. Before their testimony was admitted the jury were retired, and testimony heard to determine its admissibility. Dr. Scott then stated, “That he reached Foster’s house at about 9 or 10 . o’clock a. m., and found Foster in the wagon; had him moved into the house; examined his wound, pronounced it fatal, which statement was heard by Foster’s daughter who embraced Foster, and began to weep, and Foster stated to her, ‘Do not weep; all is well.’ Foster died at about 1 o’clock in the afternoon. After I told Foster that his wound was fatal, he made this statement: ‘Sims ought not to have shot me,’ and after-wards he stated ‘that he did not think that Sims was going to shoot.’ When I told Foster the wound was fatal, he was’then in a dying condition, and seemed to realize his condition. He did not express any hope of recovery or any expectation of death. He was sane; his mind appeared to be clear, and the statements made by him were not made in reply to any question?_r\" pounded to him, or in reply to any questions, but were all made After I had examined deceased and his wound, he being th^^^^^^J^-ess, so as to support him in a sitting position, the chair was placed under the mattress, after I had told him the wound was fatal. When I made my examination, I found that the lower half of his body was paralyzed.” John Clark testified that, “After Dr. Scott had examined the wound, and the chair was placed under the mattress to support him, I was about Foster’s head and attending him. There were others in the room, and some one said something about Foster having had his gun. He raised up, and opening his eyes, looked at me, and said: ‘Yes, I had my gun with me, but I had laid it down.’ ” The defendant objected to this evidence, because it did not lay a sufficient predicate for the introduction of the dying declarations of deceased. Because there was nothing in it to show the state of mind of the deceased or to indicate that he had no hope of recovery, and because the opinion of the physician did not sujjply such proof, which objection was overruled by the court on the ground that sufficient predicate had been laid; . that the jury was then recalled, and the dying declarations were proven before them, as made, without allowing the jury to hear the evidence of the predicate as laid, as the same had been testified to before the court, the court holding that part of the testimony was inadmissible to go to the jury; and to this ruling and action of the court the defendant objected. Because the predicate laid was not sufficient to admit the declarations, and because the defendant had the right to have the jury pass upon the evidence upon which the declarations were admitted, as well as upon the declarations themselves. All of which the court excluded and overruled, and to which exception was duly reserved. Exceptions were reserved to the court’s allowing the State to read, as part of its rebutting evidence, excerpts from the testimony of Peter Barnes—Peter Barnes’ depositions taken at the inquest and examining trials in this case. It was admitted by the court in support of his testimony given as a witness on this trial, which testimony defendant had attempted to impeach by showing contradictory statements made to other parties. A. B. & W. M. Peticolas, for appellant. 1. It was error for the court to allow excerpts from the depositions of Barnes to be read in support of his testimony on the stand. It was, in effect, allowing the witness to corroborate his testimony by himself. The rule allowing an impeached witness to be corroborated, by statements made on other occasions, refers to occasions out of court, and, not in connection with any legal proceedings, and at a time when he is not under the sanction of an oath. Williams v. State, 24 Tex. Crim. App., 637; 9 Tex. Crim. App., 98. 2. The court erred in admitting the dying declarations of Louis Foster. It must satisfactorialy appear in some way, that the declaration was made under a sense of impending death, (2) that it was voluntarily made, (3) that it was not made in answer to questions, or suggestions of a nature calculated to elicit the statement or to draw from the witness* the information given, (4) that the witness was, when the statement was. made, of sound mind. Benavides v. State, 31 Tex. Crim. Rep., 173; Ledbetter v. State, 23 Tex. Crim. App., 256; Hunnicut v. State, 18 Tex. Crim. App., 510; White v. State, 30 Tex. Crim. App., 654; 20 Tex. Crim. App., 638; Miller v. State, 27 Tex. Crim. App., 80; Fulcher v. State, 28 Tex. Crim. App., 467. Foster’s opinion, “Sims ought not to have shot me,” was inadmissible. 9 Tex. Crim. App., 629; 5 Tex. Crim. App., 141; Collins v. Commonwealth, 12 Bush (Ky.), 271. The court erred in refusing to allow the testimony upon which the State relied to establish the predicate for the admission of dying declarations to be heard by the jury. Defendant had the right to have his. whole case upon the facts passed upon by the jury under appropriate charges, and by refusing to allow the jury to pass upon the question as. to whether Foster, at the time he made his alleged dying declarations, made them with a belief that he could not recover, defendant was deprived of a right secured him by the constitution and laws of the land. The court erred in permitting the District Attorney to read the indictment to the jury and the record from Calhoun County showing that the plea of not guilty had been entered in that court for the defendant, and in permitting him thereafter to introduce a part of his rebutting testimony without re-introduction or offering to re-introduce the testimony which had already been heard by the jury before any issue between the State and the defendant had been made up by indictment and plea. When the most of the testimony was heard by the jury there was no issue before them, raised according to law, between the State and the defendant. The crime for which he was being tried, as charged by the State, was, up to the time when the indictment was read, not known to the jury. The reading of the indictment to the jury before the introduction of the evidence as a mandatory requirement of law, and the fact that at a previous term of court in Calhoun County, the indictment had been read to. Sims, and he had been required to plead, and failing to plead, a plea had been entered for him, did not dispense with the necessity of reading the indictment to the jury before the evidence was introduced. Holt v. State, 9 Tex. Crim. App., 571; Cole v. State, 11 Tex. Crim. App., 72; Barbee v. State, 32 Tex. Crim. Rep., 171. The court erred in refusing the charge asked by the defendant, in which the jury were charged not to consider the evidence they had heard before the indictment was read to them in determining the guilt of the defendant in this case. This charge was a correct statement of the law, and was the legal result or consequence of the failure to read the indictment at the proper time, and the failure of the State to re-introduce, or offer to re-introduce the testimony. The verdict was contrary to the charge of the court, and the evidence in this, that the evidence showed that the homicide took place in defense of property, when an attack was being made upon it by\\' the deceased, and in accordance with the charge given, the verdict, if one of guilty at all, should have been for manslaughter and not murder.

App., 274-303. Kearby & Muse and Harris & Knight also for appellant, filed an able brief in the case. A. B. Davidson, District Attorney, and Mann Trice, Assistant Attorney-General, for the State. (1) It is contended that the court erred in permitting the State to read the bill of indictment to the jury and entering a plea of not guilty thereto for the defendant, after the State and defendant had introduced their evidence in chief. In support of this proposition, appellant relies on Arts. 600 and 603, Code Crim. Proc. These articles have been held to be merely directory, and not mandatory. McGrew v. State, 31 Tex. Crim. Rep., 336. The record discloses that appellant had been arraigned, and a plea entered for him in Calhoun County, from which county the venue was changed. This was all that was necessary. See, Bohannon v. State, 14 Tex. Crim. App., 271. The defendant in a felony case can waive everything save and except his right of trial by a jury. In this case each juror, when being examined upon his voir dire, was apprised of the nature and character of the offense for which the defendant was charged, and when the panel was completed, they were sworn a true verdict to render therein on the issues joined between the State and the defendant. While it is a usual practice that after the empaneling of the jury, the indictment should be read, yet if the defendant sits quietly by, without objection, and the testimony is introduced, he would be deemed to have waived the formality of reading the indictment. Aside from this consideration, it is respectfully submitted that the record discloses the introduction of sufficient evidence after the reading of the indictment upon which to predicate the judgment in this case. The dying declaration of the deceased was introduced subsequent to the reading of the indictment, and this, upon its face, is sufficient to predicate the judgment in this case. 2. When we look to the dying declaration, there can be no question but what the proper predicate for its introduction was laid. The deceased was shot in the morning, and died about 1 o’clock p. m.,- the same day. In the course of an hour after he was shot, a physician was called and pronounced his wounds mortal. Ro hope of recovery was expressed or even intimated by the deceased at the time the statements in question were made. Appellant however, contends that the expressions in the dying declarations, (1), “defendant ought not to have shot me,” and (2), “I did not think Sims was going to shoot me,” were but the opinion of the deceased, and should therefore be excluded. This when considered in connection with the expression, “Yes, I had my gun with me, but I had laid it down,” clearly brings the case within the rule that this was but a shorthand rendition of the facts. The testimony of all the eye-witnesses to the homicide shows that the deceased was attempting to erect a fence on land that appellant claimed for EL C. Clark; that he denied his right to erect the fence in the manner sought by the deceased; that the deceased carried a shotgun with him to the place where he was at work, but at the time of the killing the gun was laying some eighteen feet away from the deceased, and the deceased was making no demonstration whatever, showing any intention on his part to inflict death or serious bodily injury upon the defendant. But, on the contrary, when the deceased was shot, he had his head down, was not looking at the defendant, and was trying to remove a staple from one of the posts, and the defendant, sitting on his horse, shot him from above, at a time when the deceased was not even looking toward him. Therefore the expressions “That defendant ought not to have shot me,” and “I did not think Sims was going to shoot me,” must be viewed and construed in the light of the facts attending the homicide, and especially should it be construed in reference to the other expression, “Yes, I had my gun with me, but I had laid it down.” Moreover, the bill of exceptions shows that appellant did not object to the expressions as being the opinions of the deceased, but the only objection made was that no sufficient predicate had been laid for the introduction of the dying declaration. If, however, the court should conclude that the expressions complained of should have been excluded, still there is abundant proof, independent of these expressions, upon which to predicate the judgment in this case.',\n",

Where P., being the equitable owner of sixty- acres of land, of which three-fourths of an acre had been cleared and fenced, left it in charge of a person living on an adjoining tract, who chopped wood upon it and cultivated the clearing, the land being in a densely timbered and sparsely settled country, and the neighbors generally understanding that it belonged to P.: Held, that this was such a possession as constituted notice of P.’s right to one who took a mortgage from the holder of the legal title. 2. In a foreclosure of the mortgage, P. having set up his title, and prayed for a decree that the mortgage be released as against him, and the claim having been litigated, it was not error to grant such relief. Per Dixow, 0. J., dissenting: 1. The possession was vacant, and was insufficient to put the mortgagee upon inquiry. 2. The rule “ that possession, to be notice, must be open, visible, exclusive and unambiguous, not liable to be misunderstood or misconstrued,” requires that it should be thus clearly marked and distinguished as the possession of the pa/tty claiming adversely, and not that of the party having the legal title of record. It must be inconsistent with the possession, and presumed right of possession, which follow the legal title, and which appear to be in the party having such title of record. Ely •o. Wilcox (20 Wis. 523), commented upon, and the facts explained. 3. If the a/pparent possession of land is consistent with the title appearing of record, it is not the duty of the purchaser to make any inquiry concerning the title beyond what the recording office shows. 4. It is only upon the premises themselves, and of persons found there at the time of purchase, that the purchaser is bound to inquire. r Some probable exceptions to this rule noted. 5. Where neighborhood reports or understanding as to an adverse title or claim are admissible in evidence to charge, a mortgagee or purchaser for value with\" notice, it must be shown that he knew them, and the facts, or some of them, with respect to such reputed title or claim. 6.

APPEAL from the Circuit Court for Fond du Lao County. Foreclosure of mortgage of one hundred and sixty acres of land, executed February 7,1854, by one Eliza McCune to the Milwaukee & Horicon Railway Company, and subsequently, before due, negotiated to the plaintiff. In 1849, Jane McCune, owning a warrant for 160 acres of land, requested her brother, John McCune, to enter for her the land here in question; and he did enter it with said warrant, but in his own name. At the same time he entered in his own name an adjoining 160 acre tract, with a warrant belonging to Eliza McCune, who was also his sister, and had requested him to enter said tract for her. In 1851, Jane McCune sold and conveyed the tract in suit to one McWhorter, of whom the defendant LaTce and one S. I). Palmer purchased and took deeds during that and the following year, the-deed to LaTce being for one hundred acres, and that to Palmer for sixty acres, of said tract. In 1852, John McCune undertook to convey to his sisters the tracts which he had purchased for them respectively, as above stated, but by mistake, not discovered by any one until 1858, he conveyed Jane’s tract to Eliza,- and that of the latter to Jane. When Eliza executed the mortgage in suit, she supposed that it covered the land originally entered for her. Lake and Palmer each asked to have the plaintiff adjudged to release the mortgage as against his premises, on the ground that he was the equitable owner in possession at the time the mortgage was made and when it was negotiated to\\' the plaintiff, arid that\" the mortgagee and the plaintiff were chargeable with notice of his rights. That their possession at the time of the assignment to the plaintiff was sufficient, does not seem to h,aVe been disputed; and the only important■ question was,-\\'owh.eth.er there was such a possession as to charge the railroad company when it received the mortgage. The evidence tended to show that Lake went on to the land claimed by him in December, 1851, and cleared up about two and a half acres between that time and March, 1852; that he then left it, and did not return until March, 1855, being out,of the state most of the-time. Lake himself testified: “ When I went off in the spring of 1852, I let the land, by parol, to Mr. Black-wood until I returned. He was to use the three-quarters of an acre that was fenced, and was to clear what I had chopped, and was to have timber off the place ; and he took timber off of it to build a barn. On my return, I found him in possession of the premises ; he had fences-on them, and his cattle pasturing there. More than half the farmers had fences of the same kind. He gave up the possession of the premises to me, and I remained there. * * There was no house on the land when I returned, and no one living there.” It appears that Blackwood owned land immediately adjoining that of Lake, and there was a division\\' fence between them, made of logs. Bláckwood testified: “When I came here in 1849, there was about one-half an acre cleared for cultivation, and one-half an acre chopped, on this land which is claimed by Lake, and there was a fence around the clearing. In 1851, Lake chopped perhaps a couple of acres, cut some logs for a shanty, and split rails for a fence on his land. This clearing came up to the road from Oshkosh to Hortonia. * * Lake left t.bis land in my care when he went away in the spring of 1852. * * I inclosed nearly the whole land with a brush\\'fence, and kept my cattle on it. I kept the fences in repair about the clearing, and raised potatoes on it. I took some firewood and cut some hewing sticks for a barn frame on this land. I had possession until Lake came back in 1855. I cropped the clearing every year, and kept my cattle on the land. * * Previous to 1854 this land was partly inclosed by my fence on one side and the mill pond on the other. * * The country in and around Hortonia was heavily timbered in 1854. It was new, and there was but little clearing on any of the farms. There were only a few acres under cultivation in the-town. This farm of Lateés was used about the same as other farms in that town, except, perhaps, that others had a few more acres cultivated. The indications of actual occupancy and ownership of this land were about the same as on other farms in that town.” Another witness testified: “In 1849 there was a small clearing on this land [claimed by Latte], three-fourths of an acre or more. This clearing was on the only road we had south from here to Oshkosh at that time, and came clear up to the road. Latte chopped adjoining this clearing and in sight of the road. * * When Blackwood was in possession of the land, there was a log fence built between him and Latte ; there was also a fence around the clearing on the place. . The fence built by Blackwood, and the mill pond, inclosed nearly all of LaJtés land; so that, after the fence was built, Blackwood used nearly the whole of the tract for a pasture.” Another witness testified that he came to said town of Hortonia in October, 1853, and first became acquainted with the tract claimed by Latte, he thought, in February, 1854. “ Blackwood then came to me» and said that tract of land was left in his care by Latte, and that if I would help him fence it we would occupy it together as pasture land. We fenced it the latter part of February and the fore part of March, perhaps, 1854. We made a tree fence, so that, with Blackwood’s fence and the mill pond, it was nearly all inclosed. * * The next summer we used the whole land for pasture.” Several other witnesses testified to substantially the same facts. As to the notoriety of Lake’s claim of ownership, etc., one witness testified: “ It was generally known here in 1852 that Lake owned tlie land. There were but few inhabitants here then, and I think they all knew that the land was Lake\\'s, because it was called Lake\\'s land.” Another said: “In the winter of 1851-2 Lake claimed to have bought the land and to be the owner of it. Ever since that winter or the following spring, the land has been in the actual occupancy of Lake or somebody.” Another said: “It was generally known and understood around here that Lake had purchased and owned the land ; from the winter of 1852 it went by the- name of Lake\\'s land.” Several others testified in the same manner. In reference to the occupancy of the sixty acres claimed by Palmer, the evidence was that a small tract, three-fourths of an acre or an acre, adjoining the public road, was cleared before 1851, and surrounded with a pole fence, and that one Thompson who lived on an adjoining tract, had charge of this land in 1853 and 1854, either as the agent or tenant of Silas Palmer. Thompson testifies: “ I occupied the clearing on the Palmer tract during the season of 1853. * * Silas and Edward Palmer were at my hotise I should think in December, 1853. My son Henry went out hunting with them, and when he returned told me that Palmer wanted me to take charge of that tract and not let the timber be stolen ; I then went on and cut some wood off of it. Kelsey came on in the spring, and I let him have the clearing to plant beans on. I worked with him on the place. I kept watch of the land until it was sold. We got wood off of it, and kept the pine timber from being stolen. It remained in my charge until 1855. * * I cultivated the clearing for two or three years, commencing with 1853. I had beans on it for the summer of 1853. * * No one lived on the land in 1854.” Henry Thompson, son of the previous witness, testified to the same facts. The testimony of Mr. Kelsey, above mentioned, show that his occupancy of the clearing did not commence until several months after tlie date of the mortgage in suit. Silas D. Palmer testified that in the spring of 1852 he rented the premises to Thompson, who was already “in possession” of them; and that from that time until witness sold the. premises to Edward E. Palmer, in 1857, Thompson was “in the actual and continued possession” of them as his tenant. Edrnard F. Palmer also testified that in 1852 or 1858 he was present at an interview between Ms brother Silas and Thompson, at which the land was rented to the latter. There was also testimony, similar to that above recited in reference to the Lake tract, to show that in 1852 and thereafter it was generally understood in the neighborhood that this land belonged to Silas D. Palmer. The court found that, when the mortgage in suit was made, the defendant Lake and the grantor of the defendant Palmer were “in the open, visible, exclusive and unambiguous possession ” of the tracts claimed by them respectively, and rendered judgment that the mortgage be released as against them; and the plaintiff appealed. Hudd & Wigman, for appellant, contended, 1. That a title hostile to that of the mortgagor could not be adjudicated, though litigated, in this action. The judgment should have been so framed, perhaps, as to protect the respondents from a writ of restitution in this action, dismissing it as to them ; but it could not give affirmative relief.

Appeal from Mobile Circuit Court. Heard before Hon. Samuel B. Browne. Assumpsit by William A. Holt and others, by next friend, against Hermann & Hynde. From a judgment for defendants, plaintiffs appeal. Affirmed. The will after devising certain property to two daughters and a son, contains the following: Item 7: “I give and devise and bequeath unto my grandson William A. Holt the house and lot on the southeast corner of Lawrence and Eslava, streets in the city of Mobile.” Item 8: “I give and bequeath and devise unto my grandson Eugene Holt the house and lot on the south side of Eslava street, second east of Lawrence street, in the city of Mobile. “All the rest and residue of my property, of every kind and description, I give, devise and bequeath unto my five children and • two grandchildren, taking their mother’s share, share and share alike.” The will was dated February 13, 1903. The plaintiffs in the case were the beneficiaries named in items 7 and 8, and it was agreed that all the beneficiaries named in the will are living, and that at the date of the will the testatrix was in the actual possession of a lot of land in the southwest corner of Elmira and Lawrence streets, and that subsequent to a purchase the said testatrix had built thereon Wo houses facing Elmira street, and extending back parallel, or nearly so,' with Lawrence street, and that she had erected upon the south line of said lot a shed for housing fuel, and also certain closets. It is further agreed that subsequent to the making of said last will and testament, and during her life, testatrix erected upon the southern portion of said lots another house, and in order to do this it was necessary to have said shed and closets torn down and moved. She also had erected a fence as shown by the map. It is further agreed that this condition of three separate houses and three separate tenants of three separate portions of one lot, divided from each other by partition fences on all sides where they join, continued to exist at the time of the death of said testatrix, and still continues to exist. It is agreed further that defendants-were the agents of said testatrix during her life for the renting of said property, and have continued to he the-agents • for renting of the property since her death. It is further agreed that, by the tacit consent of all the-heirs, legatees, and devisees of testatrix, defendants collected the rents from the three houses for the benefit of such said heirs, devisees, and legatees as might be justly entitled thereto, and that since the decision in the case of Holt v. McEvoy, 52 South. 328, on the 21st day of April, 1910, by the Supreme Court of Alabama, said defendants have continued to rent said property, as the-agents of James McEvoy and Elisabeth McEvoy; said. James J. being the owner of the house nearest the corner of Lawrence and Elmira streets, and the said Elizabeth being the owner of the house situated upon the-south side of Elmira street next west of James J. Mc-Evoy’s house, and the said Elisabeth and James together claiming the house situated upon the rear of said lot. By item 1 of the will, in addition to other property,. Elizabeth McEvoy is given the house and lot now inclosed by fences on the northeast corner of Lawrence and Madison streets, and also the house and lot on the south side of Elmira street, second west of Lawrence street. By item 6 of the will James J. McEvoy is given, the house and lot on the southwest corner of Elmira and Lawrence streets in the city of Mobile. The action is to collect from the agents the rent of the three houses-last above mentioned. Frederick; G-. Bromberg, for appellant. The will speaks only from the death of the testator. — Sec. 6155-6,. Code 1907; Blaheney v. DuBose, 167 Ala. 627; L. R. 1 Chancery. The case of Holt v. McEvoy, 166 Ala. 358, is without application to- the case at bar. Counsel discusses the different items of the will and insists that the three lots in question passed «under the general residuary clause and not under the two lots specifically devised. — Bcmhs v.

APPEAL from the Circuit Court for Hacine County. Trespass quare clausum. Answer, highway. Plaintiff, in 1861, and until 1864, occupied or claimed to occupy as tenant of one Richards, a triangular tract of land, containing about two acres, bounded on the north by a town line separating it from plaintiff’s farm, on the west by the Fox river, and on the south by a strip of land taken by the Racine & Mississippi R. R. Company for its road-bed, running in a north-easterly direction from tbe river to said town line, and tbenee to the “Kenosha road,” which lay east of plaintiff’s farm. Defendant owned a quarter acre tract, bounded on the west by said river, and surrounded on all other sides by plaintiff’s farm, except that its southern point touched Richards’ two acre lot. From this quarter acre tract a dam extended across the river, and at its opposite end was a flouring mill owned by defendant. In 1861, defendant built a bridge across the river just above the dam, and abutting at its eastern end on said quarter acre tract. In April of either 1861 or 1862, plaintiff, at defendant’s request, and with materials partly furnished by him, built a fence from the north side of said bridge in a south-easterly direction to the land of the railroad company, mainly across said land of Richards, and consented to defendant’s using for a road the land along said fence on its south-easterly side; and defendant thereupon opened and worked such road. In February, 1864, plaintiff purchased of Richards the whole tract first above described, and took a deed thereof. In April of that year he took down the fence above mentioned, and built his fences so as to enclose the aforesaid road, and forbade defendant to cross his land from the bridge to the railroad; and in December following defendant committed the alleged trespass in removing a part of the fences so built, and passing over said roadway. Plaintiff’s evidence tended to show that it was in April, 1862, and after defendant’s bridge was nearly completed, that he (plaintiff) consented to build and did build the fence first above mentioned, and gave his consent to defendant’s using said road; that he said at that time to defendant, “ I will stand between you and trespass until you can write to Richards, and either buy or lease ” said two acres; and that plaintiff thereupon wrote to Richards (who resided in New York), under date April 14, 1862. This letter, which Richards testified was the first be ever received fiomtbe defendant relating to tbat subject, was put in evidence, and was as follows: “ Dear Sir: There is a small piece of your land lying north of the railroad, amounting to about two acres. I have been building a bridge across the river on the dam, and wish to purchase from you the above, for. the purpose of getting a road through to the Kenosha road. Your two acres do not extend to the Kenosha road, but I can get the remainder from the railroad company, but cannot get to the railroad without crossing your land; therefore I would like to purchase,” &c. Richards answered this letter. In January and August, 1863, defendant made further applications to him to purchase said lands, but received no answer. As to the character of the answer to the letter of April 14, 1862, Richards testifies as follows: “I refused to sell him, giving my reasons, but informed him I was favorably disposed for him to have a road, and stated that I would call and see him when I next came to Wisconsin. I did call at his mill, but did not see him.” He further testifies: “ The only negotiation that I had in any way with defendant was in answering this letter; and as to conversations with him, I never knew him until after I sold the land to Bushnell. * * My intentions were that defendant should have a,road across the premises; when Bushnell applied for the land, I forgot to state to him that I had given Scott encouragement that he should have a road. After drawing the deed to Bushnell, I had intended to retain it until arrangements were made between Scott and Bushnell about the road. I sent the deed to my agent Perkins, requesting him to see Bushnell and Scott, as I was favorably disposed that Scott should have a road.” The defendant’s evidence tended to show that it was in April, 1861, and before the bridge was built, that plaintiff built said fence from the river to the railroad, and consented to defendant’s opening the road. Defendant himself testified that he wrote to Richards in February, 1861, stating that he was. about to build a bridge, if be could get an outlet to the Keno-sha road ; that he received a reply about the last of March or first of April of the same year, which he had lost; that the substance of the reply was, that Richards would not sell the land, but defendant could have the use of it for a road; that defendant showed the letter to plaintiff, who thereupon agreed to build and did build the fence from the \\'bridge to the railroad, and consented to his using the road as above stated. “ During the summer of 1861, I built the bridge; should not have built it but for this road; it cost me $550 to $600. I also worked the road the same season ; put in a culvert, and hauled on dirt, at a cost of $25 or $30.” The court refused the following instructions asked by the defendant: 1. “ If the defendant and the public were in possession of the premises, claiming them adversely to the plaintiff and his grantor as a road, at the time plaintiff obtained his deed from Richards, the deed was void to that extent, and conferred upon plaintiff no right to close up the road.” 2. The acts and conduct of plaintiff, as well as of his grantor, may be taken into consideration in determining whether the premises had been dedicated by them or either of them to the use of a road.” 8. “ If defendant was induced to build the bridge or make the road in consequence of the acts and conduct of the plaintiff and his grantor, then plaintiff was estopped from setting up a right to obstruct the road.” The following instructions were given: “ 1. Dedication is the deliberate appropriation of land by its owner for any general and public use, reserving to himself no other rights in the soil than such as are perfectly compatible with the full exercise and enjoyment of the public use to which he has devoted his property. 2. An intention on the part of the owner to dedicate must be shown, as well as an actual appropriation of the property by the public, for the use to\\'which it is dedicated. 3. The acts of plaintiff in building the fence and permitting the road to be opened and worked, were binding upon Richards only so far as he bad authority from Richards to do those acts; and it is entirely immaterial whether the plaintiff upon his own behalf did acts of dedication of the premises in question, before he became owner of the same. 4. If Richards promised defendant the road for public use in consideration that defendant would bridge the river and build the road; and defendant did so; and -the road was opened and used by the public as a highway, for a considerable time; these facts would go far to prove a dedication by Richards. 5. The fact that the road was opened and in public use as a highway, when plaintiff received a conveyance of the premises, is constructive notice to the plaintiff of the rights of the public thereto, whatever those rights may be, and he is in the position that Richards would be in, had be retained the title to the land. 6. If there was therefore a valid dedication by Richards of this land for public use, then the fences placed there by plaintiff were public nuisances, and the- defendant or any other citizen had a right to remove them, if the removal was effected without any breach of the peace.” A verdict for the plaintiff was set aside, and a new trial granted: “ the court being of opinion that it had erred in charging the jury that it was entirely immaterial whether plaintiff did acts of dedication of the premises before he became owner of the same.” From this order plaintiff appealed.

The deed from Richards to plaintiff of land in the possession either of the public as a public highway, or of the defendant \\'as a private road, was so far void. R.

Plaintiff, while in possession of the premises, acting for himself and in behalf of Richards, fenced out the road or highway, and put defendant in possession; and Richards afterwards, by his acts, acquiescence and expressed intentions, adopted plaintiff’s acts ; and both are therefore es-topped from setting up an exclusive right to the premises, and from obstructing the use of the road or highway, and certainly from maintaining this action. 12 Petersdorff’s Ab., 178, Case 4; Winter v.

       "  'case_summary': \"Henry B. Hedgepeth and Others v. Felix W. Robertson. Where the highway is impassable, or it is necessary in order to extricate a wagon and team from a bog in the highway, it is lawful to lay down a fence by tire side of the highway, and pass through the field ; this may be done by a slave, in his master’s service, the master being responsible for the proper exercise of the right. There can be nothing clearer or better settled, than that it is proper for the Court to charge the jury directly upon the legal effect of the admitted or uncontroverted facts of the case. Where a slave is lost to his master by the wrongful act of another, it matters not whether he came to his death in one way or another, or whether he is dead or alivé, the master is entitled to recover his value. Where the defendants had proved that the plaintiff, before bringing the suit, had expressed an opinion, formed from circumstances then within his knowledge, as to the existence of a fact, afterwards in issue in the suit, it was held that it would not have been proper for the Court to charge the jury, “ that the admissions of the plaintiff should be received by them as good evidence for the defendants.” In cases of wrongful trespass, resulting in the loss of the plaintiff’s slave and' other damage, the jury may allow exemplary damages. Appeal from Austin. Tried below before the Hon. James H. Bell. Suit by Felix W. Robertson against H. B. Hedgepeth, Jared E. Kirby and Joseph H. White, to’ recover damages, commenced March 2nd, 1853. Pleas of not guilty. Evidence of plaintiff, depositions of A. W. and R. L. Hood, as follows: 1 The plaintiff's slave, named John, on or about the 17th of April, 1853, was driving the plaintiff’s team of five yoke of oxen and wagon, laden with six bales of cotton, the property of the plaintiff, on the road from Washington to Houston. It was immediately after an overflow of the Brazos river ; and during the night, in the Brazos bottom, on the east side, John got into a bog with his wagon and team, on the public road, where it ran by the side of, and parallel with the fencing of the defendant Kirby ; and John, finding it impossible otherwise to extricate his team and wagon from the bog, there being a large pile of logs on the opposite side of the road, pulled down a portion of the .fence, stating that he did not believe Kirby would care. After failing to get his wagon out, John said he would put up the fencing again ; but by this time it was too dark to put up the fence well, and John encamped there. Early next morning, defendant Hedgepeth, Kirby's overseer, coming along, and seeing the fencing pulled down, made a great fuss about it, and attempted to chastise John. Witness told Hedgepeth that the pulling down of the fence was done innocently ; that it should be put up, and that it was a small thing to make a fuss about. In the meantime John ran off a little piece, and stopped for a few moments. As he ran off, Hedgepeth said, You may go, God d—n you ; but I will kill you or whip you before you get home. Hedgepeth then jumped off his horse, put a negro boy on him, and commanded him to go immediately after his double barrel gun and dogs. The negro boy obeyed, and returned in about fifteen minutes with the other two defendants, Kirby and White. Kirby as he rode up, asked Hedgepeth what was the the difficulty. Hedgepeth informed him what, had taken place. Kirby then asked who the boy John belonged to. Hedgepeth then asked Kirby what he should do. Kirby told him to pursue the boy John, handing him, Hedgepeth, his gun, and telling him to stop the boy, and not to let him go home. Hedgepeth and White, with the gun and dogs, immediately followed after John, who had fled back towards the river ; after which witness, A. W. Hood, soon heard guns firing and dogs running in the direction they went. In an hour afterwards Hedgepeth returned and said he had seen nothing of John. John was never heard of afterwards. He was an expert swimmer. Wit ness turned the team loose in the range ; the cotton was left, three bales on the wagon, and three thrown off in the bog by the wagon. John was an unusually valuable boy ; between twenty-five and thirty years of age; worth from twelve to thirteen hundred dollars; services worth $180 per year. A witness for plaintiff testified that the damage done to the cotton, the team and the wagon, and the trouble and expense of collecting the team, would amount to about one hundred and fifty dollars. The fence of Kirby’s field was being repaired, and was still unfenced a few hundred yards on the road in the direction of Houston, beyond where John took down the fence. At the place where John pulled down the fence, the road that had been travelled a few days before was on the inside of the new fence, and there was no cotton growing on it. John fastened his oxen by a log chain to a stump on the side of the road next the fence, so that few, if any of the oxen could, in swinging around,, reach across the road, (where it had been a few days before) to where the cotton was growing. The cotton was just coming up ; but a few stalks were touched or injured by the cattle. The defendants’ evidence was as follows : The defendants had not cross-examined the plaintiff’s witnesses, and the depositions of the same witnesses, taken by the defendants, were as follows: Witness, (A. W. Hood,) Robert L. Hood, and the negro in question, crossed the Brazos river at Baldridge's Ferry about the 15th or 20th of April, A. D., 1852. The negro boy started from the river, after we had crossed, ahead, and shortly after-wards I started and found him about one-third of the way out of the bottom, with his,, wagon upset. After aiding him to reload, it being then nearly dark, we started on again, the negro ahead as before, and when we were about half way up . Kirby’s fence, outside of the field, I overtook him again, bogged down ; about the time I stopped my wagon the negro com menced pulling down the fence ; I told him not to pull down the fence, for we could not get out of the bottom that night; and that we had better tie up our oxen until morning, when I thought we could easily get along outside the fence, but he replied that he be d—d if he did’nt know Ool. Kirby, and Kirby knew him, and that he would pull down the fence and go out of the bottom that night; after pulling down the fence he made several attempts to make his oxen pull the wagon into the field, but, failing to do so, he finally concluded to camp. I tied up my oxen on the outside of the fence and built my fire on the opposite side of the road from the fence ; the negro, however, carried his oxen on-the inside of the fence and, leaving them all chained together, fastened them to a stump in the field, and then built his fire on the inside of the field, about twenty yards from where I was camped, and remained in the field with his oxen, about five yoke, and his horse, until morning. As soon as it became light I saw Kirby’s hands at work, up ahead of us, some quarter of a mile, and I told the boy he had better go up where they were and get help, as I myself was unable to assist him, and also told him, if the overseer was there, he had better tell him what he had done. He went off and was gone but a short time when he returned with two stout negro men. As soon as he returned I told him to throw off some of the cotton, and I think they had about three bags off the wagon, when Hedgepeth, one of the defendants, rode up to me and asked me by what authority I pulled down his fence. I replied that I had not done so. He then turned his horse and asked the boy John if he had pulled down the fence, who replied that he had. Hedgepeth asked me then if John was under my charge. I told him that he was not, only so far as to see that the wagon and team were taken care of. Hedgepeth then said to John, “ I’ll whip you, God d—n you.” Upon this Hedgepeth started to ride up to John, but he went round on the opposite side of the oxen. Hedgpeth then said to the boy, “ pull of your coat, I mean what I say, sir,” to which John replied, “ I spects you does sir.” Upon this Hedgepeth spurred his horse around on the same side of the oxen with John, but John ran out of the field by the wagon; as he passed the two negroes, who were aiding him to unload, Hedgepeth called to them to catch him, and one of them made a pass at him, but John told him not to lay his hands on him ; John then ran about thirty yards down the road towards the ferry and stopped. As he was going off, however, Hedgepeth called out to him, “ you can run, God d—n you, but I’ll whip you or kill you before you get home, you d—d son of a b—h.” With that Hedgepeth leaped from his horse, and told one of the negroes above referred to, to go to Col. Kirby’s after his gun and dog ; but at that time he did not follow John out of the field. I then observed to Mr. Hedgpeth that may-be we had better fix the matter up without any difficulty ; but he did not reply ; upon which I turned and went to John, who was still standing in the road, about thirty yards off, and when I got up to him, asked-him if he intended to leave ; he said that he did, and I then told him that he had better come back, for Col. Kirby would come down, and if they whipped him at all, they should not whip him much ; but he refused to do so, and halloed to my nephew to bring him his horse, blit Hedgepeth took hold of the horse about the same time with my nephew and said that he would take care of the horse ; about this time John ran off towards the river. About an half hour after this Col. Kirby and White, and another young man whom I did not know came down where we were. Kirby, when he rode up, asked what the difficulty was; but I heard no one reply. Kirby then asked me whose wagon it was, (referring to John's wagon.) I replied that it was Capt. Felix Robertson’s of Independence; Kirby then said that Robertson was an old friend of his, and that he disliked to see his wagon left in that fix. Hedgepeth then said that he would overtake the boy and bring him back, but after getting about twenty yards off he turned around and said, “ Col. Kirby if you will give me your gun I’ll make the d-/-d rascal comeback Kirby handed him his gun and he went off towards the ferry. Hedgepeth was absent about a half an hour and returned without John ; and as he rode up I asked him if he had seen the boy, he replied that he had not, but that John had been to the ferry, and the ferryman refused to put him across the river, and that he did not know what had become of him. After this Kirby assisted me out of the bottom with my wagon, and intended also to aid me in getting Robertson’s out, but I was taken sick after I got mine out, and could not assist him. The field was a cotton field, and the cotton was just getting up to be a good stand. The oxen were tied to a stump in the field and trampled down the cotton around the stump the full length of the team ; they also trampled down cotton in coming into the .field, and during the next morning they were turned loose and tramped down considerable cotton. The defendants Kirby and White did not see or speak to the boy, Hedgepeth being the only one of them present. I can recollect nothing more in relation to the matter, except that, while Hedgepeth was gone, as before stated, I heard a gun fire in the direction of the ferry, but don’t know who fired it. Witness R. L. Hood, testified to same, except that he did not recollect hearing a gun fire. Deposition of William J. White, as follows : I do not recollect the month, but I recollect that in the Spring of 1852,1 was in Col. Jared E. Kirby’s yard with him, when one of Col. Kirby’s negroes rode up, riding the overseer’s (Mr. Hedgepeth’s) horse, and stated that Mr. Hedgepeth was down in the bottom in a difficulty with some wagoners, and that he wanted Col. Kirby’s gun. Col. Kirby mounted his horse and went down himself; Joseph H. White went also, and as there was no other horse ready, I went upon the horse which the negro rode. When we got down there we found Mr. Hedgepeth, who stated that a negro boy with a wagon and team had camped there the previous evening, and turned his oxen into the field upon the young cotton, after taking down the fence ; that the boy had. camped in the field. I examined the field in company with Col. Kirby, Mr. Hedgpeth, Mr. J. H. White and Mr. Hood, (who was in company with the negro boy with another wagon and team,) being all the parties present, and found the fence downf some of the oxen belonging to the negro boy’s team in the field. Mr. Hedgepeth stated that he had threatened to whip the boy, when the boy run off. The first question Col. Kirby asked Mr. Hedgepeth was, whom the boy belonged to, to which Mr. Hedgepeth replied that he belonged to Capt. Robertson. “ Is it Capt. Felix Robertson, of Independence ?” asked Col. Kirby ; to which Mr. Hood replied yes ; when Col, Kirby remarked that Capt. Robertson was a friend of his, and he hated to see his wagon in such a fix, the wagon being bogged down and part of the load thrown off. Then Mr. Hedgepeth remarked that he could go and overtake the boy and bring him back before he got to the river, and Col. Kirby said he would be very glad if he would do so. Mr. Hedgepeth started to go, but turned round to Col. Kirby and said, “ hand me your gun, for, if he sees me, he will be sure to run from me.” Col. Kirby handed Mr. Hedgepeth the gun, which was loaded ; then Joseph H. White asked Col. Kirby to allow him to go, and Col. Kirby said he might do so. Then I asked Col. Kirby if I might go, and he told me I could not as I had no horse to ride, (having rode Mr. Hedgepeth’s horse down to the bottom, behind the negro.) Mr. Hedgepeth and Joseph H. White then rode off together. They were gone probably half an hour, when they returned ; when they came back they stated they had not seen the negro ; that the ferryman at Rock Island ferry told them the boy had been there a few minutes before. We all then returned to Col. Kirby’s house together, and I found the gun still loaded, and believe that the gun had not been fired off during their ab sence, and neither of them, to my knowledge or belief, had any powder or lead with them, to reload, in case of necessity. What I have here stated occurred in Austin county. The defendant then introduced Thomas J. Wells, who testified that he heard the plaintiff, Eobertson, say, about one or two days after the occurrence, in a conversation with Mr. Howth, that he, Eobertson, had trailed the negro John from where said negro left the road at the ferry, down the river for half a mile, or more, and that there were no signs of any persons pursuing said slave from the road, and that he did not believe that any one had shot the negro. The Judge instructed the jury, without request, as follows : That, if they believe from the evidence that the boy John pulled down the fence of defendant Kirby, only for the purpose of extricating his wagon and team from the bog, and that no real damage was done to Kirby by the act, it was a trespass without injury, for which, at most, nominal damages could have been recovered, and for which neither Kirby nor his overseer had. a right to inflict personal chastisement upon the slave. If, on the other hand, the jury believe from the evidence, that there was no necessity for pulling down the fence, or that any unavoidable injury was done to Kirby’s property, in that case the defendant Kirby, or his overseer, would have the right to inflict moderate and reasonable personal chastisement upon the slave. If the jury believe from the evidence, that Kirby consented to the pursuit of the slave John by White and Hedgepeth, or encouraged such pursuit to be made by White and Hedgepeth, with force and arms, such consent made Kirby a co-trespasser with White and Hedgepeth. Under the circumstances of this case the pursuit of the slave John, with dogs and arms, was a wrongful act and a trespass in contemplation of law, and the owner of the slave is entitled to recover from the defendants such losses as are the natural results of the wrongful acts of defendants. The mere absence of the slave, without having been heard from since the Spring of 1852, is not sufficient, of itself, to raise a presumption of his death, but it is competent for the jury to infer his death from the circumstances of the pursuit. The jury cannot give damages for the value of the negro and for his hire too down to this time ; but any loss of property which resulted naturally and directly from the wrongful acts of defendants, and any expenses incurred in the protection of the cotton or team, necessarily incurred by plaintiff in consequence of the wrongful act of defendants, are proper to be considered in your estimate of the damages. The jury must judge of the evidence for themselves. The defendants excepted to the instructions so given, and requested the Court to give the following instructions, which were refused: 1st. If a person in repelling the trespass of a slave, should frighten the slave, so that the slave should run off and be lost to his master, the person, so repelling the trespass, will not be liable to the owner of the slave for the hire or value of the slave. 2d. A person cannot recover damages, unless he proves that he has sustained damages, and unless he proves the amount of the damages which he has sustained. 3d. The plaintiff cannot recover the value of the negro John, unless he has proved that the negro came to his death by the wrongful act of the defendants, or some one or more of them. 4th. The jury cannot presume the death of the negro from the mere proof of his not having been heard from since April, A. D., 1852. 5th. The plaintiff cannot recover the value of the oxen and wagon and cotton, unless he has proved the total loss of said property to him by the wrongful act of some one or more of the defendants. 6th. The plaintiff cannot recover the damages sustained to the cotton, wagon and team unless they have proved the amount of damages so sustained. 7th. The employee is not responsible for a trespass committed by his overseer, unless the same is done by his command and consent. 8th. If you believe that the defendants are not in fault, that they have not committed the trespass complained of, you will find for the defendants. 9th. The declarations of the defendant, Hedgepeth, as Introduced by plaintiff, are good evidence both for and against the defendants. 10th. The admissions of the plaintiff, Robertson, should be received by the jury as evidence for the defendants. Verdict and judgment for the plaintiff for $1300. Motion for new trial overruled, &c. Ballinger & Jack, for appellant Kirby. I. The ground of complaint of the defendant Kirby is that he was not allowed the right of trial by jury in this case in the sense in which that right is guaranteed to every citizen of the State. The charge of the Judge was “ under the circumstances of “ this case, the pursuit of the slave John with arms and dogs “ was a wrongful act, and a trespass in contemplation of law “ and the owner is entitled to recover from the defendants such “ losses as are the natural result of the wrongful acts of de- “ fendants.” This determines the whole case. It settles the character and circumstances of the pursuit, and pronounces that pursuit the trespass, for which all the defendants were to be held liable for the value of the slave. The jury were allowed no liberty but to assess damages. The facts of this case will not tolerate a peremptory charge, in effect, to the jury that Col. Kirby should be held responsible for the value of the slave. 1st. It is clear that the negro committed a trespass in pulling down the fence, and turning his oxen in all night on the young cotton. 2d. The owner had a right properly to chastise him therefor. There was no civil remedy against his master. (McManus v. Crickett, 1 East. 106; Lyons v. Martin, 8 Ad. & El. 512; Timothy v. Simpson, 6 C. & P. 499; Snee v. Trice, 2 Bay’s R. 343.) Even if there was a civil remedy against the master, there are “ other salutary checks,” in the language of the case in 2 Bay, which are more efficacious—that is, the proper punishment of the slave. It would be perfectly absurd to say, that slaves could be sent from the interior parts of the State to Houston, to camp out along the road, and that for such trespasses as they are liable to commit, there should be no preventive or correction, but a suit against the master, or taking the slave before s civil magistrate. 3d. The overseer attempted to punish the slave, and the latter ran off towards the ferry. If the overseer had a right to punish him, so far, no wrong was done. If he had not, it was a wrong in which Kirby did not participate, of which he was ignorant, and for which he is not responsible. The negro was never afterwards seen. Robertson proves the statements of Hedgepeth and White that they had not seen the negro. Robertson himself said he had tracked the negro down the river, and was satisfied he had not been overtaken. Now what caused the loss of the negro ? Was it his running away to avoid the whipping ? Did he attempt, as he said he would, when he left, to go home to his master ? Did he try to swim the river and was drowned ? Did he run away, and has not since been heard from ? Or, when subsequently pursued, was he overtaken and murdered, or devoured by the dogs, or run into the river and drowned ? Who shall decide that question ? Is it undisputed and clear from the record ? We affirm, without hesitation, that no man can read the record and say candidly that the latter hypothesis is undisputed. Nor do we believe it at all probable. If the loss of the negro resulted from his leaving to avoid the whipping, there can be no pretense of liability on the part of Kirby, and that question should have been left to the jury. 4th. Kirby came up, expressed his regret at what had occurred, spoke of Robertson as his friend, and put his own negroes to work to rescue Robertson’s cotton and team from their condition. The overseer proposed to bring back the negro, and asked for Kirby’s gun, and Kirby’s brother-in-law went along. Riding off they were followed by the dogs which were around. Said his Honor below, this pursuit was a trespass. Did not that depend on its design, or at least on its results. The object clearly was to bring back the negro—the gun was taken, not to shoot him down ; but to control him, and make him stop. But it is useless to discuss the design. The negro must have been overtaken and injured, or his injury must have resulted from the pursuit, in order that the pursuit should have been a trespass. He may have been pursued with the spirit of fiends and with the force of an army : but unless they found him, and thereby forced the negro to do something to his injury, it was no trespass. What caused the loss of the negro was the practical necessary question for a jury to decide. To assume that this is clear and undisputed from the record and that there was any blameable connection therewith on the part of Col. Kirby is, we think, to do extreme violence to the testimony, and cause great injustice. It has been settled against him, not by the verdict of the jury, but by the fiat of the Judge. -F.

Practice. — Motion to Strike Out. — Overruling a motion to strike out part of a complaint is not available error on appeal.

Sam:e. — Instructions.—Waiver.—Objections to instructions not argued in the brief, nor supported by authority, are waived. Same. — Pound Ordinance. — Police Regulation. — Harmless Inaccuracy. — A pound ordinance is a police regulation authorizing summary proceedings, and must be strictly adhered to; but a statement in an instruction that it is “penal in its nature,” is but a slight inaccuracy, could do no harm, and ought to be disregarded. Evidence. — Conversion.—Where there was no proof of a wrongful appropriation, or of intent to make a wrongful appropriation, of an animal impounded by a city marshal under a city ordinance, a finding against the city, upon a paragraph of complaint charging such a conversion by the city, is not sustained by the evidence. Same. — Negligence.—A paragraph of complaint charging a city with negligence in four particulars: 1st, building the pound fence too low; 2d, tying the animal of plaintiff with a rope too long; 3d, failing to post up notice of impounding; and 4th, failing to offer the animal for sale at the end of forty-eight hours after the posting, is not sustained by sufficient evidence, where no witness testified that the fence was too low, or that the animal was improperly tied, or that the failure to post notices or to sell produced the injury complained of, or had any tendency to produce it. Same. — A city is not shown to have been guilty of the negligence which was the proximate cause of an injury to an animal confined in a pound, when it appears that the animal ruined itself by a wild and vicious effort to overleap a fence sufficient to confine any ordinary animal of the horse kind. Same. — PoundFence.—When a pound fence intended to confine horses and cattle is proved to be sufficient for its purpose by competent and credible witnesses, and no testimony is introduced to the contrary, such proof settles the question as to the sufficiency of the fence, and the mere fact that an animal confined in such pound, and properly cared for there, kills itself by rushing against such fence, or by kicking against it, or by trying to clear it in leaping, does not impair the testimony of those witnesses, and has no tendency to prove the’insufficiency of the fence.

       "  'case_summary': \"Lehigh Valley Railroad Company, Appellant, v. Frank. Railroads — Real estate — Adverse possession — Title. 1. Title to land purchased by a railroad company for railroad purposes, adjoining its right of wa3q but not actuary occupied by its tracks, may be acquired by twenty-one years’ adverse possession; and it is immaterial that the company may have intended to lay tracks on such land, if in fact such intention was never carried into practical effect. 2. The purchaser from a trespasser may tack the latter's adverse possession to his own so as to give title by the statute of limitations. Argued March 2, 1909. Appeal, No. 29, March T., 1909, by plaintiff, from judgment of C. P. Luzerne Co., May T., 1906, No. 18, on verdict for plaintiff in case of The Lehigh Valley Railroad Company v. William Frank. Before Rice, P. J., Porter, Henderson, Morrison, Head and Beaver, JJ. Affirmed. Ejectment for land in the city -of Wilkes-Barre. Before Fuller, J. The facts are stated in the opinion of the Superior Court. The court charged in part as follows: [I repeat, if you find from this testimony that there was such a fence alongside of that property, with a house built as described, dating from a period before 1882, and continuing down to the inception of this suit, then you would be warranted in finding that the defendant had acquired title to that strip, by adverse possession, even although no portion of it was included in his paper title; unless — now we come to another question — -prevented by another consideration, to which I will now call your attention, and I only call it to your attention for the purpose of instructing you to disregard it, because as I view it, it will have no bearing upon your duties. I mention it because it is an important question of law which has been presented here, and upon which it is my duty to instruct you. The plaintiff contends that even if defendant’s adverse possession had been such as to give defendant title against the ordinary individual, it is nevertheless unavailing against a railroad corporation, as to land acquired by it for its railroad. It is correct to say, as an abstract proposition of law, that when land is acquired by a railroad corporation, either by purchase- or by condemnation, and is actually used for its railroad, no title can be gained to any portion of what is thus used, by adverse possession, however long it may be continued. That is a correct legal proposition in the abstract. But I do not believe that the proposition is applicable to the facts in evidence here. What are those facts? Why, simply first, a deed to the railroad corporation in 1870 for a certain lot of land, with nothing in the deed to denote the intended use of the land; next, a railroad, two main tracks and a switch built across a portion of the lot (I do not recall, however, any evidence in the case showing when these railroad tracks were built on the lot); next, the remainder of the lot, including the land in dispute, apparently severed in use from the railroad by a well-defined line, fenced above and below, and fenced for more than twenty years, at least, along the line of the portion in dispute and the portion disclaimed; next, the portion in dispute not only separated thus, but separated by a side fence, and built upon, and in the actual occupancy of the defendant and his predecessors; next, a corporate intention, if that has been established by competent evidence, some time, in some way, to use the land for railroad tracks. That is the sum total of the evidence on that proposition, and I say to you as a matter of law the railroad has not established its immunity from adverse possession under the legal principle which it invokes. I may be wrong about that, and if I am the error will be easily subject to correction.] [I] Verdict and judgment for defendant. Plaintiff appealed. Error assigned was above instruction, quoting it. J. B. Woodward, of Wheaton, Darling & Woodward, for appellant. — A railroad is a public highway, and the land which it covers whether acquired by the exercise of eminent domain or by purchase is not the subject of adverse possession, and is immune from the statute: Reading Co. v. Seip, 30 Pa. Superior Ct. 330. When a railroad company condemns land it is of necessity the judge of how much is required for its use. If this question were submitted to a jury in every case, the right of eminent domain would be of little practical value. The company had a right, when it condemned the property, to regard and make provision for its future, as well as its present needs: Pittsburg, Ft. W. & C. Ry. Co. v. Peet, 152 Pa. 488; Pittsburg Junction R. R. Co.’s App., 122 Pa. 511. July 14, 1909: The nonuser of a portion for present purposes cannot be held to be an abandonment: Hummel v. Cumberland Valley R. R. Co., 175 Pa. 537. S. J. Strauss, for appellee. — The act of the railroad company in fencing this land out of its right of way is conclusive upon the company.\",\n",

Barbed-wire fences—Chapter 755, Laws of 1894 — Construction by tenant. Where a tenant, holding under a lease which provides that the landlord “ will furnish some wire and posts to repair or make fences with and the lessee is to do the work,” of his own motion strings a strand of barbed wire wholly upon his own side of an existing worm rail division fence by leading the barbed wire from one to another of the joint locks or angles of the fence, he is liable under the provisions of section 1, chapter 755 of the Laws of 1894, to the adjoining owner for the value of a horse which became entangled in the barbed wire and was injured so that it was no longer of any use to its owner. 3. Same — Repairs made with barbed wire. Since the passage of the statute, barbed wire can no more be used in the repair of fences than it can be used in their construction. 3. Liability of owner to fence — Construction by tenant. The statutory duty imposed upon an owner of land to build and maintain a proper division fence does not carry with it a liability against such owner for damages occasioned by the construction of an improper fence, which construction was wholly the act of the tenant. 4. Lease — Liability of landlord for act of tenant. Semble, that the fact that a lease provides that a landlord will furnish some wire and posts for the purpose of repairing or making fences, does not make him liable for the act of the tenant in stringing a barbed wire, without the privity of the landlord, along an existing division fence, and this, notwithstanding the fact that the tenant had procured certain barbed wire for fencing purposes at the expense of the landlord. 5. Wrongdoers — Nonjoinder. As a person injured by a tortious act may sue all or any of the wrongdoers, it is not a defense' to one of them that another is-not joined; and in any event the nonjoinder cannot be considered where the question is not raised by the answer. 6. Barbed-wire fences — Chapter 534, Laws of 1896. Chapter 524 of the Laws of 1896 had not the effect of repealing chapter 755 of the Laws of 1894, and its only effect is to permit the use of barbed wire in division fences, without the consent of the adjoining owner, providing the fences are constructed in the manner-prescribed by the statute of 1896. Action to recover treble damages under chapter 755 of the Laws of 1894. A jury trial was waived by the parties and the case submitted upon the following agreed state of facts: Cornelius T. Archer, Daniel Buckley and Thomas Clark, all reside in the town of Porter, county of Niagara, and state of New York. Archer and Buckley are the owners of adjoining farms in the aforesaid town, which farms are separated by a wormrail division fence, with joint locks alternating upon the farms of said Archer and. Buckley. Ro barb wire was originally used, in the' construction of said division fence. At all times mentioned in the complaint, Clark was lawfully in possession of and occupying the farm of Archer under the written lease of said farm from Archer to Clark, for a term of three year’s from March 1, 1894, to March 1, 1897. At the times mentioned in the complaint ■ Archer had neglected and was neglecting to make a sufficient division fence in accordance to the regulation prescribed for the town of Porter. Under the terms of' said lease, in the month of April, 1895J, Clark procured barb wire for fencing purposes at the expense of Archer, and thereafter and because of the insufficiency of that portion of the line fence above described to be maintained by said Archer, strung a single barbed wire parallel to and-along and upon a part of that portion of the division fence which, by agreement between Buckley and Archer, should be maintained by Archer and which had thereafter been maintained by him. Said barbed wire was fastened to joint locks of said wormrail division fence, which joint locks stood wholly on the farm of said Archer; then from said joint locks to the next joint locks standing wholly on the farm of Archer and so on till said wire had been strung to' about twelve of said joint locks, each of which stood wholly upon the farm of .Archer. The wire so strung was wholly upon and over the property of Archer and at no point upon or over the property of Buckley or over an angle of said worm fence projecting from the property óf Buckley to a joint lock on the farm of Archer. Clark did not obtain the written consent or any consent of Buckley to the stringing of said single barbed wire as aforesaid.. Buckley at the time mentioned herein was occupying and in possession of his ■adjoining farm and was the owner of a gray mare worth $80, which jumped Over said wormrail division fence aforesaid, in the month of (September, 1895, became entangled in the aforesaid barbed wire and was cut, tom, wounded, braised and injured in and about the body and legs by the barbs of said wire to such an extent that she 'became sick, sore and lame and was, now is and never will be of any use or value to Buckley or to any other person on account of the injuries so received aforesaid. Buckley brought this action against Clark for treble damages for the injuries, to his horse under an act of the legislature of the state of Rew York, entitled “ An act to regulate the use of barbed wire in the construction of division fence,” passed May 22, 1894, and being chapter 755 of the Laws of 1894.

       "  'case_summary': \"HENDERSON v. WALKER. 1. On the trial of a case involving the establishment of a dividing line between coterminous-land owners it was not error under the facts, for the court to instruct the jury: “Where an agreement establishing a dividing line between adjoining properties is followed by acquiescence and possession, the parties are concluded by their agreement; and when the acquiescence and possession have continued for the period of time prescribed by the statute of limitations, a perfect title by adverse possession is acquired. If adjoining proprietors deliberately erect monuments or fences or make improvements on a line between their lands upon the understanding that it is the true line, it will amount to a practical location.” 2. Nor was it error in such a case for the court to charge the jury as follows: “If you find this fence was established by the predecessors in title of these parties, and that the fence was on a line agreed upon (and as to that the court expresses no opinion), and that the fence has been acquiesced in by both parties for more than seven years, it would become the legal line between the parties.” 3. The verdict was authorized by the evidence. No. 3888. April 16, 1924. Equitable petition. Before Judge Eve. Irwin superior court. June 21, 1923. Mrs. M. E. Walker brought an equitable action against D. R. Henderson, and alleged in substance as follows: She is the true and legal owner of all of lot of land No. 39 in the 5th district of Irwin County, containing 490 acres, more or less, and is now in the actual possession and control of said lot, having been the owner and in possession since October 31, 1905. Columbus Graham, deceased, was the owner and in possession of all of lot of land No. 38 in the 5th land district of Irwin County, when plaintiff purchased and went into possession of lot No. 39. Columbus Graham continued to own said lands until his death, which occurred about the middle of the year 1914. Said land bounds plaintiff’s land on the east division line separating said lot. About the month of February, 1907, plaintiff desired to erect a fence on the dividing line separating her land from the land of Columbus Graham; the division line was uncertain, indefinite, and unknown, and before erecting the fence plaintiff approached Columbus Graham, with reference to agreeing upon the 'dividing line between plaintiff’s land and Graham’s land, that is between lots 38 and 39, and Graham suggested that Hon. .Manasas Henderson “be gotten,” and that he would abide by whatever line might be run out and determined by said Henderson. Plaintiff agreed to have Henderson establish the line, and ip pursuance thereof a line was run and was determined upon as being a line dividing the lands of Graham and plaintiff; said, line was run by Henderson together with M. J. Paulk and C. A. Walker (who was the son of plaintiff and who acted as agent for her), and agreed to as being the true dividing line between plaintiff’s land and the land of the said Graham. Immediately thereafter plaintiff acted upon said agreement and built her fence along said line with the knowledge and consent of Graham, and went into, possession thereof in the year 1907, and has continuously been in possession of the same until the present time. Immediately upon erecting the fence upon the land plaintiff began to clear and cultivate it, and placed it in a high state of cultivation, and has been cultivating and making crops upon it from the year 1907 until the present time. Columbus Graham never repudiated the line during his lifetime, but omthe contrary recognized it as being the dividing line between his land and plaintiff’s land until the time of his death. The fence which was built upon the dividing line is now the true line, it having been built on said line for a period of more than seven years; the adjoining-land owners have acquiesced for a period of more than seven years, and the same is established as a matter of law as the dividing line. D. R. Henderson neither as an individual nor as administrator has any legal right to encroach upon or interfere with the possession of said land by plaintiff. D. R. Henderson was duly appointed administrator of the estate of Columbus Graham, deceased, at the September term, 1914, of the court of ordinary of Irwin County, Georgia; he qualified, and began immediately to act as administrator, and is still acting in that capacity; at the October term, 1916, he as administrator obtained leave from the court of ordinary to sell 346-1/2 acres of lot 38 in the 5th district of Irwin County, the land adjoining that of plaintiff, the western boundary line of said tract being the dividing line between the land of plaintiff and that of Columbus Graham, which was agreed upon as hereinbefore set out. After due and legal advertisement the land was offered for sale at public outcry before the court-house door of the county by Henderson as administrator, and was bid off by A. S. Harris, of Irwin County, for $11,000, Harris being a man of means and worth $50,000 or more. For some reason unknown to plaintiff, Henderson as administrator has never made and executed a deed to Harris conveying the land, although plaintiff believes that Harris could make or compel the administrator to execute a deed. Henderson, after repudiating the sale as administrator to Harris, approached the heirs at law of Columbus Graham, and attempted to buy from said heirs the same land that was sold to Harris, being the 346-1/2 acres of lot 38. Henderson purchased these distributive shares while he was administrator (and he is still administrator) of the estate, for a sum considerably less than the bid that was made by Harris, and is now claiming to own in his individual capacity the land in lot 38 by reason of the purchase made from the distributees of the estate. Henderson as an individual is not the legal owner in fee simple of the land, but he is holding it in trust for the estate of Graham, deceased; and each heir at law of Graham has an interest in the title to the land, for the reason that Henderson is forbidden both by law and equity from purchasing the land from the distributees while he is acting in the capacity of administrator of the estate of Columbus Graham. D. R. Henderson, either as an individual or as administrator, is attempting to encroach upon, and threatens to take possession of, a strip of land triangular in shape, lying, in the northeastern part of plaintiff’s tract of land and adjoining the 346-1/3 acres of lot 38. Henderson has cut plaintiff’s wire fence and is entering upon her land, and has driven, or threatens to drive, away by force or otherwise, plaintiff’s hands from plowing the lands, and has staked off about ten acres, more or less, of plaintiff’s land, and is preparing to enclose it by removing plaintiff’s wire fence to the place so staked off by him. Henderson has no right or authority to enter upon the land or to interfere with plaintiff’s possession, and he has been requested to desist from so doing; but he refuses, and threatens and is actually proceeding to make preparations to take forcible possession of plaintiff’s land. She has placed this land in a high state of cultivation and has been producing large crops on it for the past thirteen years, and she is entitled to protection in a court of equity from being interfered with in the possession of the land by Henderson or any other person. If Henderson, either as an individual or as administrator, is permitted to destroy and tear 'down plaintiff’s fence and remove it from the established line on which it was erected, and to drive away plaintiff’s hands by force, and is permitted to take possession of plaintiff’s land, she will be irreparably damaged, and it will be necessary for her to bring an action at law to eject Henderson individually or as administrator, or probably the heirs at law of Columbus Graham, deceased; and thereby a multiplicity and circuity of suits will be necessary. Plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law, and cannot prevent such illegal interfering with her possession except through a court of equity. She prays that D. E. Henderson, individually and as administrator, be restrained and enjoined from tearing down and destroying her fence, from driving away and interfering with her work-hands, and from fencing or working or entering, either directly or indirectly by himself, his agents or confederates, upon the land now owned and in possession of plaintiff; that he be enjoined from taking possession or attempting to take possession of the ten acres of land, more or less, before referred to; that upon the final trial he be required to account to plaintiff for the damage done in cutting her fence and in driving away her work-hands, and for general relief. The defendant filed an answer in which he denied some of the allegations of the petition and admitted others. He avers that the rights of the plaintiff are confined to lot of land No. 39 and that she has no right, title, or interest in any portion of lot No. 38. He owns and is in possession of lot No. 38; he does not assert any right or title to any portion of lot No. 39, and is not in possession of any portion of said lot, and is not seeking to get possession of any portion thereof.

Neither party knew the location of the boundaries except as described by deed, there being no monuments on the ground, but it was understood that defendant would have the land surveyed when ready to build. Thereafter defendant, on the advice of plaintiff’s father who acted for plaintiff, had a survey made by the city engineer, built a house, and erected a fence around the premises according to such survey. Plaintiff’s father saw the improvements being made, but made no objection to the boundaries as fixed by the survey. Held, that plaintiff was estopped from thereafter asserting that such boundaries were incorrect, it appearing that a change to the line, claimed by plaintiff would result in bringing defendant’s line so near his house as to materially damage his property.

Before Merctjr, C. J., Gordok, Pax-soN, Truxkey, Sterrbtt, Grebx and Clark, JJ. Error to the Court of Common Pleas No. 2, of Allegheny county: Of October and November Term, 1884, No. 58. Assumpsit, by James G. Allison against Thomas Montgomery to recover the price of a mowing machine and thirty-live bushels of wheat; also damages alleged to have resulted from the breach of a parol gift of land, by defendant, to plaintiff and wife. On the trial, before Kirkpatrick, J., it appeared from the testimony of the plaintiff, who was defendant’s son-in-law, that he went upon the defendant’s property to farm it for one half the crops, and, with his wife lived with the defendant in tlie latter’s house. About a month afterwards, the defendant offered to erect a small house for the plaintiff; but the latter,being dissatisfied with the character and size of the proposed dwelling, it was orally agreed between the parties that the plaintiff should put up a house and out-buildings to suit himself, on a twelve acre lot which defendant had recently bought and attached to his farm. It was further claimed by plaintiff, that in order to induce him to build,'the defendant promised to execute to him and his wife, a deed for the twelve acre lot. Plaintiff’s testimony as to this was, inter alia, as follows : “After I was married he (the defendant) talked about building a small house, and he said if he would put that house up, in the course of a year or so it would be no use to me or any other person, for he would tear it down, and he talked on and said, if there’s a house built on these twelve acres, I will deed it to you and your wife. He said: ‘You go to work and build that house,’ and I did it under his instructions, building it where he told me. He also said: ‘ all improvements you make you make -them there, and you have them of your own, while if I build this house all the improvements you make will never do you any good.’ These were the instructions on which I went to work at the house.” The contractor who built the house also testified that Montgomery told him that “he would make them a deed” for the twelve acres when the house was completed. Plaintiff accordingly had the house and a stable built by a contractor, dug a well and put a paling fence around the house. He then moved into the house, with his famity, and continued to live there for about three years when he stopped farming and removed to Allegheny city. Before moving he sold all his personal property except a mowing machine and some standing wheat. He afterwards helped to harvest the wheat and he left his share, about fifty bushels, with the mowing machine, in charge of the defendant. Fifteen bushels of wheat were afterwards obtained by him, but the remaining thirty-five bushels and the machine, as alleged by him, still remained in possession of the defendant, and were appropriated by him. It did not appear from plaintiff’s testimony that he had ever asked defendant for the machine or the wheat, or to execute the deed for the lot. Pie testified in reference to the latter, however, that: “ He (defendant) would not allow me to go at all, near the premises. We had no talk concerning jus.t the twelve acres or my going on it, at all. I gave him authority to rent the house. Pie asked me what the house would rent for and he rented it under my instructions.” Montgomery, the defendant, also testified as follows: “ Q. Did any person go to you on belialf of Mr. Allison and state that they had come to settle the matter with you in regard to this house and land? A. Yes, sir. Q. Who was it, Mr. Montgomery ? A. It was you. Q. When was it ? A. I couldn’t tell you, it was this last winter. Q. Did you not say to me that you never had agreed to give any of your land to Mr. Allison, and that you wouldn’t do it for him or his wife, or anybody ? A. I told you, sir, that I owed Mr. Allison nothing, and I had nothing to settle with you. Q. Did you not say, sir, that you never had agreed to give away any of your land to Mr. Allison and his wife. A. I have often said so, that 1 - — — Q. But you did say that he had no claim upon the land ? A. Yes, sir; never had and has not yet.” “ Q. Now do you say that you never agreed or said to Mr. Allison that if he built that house and put up those improvements they would be his own, and that you would give them a deed for the land ? A. No, sir; I never said that that would be his or anything belonging to me.” Plaintiff asked the court to charge : “1. That if the jury believe from the evidence, there was a contract made between the plaintiff and defendant, by which the defendant, in consideration of the plaintiff building with his own money a house, and making otlier improvements on a portion of defendant’s farm, comprising about twelve acres, that the defendant would give to plaintiff and his wife a deed therefor, and the plaintiff accepted said proposition and with the advice, consent, knowledge and assistance of defendant, built a bouse on said portion of defendant’s farm, and made other improvements thereon, to wit: Building a stable, a paling fence, sinking a well, etc., and paid therefor with his own money, and that defendant has refused to comply with his agreement, and to give plaintiff and his wife said deed, after the completion of said improvements, then plaintiff is entitled to recover tlie cost of making the improvements, with the interest thereon. Refused. 2. That if the jury believe from tbe evidence, such an agreement as set out in the first point was made between the plaintiff and defendant, and that plaintiff took possession and complied with the contract on his part by making valuable improvements, and expended money for insurance, taxes, etc.; and that defendant violated his part of the contract by refus-in'g, after said improvements were made, to give plaintiff and his wife a deed for said land, then the plaintiff is entitled to recover damages. Refused. 8. That the measure of damages in this action is compensation for all that the plaintiff did in pursuance of the contract, and in satisfaction of his part thereof.; and for all permanent improvements made upon the land, in reliance upon the contract with the knowledge of the defendant, and which the defendant gets the benefit of by taking back the land.” Refused. • The defendant submitted, inter alia, the following point: “ That upon the pleadings and evidence in the case, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.” “Affirmed.” Verdict for the defendant and judgment thereon ; whereupon the plaintiff took this writ assigning for error the answers to points, as above. ' McMullen (with whom was Myler'), for plaintiff in error.— An action at law will lie, by the grantee, for breach of a parol contract to convey land, the consideration being the making of improvements thereon: Bender’s Adm’rs v. Bender, 1 Wr. 420; Poorman v. Kilgore, Id. 309; Bell v. Andrews, 4 Dal. 152; George v. Bartoner, 7 W. 530; Meason v. Kaine, 63 Pa. St. R. 339; Harris v. Harris, 70 Id. 174; Ewing v. Tees, 1 Bin. '450. The evidence was sufficiently specific to go to the jury: Poorman v. Kilgore, 1 Wright 311. A. M. Brown, for defendant in error. Aside from the fact that there was no sufficient evidence of a promise to convey the land, the plaintiff’s case must fail, because his testimony shows, that there was neither a rescission nor an eviction; and that a deed for the land was neither asked for nor refused. At the very time when this suit was brought, the property was in the possession of plaintiff’s tenant, Salters, and plaintiff or his wife had received the rent. As to the wheat and the mowing machine, the plaintiff claimed to recover against defendant upon the ground of a wrongful conversion of the property, yet the testimony shows very clearly that Allison left the property at Montgomery’s against the latter’s wishes, and failed to remove it, although requested so to do; that no demand for it, or conversion of it, ever occurred, and that the suit was to recover in money more than its value.\",\n",

Widening of Town Way — Removal of Private Property — Notice — Assessment of Damages — Evidence — Extension of Time by Jury. The owner of a strip of land taken for the widening of a town way was notified by the selectmen to remove “ his trees, fences, and other property ” within a time limited. The notice recited that in their report to the town the selectmen had allowed the owners of land so taken that limit of time within which to remove such property, but the report contained no such provision. Held, that the notice was insufficient, and that such owner, upon his neglect to remove such property within the limit, could not be deemed to have relinquished it for the benefit of the town, within the meaning of the Pub. Sts. c. 49, § 80. The selectmen sent a similar notice to such owner to remove “ his buildings or material ” on the land taken within the same limit of time. Held, that no sucli relinquishment could be imputed to him upon his failure to conform thereto, and that the selectmen could deal with such property only as provided by the Pub. Sts. c. 49, § 17. Upon a petition filed by such owner for a jury to assess his damages, it appeared that certain trees and a portion of a wall upon the strip taken were destroyed or used by the town in the widening; and that it was reasonable and proper for him to move a house standing partially on the strip, as well as necessary to fence his remaining land, and to grade it to the level of the way as constructed upon the widening. Held, that the value of the trees and wall, and the cost of the moving, fencing, and grading, were proper elements of damage to be considered by the jury. At the trial of the petition it appeared that in the widening a strip equal in width to that of the petitioner was taken upon the opposite side of the way, and the respondent sought to set off against the petitioner’s damages the benefit from the widening beyond that resulting from the taking of his land for that purpose. The petitioner was permitted to introduce evidence that the public had for over twenty years used the strip on the opposite side of the street as a sidewalk, and had thereby gained a right by prescription to use it for that purpose. Held, that the evidence was competent. The petitioner in the petition prayed for further time to remove his building from the strip taken, and the jury was permitted to extend his time for such removal in a verdict returned by them for the petitioner. Held, that the jury had no authority under the Pub. Sts. c. 49, § 81, to extend the time for the removal of buildings, but that such portion of the verdict might be set aside, and judgment be rendered for the petitioner upon the remainder. Petition to the Superior Court, filed November 18, 1887, for a jury to assess the damages caused by the taking by the respondent of land of the petitioner for the widening of Liberty Street, a town way in Foxborough, and praying for further time for removing a house partially standing thereon. Trial in the Superior Court, before Bishop, J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows. It appeared that Liberty Street was first laid out- as a town way thirty-three feet wide in 1857, and as then laid out the northerly line of the street formed the southerly boundary of the petitioner’s land. In October, 1887, the town widened Liberty Street, and in so doing took seven feet on the southerly side of the petitioner’s land, into which projected a corner of his house. The report of the selectmen thereon to the town was made on October 10, and accepted by the town on October 19, but contained no provision as to the time within which the trees, fences, and other property on the land taken should be removed. The selectmen, however, in a report made by them to the town, also on October 10, with reference to the laying out of Wall Street in continuation of Liberty Street, stated that “ we have allowed each of the owners of land through which said way passes twenty days after the acceptance of this laying out by the town to take off his trees, fences, and other property which may obstruct the building of such way.” The petitioner put in evidence a notice from the selectmen dated and served on him on October 29, 1887, which stated that the “ selectmen of Foxborough, on the tenth day of this October, A. D. 1887, laid out a widening of Liberty Street in said Foxborough, which widening passes in part over land belonging to you; said part belonging to you included in said widening being described as follows. o [Here follows a description of the land taken.] Said laying out was accepted by the town at a town meeting held on the nineteenth day of said October, A. D. 1887. And in said laying out we allowed each of the owner’s of land through which said way passes twenty days after the acceptance of the laying out by the town to take off all the fences and other property which may obstruct the building of such way. You are hereby notified to remove your trees, fences, and other property v hich may obstruct the building of said way, within twenty days from date of said acceptance.” The petitioner also put in evidence another notice from the selectmen to him, dated November 14,1887, which stated that “At a town meeting of the town of Foxborough, held on the nineteenth day of October, A. D. 1887, the town accepted of a widening of Liberty Street in said town ; a part of said widening took certain land of yours, fully described in notice from this board to you, dated the twenty-ninth day of October, 1887, to which reference is hereby made for a more full and particular description thereof; and in said laying out the owners of land so taken were allowed twenty days from the date of the acceptance thereof in which to remove buildings or materials on such land so taken; and the twenty days so allowed having expired, and you having refused or neglected to take care of or to remove the building or material on the land so taken from you, you are hereby notified that unless you remove the buildings and materials on land so taken within five days from this date, we, as the selectmen and highway surveyors of said town, shall take care of, remove, or sell such buildings and material, according to the provisions of sections 80 and 17 of chapter 49 of the Public Statutes.” The petitioner testified that he did not remove any of said property, and made no effort to do so, and that he made no request for further time, and did nothing further in regard to the property, after receiving either notice; and no sale was made by the town. There was a quantity of stones of various sizes on the petitioner’s land along the line of Liberty Street, forming an irregular pile or wall, which the petitioner had collected from his land, and which had been accumulating for many years. Some of these stones were taken in the widening an.d used in building a sidewalk on the strip of land taken, and adjoining the petitioner’s remaining land, seven feet in width, and varying from ten to twenty-four inches in height above the petitioner’s land, and some were removed and used in building another street,' and a large portion were left upon the land. The petitioner contended that four fruit-bearing apple trees which stood upon the strip of land taken were destroyed in the widening. The petitioner offered in evidence the cost of removing the house, the value of the stones taken and of the trees destroyed in the widening, as bearing on the measure of damages. To this evidence the respondent objected, contending that the property, or such part thereof as belonged to and was part of the realty, had been forfeited by the petitioner; but the judge admitted the evidence. It appeared in evidence that the sidewalk constructed in widening and altering Liberty Street had an average elevation above the land before the taking, and above the petitioner’s adjoining land, of fifteen inches, but that the sidewalk when built was not raised in the main above the centre of the street, which was crowned in the centre ; that the grade of Liberty Street, as to the establishment of which there was no evidence other than the fact that the crown of the street was constructed to its present height, had not been changed since its laying out in 1857 ; that no sidewalk had been constructed on the side next to the petitioner’s land until after the widening, but the public had so used the street on that side as to form a foot-path lower than the crown of the street, and on the same level with the petitioner’s adjoining land taken for the widening, which foot-path had served as a gutter during rainy weather; and that the land opposite the petitioner’s land on Liberty Street was, and had been for some years, owned by Mrs. E. P. Carpenter, whose land had formerly been unenclosed, but she had. before the widening erected a fence seven feet southerly from the southerly line of Liberty Street, which fence extended the whole length of her premises opposite the petitioner’s land. The petitioner contended that this fence had been erected more than twenty years, (which the respondent denied,) and, against the respondent’s objection, offered evidence tending to prove that the public had for twenty years or more used the strip of Mrs. Carpenter’s land between the fence and the southerly line of Liberty Street as a sidewalk, and that thereby the public had gained a right to that strip of land, which was also taken in the widening of Liberty Street and for which she was awarded damages, to be used as a sidewalk by prescription, and consequently the street had become forty feet wide, instead of thirty-three feet wide as originally laid out. The petitioner contended that the jury could not therefore set off, as against the petitioner's damages, any special benefit the widening of the street might have to the petitioner’s land, except from the widening of seven feet taken from his own land. The petitioner offered evidence to show the expense of grading up his adjoining land by a regular slope, so as to conform to the grade of the sidewalk constructed on his land taken by the widening, and of the damage resulting from cutting off his entrance to his remaining land. To this evidence the respondent objected, but the judge admitted it. The petitioner offered evidence, which was admitted against the respondent’s objection, of the cost and expense of providing a fence suitable to the land and locality, the respondent contending that the petitioner should in no event be allowed any greater sum than the value of the fence which existed before the widening. The petitioner requested, among others, the following rulings and instructions to the jury: “ 1. If the highway known as Liberty Street had, previous to the present widening, since its first laying out, been used and occupied by the public, along the side next to the petitioner’s land, at the same grade as the adjoining land of the petitioner, and without any sidewalk except such as had been created by the path along that side of the street which the public had used, this petitioner is entitled to recover for all damages arising from the construction of a sidewalk upon the land taken from this petitioner along the line of the petitioner’s remaining land, and for the raising of the level of the sidewalk constructed upon the land taken from him above the grade of the petitioner’s land, if such raising and construction is a part of the actual work .of widening said street under that taking. . . . “ 3. The use of a sidewalk for twenty years continuously and without interruption by the public as a part of the highway to which it is adjoining, which sidewalk is separated from the lands of the adjoining owner by a fence erected and maintained by the owner thereof, excluding it from his remaining lands, establishes such sidewalk as a public way by prescription. . . . “ 6. The jury may extend the time for the petitioner to remove his building from the highway as established by the taking.” The respondent requested the judge to instruct the jury as follows: “ 1. If the petitioner has not complied with the notice to remove that portion of his building, or any other property, standing on the land taken, and if the expense of said removal is equal to or exceeds the damage caused to the building, or other property, by said removal, then the petitioner cannot recover for any damage to said building, or other property, caused by said removal. “ 2. If the petitioner has not complied with the notice to remove that portion of his building standing on the land taken, and if it would be a proper and reasonable method in widening the street to remove the whole building back on the remaining land of the petitioner, the respondent has a right so to remove said building, and to place it relatively in the same position to the street .as it was before the widening, and the jury in estimating the petitioner’s damages should deduct from the total damages any reasonable expense that such removal might cause. “8. The selectmen having notified the petitioner to remove his building and other property standing on the land taken, and he having refused or neglected to remove said building or property, he cannot now recover for any damages the widening may have caused to said building or other property. “4. Public Statutes, chapter 52, section 15, does not apply to this petition. If in the original laying out of Liberty Street a grade was established, the damages to which the petitioner was then entitled included any changes in the surface of the land injurious to him, and the presumption is that the petitioner received full damages for the injury thus caused, or that he waived his claim to damages. The town had then a right to raise the street through its entire width up to the grade thus established, and the building of a sidewalk up to that grade at any time would not be a change of grade for which the petitioner could recover. If, in widening Liberty Street, the grade to which the respondents had a right to maintain it was unchanged, and the difference of grade between the street and the petitioner’s remaining land was substantially as it was before the widening, then the petitioner cannot recover, as a specific item of damages, any cost of grading the petitioner’s remaining land. If, the crown of the street has remained unchanged since the street was laid out, and there is no record evidence of what the grade at that time was, then the crown of the street must be presumed to be the height of the grade for the entire width of the street.” The judge refused to give the instructions requested by the respondent, and, after having instructed the jury that in determining the amount of pecuniary damage, or loss, if any, suffered by the petitioner, they should ascertain the value of the land taken, and the damage, if any, to the petitioner’s remaining land, and that against these should be offset such special benefit, if any, as the petitioner had received by the widening not shared by the community in general; and having defined the nature of such special benefit, and what would constitute the same, and having cautioned the jury that they should not allow any of the items bearing upon the question of damages to withdraw their attention from this principle, to which instructions no objection was made, also instructed the jury, that, in considering the way in which this widening affects the petitioner’s estate and the damage to his remaining land, it would be necessary for them to consider the cutting off of the building and the changing the grade of the sidewalk, if they found a change to have been effected adjacent to the petitioner’s land; that in considering these points they should inquire what was a proper and reasonable mode of treating the premises after widening, and whether it was a proper and prudent mode to remove the house, or to repair the end cut off; and that in general, in estimating damages, those things which are needful to be done after the widening in order to such use of the premises relatively as the petitioner had before might be considered. The judge further instructed them as follows: “ Under the statute, the selectmen fix a certain time within which the petitioner, in a case like this, may remove his house. The expense of such removal is an element of damage to be considered by you, together with the other elements and all the considerations in the case, in estimating the damages which should be given to the petitioner, in case you deem the removal of the house to be a reasonable and proper thing to do. . . . If these stones, upon the evidence before you, constitute a wall, then they are part of the realty, a part of the real estate, and this petition covers them. If, on the other hand, they were a collection of stones such as is sometimes made for the purpose of use or disposition as occasion may require, and were not a wall, they then are personal property, and are not covered by this petition. ... If there were any proof in this case, if it were a fact that the town had exercised this right of removal of the building, if the town had removed the building, it would be a proper subject, in my opinion, for deduction and offset; but I do not instruct you that you can, in passing upon the question now, — the evidence before you being that the town has not removed the building, —fix a sum to be deducted as the expense of the town, or anticipate that the town will remove it.” The judge gave the first ruling requested by the petitioner, saying that it was given subject to the general principle above stated, and that the jury should so consider it, as well as the third ruling requested by him; and further instructed the jury, “that, if you find this sidewalk before the widening was in use by the public continuously and regularly as a part of said highway for a period of twenty years or more, that throws that portion of the land open to the public, as part of the public street.” The judge also instructed the jury, “I cannot lay down to you an absolute rule as to whether you should determine that a fence or wall is a reasonable and proper thing to be placed by tbe petitioner upon bis line, as it now exists since the widening. I have already stated to you the general principles, that this property is to be treated in a reasonable and proper manner, as a prudent and wise man would do. There are circumstances under which a fence would be a very proper and indeed a necessary thing to be placed upon land after it is opened, or after a street is widened. There are other circumstances under which, after a stx-eet is widened, a jury might well come to the conclusion that a fence or wall would not be properly required by the exigencies of the case, to come in as an element in the estimation of the damages. And therefore I say that this, as well as the other elements in the case, is to be for your judgment and your consideration, under these general principles which I have laid down, as to whether it was a thing which a fair and proper treatment of the premises would call for. ... I am asked to instruct you, that ‘ the jury may extend the timé for the petitioner to remove his building from the highway as established by the taking.’ I give you that instruction, so that, if you see fit to do so, you can extend the time in which the petitioner may remove his building from the highway.” The jury returned a verdict in favor of the petitioner, and extended the time of removing the building to July 15,1888; and the respondent alleged exceptions.

The facts of the case are very fully stated in the opinion of the court. E. J. c& Owen MeG-arr, for plaintiff in error. We submit that the court below erred both in the finding of the facts, and in its conclusions of the law upon the facts established. The evidence shows that at the time the insurance was effected Jones was a sub-lessee of a part of the “Rose place,” from Oslin, the lessee of Powell; that, at the time this insurance policy was underwritten,the lease to Oslin had but two years and one and a half months to run, and that, too, subject to the important consideration that the rent reserved should be paid on the 31st of December of each year; and, in the event of a failure to pay at the day, the lessee, Oslin, surrendered and forfeited his lease. That the sub-lease to Jones had the same time to run, and was coupled with conditions, that were never even partially performed. We contend that Jones’ sub-lease from Oslin made him in effect a tenant at will,- for any forfeiture, surrender, or other termination of the lease, as between Powell, the owner, and Oslin, necessarily terminates Jones’ derivative lease. Yet Jones, when he applied for the insurance, stated to the agent of the company that he had a four years’ lease from the owner. ’ . Here, then, was a misrepresentation of two important facts, viz.: the duration of. the lease, and the person from whom he (Jones) leased, when the truth was, that he had but little over two years. The materiality of the misrepresentation made by Jones to the agent, we think, is obvious, and the concealment of the real state of affairs respecting the sub-lease, even if unintentional, presented the risk in a very different light than that in which it would have appeared had the facts been disclosed to the company’s agent, as they actually existed at the time of the insurance. It was, therefore, such a misrepresentation as must avoid the policy. Flanders on Fire Insurance, 826, 327; Columbia Ins. Co. v< Lawrance, 10 Pet. U. S., 507. Jones’ lease was subject to be determined in six Weeks, that is, at the end of the year 1870, with the further infirmity in the lease that Oslin sub-leased to Jones, upon certain .conditions (he paying rent), which he specified to perform, viz.: to put the one thousand acres in cultivation, to build fences, etc. Jones admits that he performed no part of the conditions. At the time of the loss, there was an entire want of interest in the property destroyed, so far as interest depended upon the leases; for the reason that the lease granted by Powell to Oslin was determined on the 8th of January, if not before, by the voluntary act of Oslin in abandoning the place, and his forfeiture for non-payment of rent, nearly a mo\\'nth before the fire occurred, and the derivative lease of Jones then ended. The declaration does not allege that Jones had any interest in the property at the time of the fire. 2 Atkyns, 634; Flanders, 341. $1200 of the $2000 insurance, was on the gin house, and for that portion Jones had no claim on the company. Kutler v. Smith, 2 Wallace, 491. As to the gin stand and press, we contend that, as they were put up on the place and were attached to the land, Jones had no right, in the absence of an agreement, to remove them, after the expiration - of his sub-lease. The law in relation to fixtures would give the owner of the freehold a right to hold them as a part of the freehold. Richardson v. Borden, 42 Miss., 71. Jones states that two bales of the cotton belonged to him-, and that in the residue he had a half interest, but that, owing to the state of his accounts with Oslin, he considered that he had an interest equal to three-fourths of the ten bales, and no settlement had been made between them. The defendant in error introduced no testimony to show the value of any property destroyed, or the actual loss to him in consequence of the fire, except his own statement. He says the gin house, and fixtures therewith, was worth to me $1000.,, This is no criterion of the real value of the property. The actual value is what should be ascertained, and that should guide the jury and the court in assessing the damages. The value oí the whole property destroyed, except the cotton, is based on the supposition that he had, at the time of the fire, \\'two or three years unexpired lease, when, in law and in fact, his sub-lease had terminated. Again, the record shows that there was no replication by plaintiff to the pleas of defendant; there was no issue joined. Steele v. Palmer, 41 Miss., p. 88; Hogan v. Lewellen, 42 Miss., 302; Armstrong v. Barlow, 42 Miss., 506. In this case there was not only a plea of the general issue, but special pleas in bar, unanswered when the cause was tried. Q-eo-. L. Poitor^ on the same side, filed an elaborate brief. Upton M Young, for defendant in error. It is^clear, from the evidence, that at the date of insurance, and at the time of the loss, Jones had an insurable interest in the property covered by the policy. He had repaired the gin house, worth $1600; built the press, worth $400; bought the gin stand from Oslin for $180; stand and fixtures worth $1000; he owned absolutely two bales of cotton, worth $150, and three-fourths of all the cotton destroyed. Eighteen • thousand pounds belonged to him; his contract with Oslin was for one-fourth of the crop; the hands were to have one-half. They owed to Jones on that half nearly $2000, -for supplies furnished by him individually. So it will be seen that the property destroyed far exceeded, in value, the respective amounts for which it was insured, and that the aggregate loss occasioned by the fire, was, in point of fact, between three and four, instead of two, thousand dollars. Jones was, during all the time from January, 1870, working under this contract, oral or written, with Oslin, and was openly and notoriously in possession of the property insured. The deed of trust of Oslin, for McOutchen & Oo., Avas acknowledged November 21st, 1870, and filed for record November 29th, 1870. The policy in favor of McOutchen et al., was obtained 21st November, 1870. The inference is fair that McOutchen et al., or Oslin, or all, were endeavoring, late in the year 1870, to defraud (by recording, at a strange and suspicious day, liens pretending to bear date as far back as January,) Jones, or the laborers whom he supplied. From this corollary, we conclude that, at the date of Jones’ policy, and prior to that time, he had a direct and positive interest in the property insured ; an interest vested in him by Oslin; an interest acquired by purchase and labor, made and bestowed, in pursuance of his contract with Oslin, in January, 1870, over which interest in said property, he exercised ownership, actual possession and control, and that Oslin, McOutchen, Folkes & Oo. and Powell, had actual notice of Jones’ interest before he had any notice, actual or constructive, of the several liens, finally recorded by these parties. It follows, therefore, that on the 1st day of December, 1870, Jones’ interest was clearly an insurablp one ; and, as the testimony shoAvs, that there was no fraud on his part, in obtaining the policy, he ought to recover. See 42 Miss., 447; 43 Miss., 456. Having revieAved this case to ascertain the precise character of client’s interest in the property destroyed, Ave will noAV examine what is necessary to constitute, in legal parlance, insurable interest. The quantity and quality of interest necessary to secure a valid policy is not great. The insured must, of course, have an interest of some kind, and which, if the loss or damage by fire — the event insured against in this case — should transpire, might \"bring upon the insured apeeuniary loss. Garter v. Humboldt Ins. Co., 12 Iowa, 287. It is sufficient to affirm that “the interest must be a direct one- in reference to perils, insured against. Phil, on Ins., vol. 1, p. 107. It has been repeatedly held that a conditional interest is a sufficient subject for insurance, ib., p. 180. So a valid executory contract, for a thing, ib., 100. So the benefits arising from business, or from commercial transaction. A bailee has an insurable interest in property in his custody, as to what constitutes an insurable interest. See Tyler v. .¿Etna, Ins. Go. 16 Wend., N. Y., 238. A mortgagee has an insurable interest. Eeller v. Merchants’ Ins. Go., 7 La. An., 29 ; Addison v. Louisville Ins. Go., 7 B. Monroe, 470. A lien on a house for work or materials constitutes án insurable interest. Franklin Fire ins. Go. v. Goats, 14 Md., 285. So is a mechanic’s lien. Stout v. City Fire Ins. Go., N. H., 12 Iowa, 371; ib, 284. Jones had an additional interest, a mechanic’s lien on the\\' gin house, gin and gearing, press and fixtures. Rev. Code, 1871, § 1603. • A failure to deliver did no.t work a forfeiture — though it might have been a breach of the contract, or covenant, if a demand had been made. The possession of the plantation by Powell, was aforcible one. He was a trespasser. Oslinwas in possession of the “Rose plantation,” through his agent, on the 8th day of January, 1871, and Jones was occupying the premises openly and notoriously, under his lease from Oslin, and these facts were known to Powell and McCutchen. There was no forfeiture of Jones’ lease which was to terminate in January, 1873. Titles by forfeiture are disfavored both at law and inequity, 2 Story, Eq. Jur., sec. 1314, 1315-, 1316. Conditions tending to destroy estates are construed with great rigor to prevent forfeiture. 2 Cruise Dig., ch. 2, p. 27 ; 15 Johnson’s Rep., 278. Jones made no misrepresentation of facts material to the risk. Even if he had, the policy, would be regarded as good, until avoided by due proof of facts. Carpenter v. Prov. Washington Ins. Co., 16 Peters, 495. In perfect good faith.he stated, and the policy shows on its face that he stated, that he was on leased premises. He insured the property greatly under its value, and paid, the premium. This last circumstance was agreeable to the company. .Refusing a new trial was no error. Kelly et. aL v.

Note. — For other definitions, see Words and Phrases, First and Second Series, Homestead.] Appeal from District Court, Bowie County; H. F. O’Neal, Judge. Partition suit by Mrs. Viola Fortner and others against J. S. Evans. Judgment for plaintiffs, and defendant appeals. Affirmed. Appellant and Mary A. Mitton, a widow, were married in 1878. In February, 1892, they purchased three unimproved building lots (50 by 140 feet each, and numbered 1, 2, and 3, respectively) in Texarkana, around which they at once constructed a fence. In the fall of that year (1892) appellant built a dwelling house on lot 3, having segregated it from lot 2 by a fence constructed on the line between them, and a few years later built a dwelling house on lot 2, part of which, by a fence constructed thereupon, he had segregated from the remainder thereof and from lot 1. The houses were built to rent, and Were never used or occupied by others than tenants. In the fall of 1900 or 1901 appellant constructed a dwelling house on lot 1, which, with a part of lot 2, had been segregated, as stated, from the remainder'of the land, and thereafterwards, until the death of Mrs. Evans in 1914, occupied and used this dwelling house, and lot 1 and the part of lot 2 inclosed with it as his home, and after the death of his wife continued to so occupy and use same. Appellee Mrs. Viola Fortner was the daughter of Mrs. Evans by her first husband and was her only heir. The suit was by Mrs. Fortner, joined by her husband, against appellant, to partition lot 3 and the part of lot 2 not inclosed, as stated, with lot 1. The defense interposed by appellant was that said lot 3 and said part of lot 2 were a part of his homestead, and therefore were not subject to partition during his lifetime, or so long as he elected to use or occupy same as a home. The court, before whom the trial was had without a jury, found facts as stated above, and further found: (1) That the property Mrs. Fortner sought to have partitioned belonged to the community estate between her mother (who died intestate) and appellant; (2) that at the time he improved the three lots as stated appellant dug a well on each of them, and afterwards continuously “rented out lots 2 and 3 to tenants whenever he could procure tenants therefor, and has never lived on or used either of lots 2 or 3 for homestead purposes, except the small portion of the north side of lot No. 2 inclosed with lot No. 1, but, on the other hand, it was his purpose to use lots 2 and 3 for the purposes of renting them out to tenants and thereby securing an income from which to partially make a living”; and (3) that all of lot No. 2 not inclosed with lot No. 1 and all of lot No. 3 were subject to partition. Tbe appeal is from á judgment directing a partition to be made as prayed for by Mrs. Fortner. E. Newt Spivey and E. E. Weaver, both of Texarkana, for appellant.

Whore two persons contract to maintain and cultivate an olive ranch, contemplating, not a division of the property, but its building up, operation, and sale as a whole, but making no distinct or specific agreement 'to that effect, one party may enforce a division, under Code Civil Proc. Cal. § 7C3, providing that the court must order a partition “unless the property is so situated that partition cannot be made without great prejudice to the owners;” and the fact that defendant is a lawyer practicing in a distant state, having no knowledge of farming or olive culture, and that plaintiff would be unable to buy in the property if it should be sold as a whole, are unimportant in the determination of the question, for the situation of the property, not the circumstances of the parties, must control. 2. Same--Olive Ranch — Divisibility. Where an olive ranch is so large that it can be divided into two large orchards, such as to justify the building of works for either the manufacture of oil or the pickling of the olives, one of two tenants in common can enforce partition, under Code Civil Proc. Cal. § 703, which secures this right unless great prejudice to the owners would result because of the situation of the property. 3. Same — Expenses—Mistaken Estimate. One of two tenants in common agreed to share the expense of a house, to be built by his eotenant at an estimated expense of $400. Owing to a mistake in the estimates of the material man and damage by a storm while building, the house actually cost $700. Held, that upon partition, the expense should be equally shared, and the house be regarded as the property of both parties. 4. Same — Accounting—Interest. An agreement between two tenants in common of an olive ráneh provided that one of them should pay the other a certain sum for a failure to plant certain trees. The debtor under this agreement began a suit for partition, thereby putting it out of his power to fulfill the contract. Held, that upon partition he should be charged with that sum, with interest from the date of the commencement of the suit. 5. Same. One of two tenants in common of an olive ranch, who agrees with his eotenant to givo his whole time and attention to the cultivation of he ranch, and who thereafter enforces a partition, should be charged with one half of his profits in ieal-estato dealings carried on by him while the agreement was in force, and causing his absence from the ranch for considerable periods of time. 6. Same — Necessary Expense. A suit for the partition of an olive ranch was brought by one of its two tenants in common, who, pending the suit, incurred necessary expenses in caring for the ranch. Held, that the cotenant should be charged with one half such expenses, with interest from the time of the respective payments, although he had given notice that he would not hold himself responsible for running expenses. 7. Same — Agreement to Share — Expense op Fencing. An agreement by two tenants in common to share the expense of fencing includes the expense of a survey necessary to determine the boundary of tlm land.

       "  'case_summary': 'The Board of Commissioners of Pilots v. John H. Clark and Samuel H. Seaman, Survivors of Henry B. Cromwell, deceased. A lease of a public wharf from the mayor, &a, of New York, does not confer upon the lessee the exclusive right to its possession, use or control. By the force of the lease, he only becomes entitled to the wharfage accruing thereat. Under such lease, such wharf continues a public wharf, and all vessels resorting to it are subject to the general rules of law regulating the use of wharves, slips and piers, añd the mooring and stationing of vessels. And the vessels of the lessee are subject to the same rules,•&c., as other vessels using said wharf. Such lessee cannot lawfully place structures upon such pier for his own convenience, which shall materially incumber it, or interfere with its free use for purposes connected with navigation, by the general public. A firm acting as the common agent of several lines of vessels, causing such structure to be erected and maintained for their accommodation as such agents, though they charge the expense thereof to \\'Such vessels, or lines of vessels, are the actors in making such obstructions, and are liable therefor. Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court. The action was brought to recover certain penalties imposed by a statute passed in 1858, in the following words: “ Whenever any pier or bulkhead in the port of Hew York shall be incumbered, or its free use interfered with, by merchandise, lumber, or any other obstructions, whether of loose material, or built upon, or affixed to the pier or bulkhead, it shall be the duty of the commissioners [of pilots] to notify the person or persons placing or keeping such merchandise or obstruction on such pier or bulkhead, to remove such merchandise or obstruction within twenty-four hours after such notice; and in case of failure to comply with such notice and to remove such merchandise or obstruction, the person or persons so notified shall be liable to pay to the commissioners the sum of twenty-five dollars for each and every day during which such merchandise or obstruction shall remain on such pier of bulkhead,” &c. The defendants, at the time when the penalties were alleged to have been-incurred, and at the time of commencing the action, on the 14th January, 1864, composed the firm of H. B. Cromwell & Co., but Mr. Cromwell died, after issue joined, on the 3d day of April, in that year, and the action was continued against the two other defendants as survivors. The alleged obstruction was upon pier No. 9, North river, and it consisted in the erection and maintaining a structure used as a shed upon the pier, the westerly or river end of which building was about three feet from the outer extremity of the pier and extended quite across the pier, a distance of about forty feet. This end was called, in the complaint and by the plaintiffs’ witness, a fence. It was ten feet high, or more, and had a sliding gate in it about nine or ten feet wide, and a smaller gate at the side. After its erection, and on the 3d December, 1863, the plaintiffs caused to be served upon the defendants a copy of a resolution of their board, and a notice, to the effect that the defendants were required to remove the obstruction within twenty-four hours from the time of the service. It was not removed until after the commencement of the action, when the end complained of was taken down by the defendants. The amount of penalties incurred, if the defendants were liable, was $925. The questions litigated were\\': 1. Whether the structure was an obstruction in the sense of the act, and, 2. Whether the two surviving defendants, against whom the action was depending at the time of the trial, were responsible for-its maintenance. On the trial before Mr. Justice Davis and a jury, it appeared that the shed was erected by the lessee of the pier for the purpose of protecting property received from vessels, or brought there to be shipped, from rain and from thieves, until it should be removed; that the class of vessels which came to the end of the pier to load or to be discharged were lighters and canal boats, and vessels having a single hatch. As to the actual effect of the fence on the use of the pier, a witness for the plaintiff, who was -their, agent, testified that the erection prevented the use of the pier by persons who wanted to get down with carts, and also prevented its use by vessels wishing to unload at the end of the pier. He also swore that when he called upon Mr. Clark, one of the defend ants, respecting the fence, in October, 1863, and asked him to remove it, he said they (his firm) kept it there to keep vessels away.; that they did not wish anybody to come there, and wanted to occupy the pier exclusively for them own use. The defendant Clark, as a witness for the defendants, denied having made the statement attributed to him. He testified that he had seen lighters and canal boats discharge at the end of the pier while the alleged obstruction was there; that they \"would swing the goods through the gate inside the shed without difficulty, and that the fence did not interfere at all in discharging lighters and- canal boats. Upon the question whether the surviving defendants were so connected with the erection as to be responsible, the facts were, that the three original defendants were partners in the commission business, as agents for steamers running out of Hew York, acting as ships’ husbands and having the sole direction in Hew York of the business of the steamers for which they were concerned. The defendant Cromwell was the owner of a line of steamers running between Hew York and Portland, Maine, and of another line running to Hew Orleans, except that in one of them another person was the owner of one-ninth part; that these vessels were within the agency of Cromwell & Co., who advertised them; and they came to this pier. ■ Mr. Cromwell was also the lessee in his own name of the pier, and he .caused the shed to be erected, the other defendants not being interested, as Mr. Clark swore, in that work. When it was taken down it was done in consequence of the advice of defendants’ counsel in the suit, by persons in the employment of the firm. A person named Pier-son attended to the business of the steamers on the dock, where there was an office, and where he was constantly employed. His wages were paid by the firm and charged to the steamers; the erection of the shed was also paid for by the firm and charged to the steamers, the expense being divided among them; and so of the expense of taking down the fence. The rent of the wharf under the lease to Cromwell was paid by the steamers, it being.divided among them, through the firm, who kept all the accounts respecting the steamers and the wharf. When other parties paid wharfage it went to the benéfit of Cromwell’s lines, relieving them from the rent to that extent. It \"appeared that Mr. Cromwell was confined to his house by illness during the time for which the penalties were claimed, and that he was represented in the business relating to the steamers by the other defendants. \\' The pier in question was shorter than those on each side of it. The defendants’ counsel offered to\\' show that the space between the two adjoining piers, at the end of pier Mo. 9, was so narrow that vessels larger than a lighter could not lie at and discharge on the end; but the evidence was objected to and excluded. They also offered to show that other piers in the city had similar fences across the ends, but this testimony was also excluded.\" The plaintiffs’ counsel inquired of a witness, who was the agent of the plaintiffs, how he came to go to the office of Cromwell & Co., on the occasion when he said he did go there, and spoke with. Mr. Clark; to which the defendants interposed an objection, which was overruled,- and the witness said it was because they occupied that pier. The defendants’ counsel excepted to these several rulings. The defendants’ counsel moved to dismiss the complaint, claiming that, -upon the whole evidence, Cromwell alone was responsible, and he having died before the_ trial, the plaintiffs could not recover against any one. They also claimed that under an act of April 15, 1858 (ch. 261), the steamers of Mr. Cromwell’s line were entitled \"to the entire use and occupancy-of this pier. The motion was denied, and the defendants’ counsel excepted. The defendants’ counsel then proposed a great number of propositions which they requested to have charged, which were resolvable into these: that the present. defendants had no such control of the pier, that they could remove the fence or be held chargeable for continuing it contrary, to the notice given by the plaintiffs; and that upon the evidence, the fence \"was not an obstruction of the pier within the meaning of the act. As to the first point, the judge charged that if the obstruction was placed on the pier or maintained there by the firm of Cromwell & Co., the action could he maintained against the defendants as survivors of Mr. Cromwell; but if that person individually possessed and controlled the pier, and the firm merely used it for the accommodation of the vessels for which they were agents, and which vessels were mainly owned by Cromwell, and that the firm as agents and ships’ husbands had nothing to do with the pier itself so far as its control-was concerned, or the advantage to be derived from its use as affecting the vessels, then the wrong for. which the penalty , was provided would be that of Cromwell individually, and the defendants, as surviving partners of the firm, would not be liable in this action. The judge then recapitulated the testimony bearing upon the point, in the course of which, after stating the alleged admission of Mr. Clark, and the general character of the acts which the firm were accustomed to perform in connection with the pier and the vessels, he said: “ upon this evidence which certainly makes out a prima facie case, it is-insisted that the fact should be found by you, that the firm of Cromwell & Co. were maintaining the fence.” He then stated the testimony of the two defendants, which they had given as witnesses, denying that they had any relation to or control over the pier or with his management, and did not receive any of the profits, and he concluded\\' his remarks upon this point as follows: “If you are satisfied, looking at this evidence and grouping it together, that the firm of Cromwell & Co. maintained this fence,” and if they found it to be an obstruction, “ these defendants are liable as survivors of that firm; but if you find, on the other hand, as insisted upon by the defendants, that Mr. Cromwell, as the owner of these ships, furnished it and maintained it without the ship’s1 agents having anything to do with the furnishing, or having the right to control it, then it is your duty to find for the defendants.” As to the character of the alleged obstruction and the law relating to it, the charge was as follows: “ That the free and unobstructed use of the piers in the city of Hew York, for the general purposes of trade and commerce,, is matter of public-right, which can only be abridged by act of the legislature of the State; that without special license or authority conferred directly or indirectly by act of the legislature, no private person has- a right to interfere with the free use of a pier, or to obstruct free passage over it by all persons, or access to it by all vessels lawfully engaged in trade or commerce, and having occasion to use the pier for the purposes of such business; that if the jury believed there was a fence built across the end of the pier in question, extending over- its entire width of forty feet, so as to abridge the free access and passage to and from the pier, and its free use by vessels and the public, then such fence was an obstruction within the meaning of the act upon which the suit was brought\\'; that the fact, that there was an opening by a gate in this fence through which some vessels could discharge cargo, was no defense, inasmuch as the public right protected by the law, was to a free use, and not any limited use; that even though the fence in question might have been advantageous to the shippers of goods by the lines of steamers of which the defendants were agents, and thus beneficial -to a part of the public, that was no justification for placing or keeping it, if it did in fact deprive the rest of the public of such free use of the pier as they were lawfully entitled to enjoy, and as to which the legislature had given no special privileges to the lessee of the pier. In commenting on the evidence relating to this part of the case, the judge expressed an opinion that the jury would feel very little embarrassment respecting it; “ indeed,” he added, “if the learned counsel had asked the questions, I should have felt it my duty to say to you that this was an obstruction in point of law. However, I do not go that length in submitting to you these various propositions.” He also held that the statute of April 15, 1858 (ch. 261), had no application to the case. The defendants’ counsel excepted to the several points of the cause unfavorable to them, and to the observation of the judge, that certain evidence established & grima facie case, and to his remark that he should have held the fence an obstruction in point of law, if he had been asked to do so. The verdict was for the plaintiffs; and the judgment hav- - ing been affirmed at a General Term, the defendants- brought this anneal. John E. Parsons, for the defendants and appellants. I. The question whether the fence was an incumbrance or obstruction to the pier was of fact for the jury. The plaintiffs, by one witness only, and he a man who would not give a direct answer to the simplest question, on cross-examination, attempted to show that the fence obstructed the use of the pier by vessels lying at its outer end. The defendants produced two witnesses who swore that the fence did not in any way interfere with such use. It was error, therefore, for the judge to charge that, if asked, “ I should have felt it my duty to say to you that this was an •obstruction, in point of law;” and that “the only really important issue for you is, by whom was this structure erected and maintained.” If or is this objection cured by the nominal submission, notwithstanding, of the question to the jury. Their judgment was necessarily controlled by this expression of the judge.\" For the court to say: “ as matter of law, this is an obstruction ; but I leave it for you to say whether it is or no,” is to prevent the jury from exercising their own judgment. (The N. Y. Firemen\\'s Ins. Co. v. Walden, 12 Johns., 513; Read v. Hurd, 7 Wend., 408, 411.) I. Again: It was error, the plaintiffs’ witness having sworn that the fence prevented the use of the pier by vessels lying at its outer end, to refuse to permit the defendants, on the cross-examination of this witness, and by their own witnesses in contradiction, to show that no vessel, in consequence of the narrowness of the slip, could lie across the end of the pier, with the loading or\\' unloading of which the fence could interfere. II. If, however, there was any liability it was of Hr. Cromwell personally. The present defendants and their firm neither erected nor maintained the fence; and. as to them there should have been a nonsuit. The evidence does not sustain a verdict against them; and the question submitted to the jury as to them was of law rather than of fact. 1. The agent of a vessel is not, as such, responsible for the erections upon a pier which such vessel may use. They have not even the selection of the pier, this being delegated to the harbor masters. (Laws of 1850, ch. 72.) . 2. The fact that Mr. Cromwell, who owned the vessels and who furnished to his own vessels a pier, of which he was lessee, was also a partner with Messrs. Clark and Seaman, did not, as to them, alter the case. The firm was a legal entity, quite distinct from Mr. Cromwell ; it mattered not to them what pier the vessels used, or by whom owned. ■ They were no more responsible, from the fact that Mr. Cromwell was the proprietor of the pier, than if any other person had been such proprietor. 3. If Mr. Martin, plaintiffs’ sole witness, had confined his testimony to what he knew, as shown on his cross-examination, Mr. Seaman would not even have been connected with the vessels, not to speak of the pier; and Mr. Clark, only by a single statement, alleged by Mr. Martin and denied by Mr. Clark. . The fact, however, was, and so they came forward and frankly stated, that Messrs. Clark & Seaman were the ships’ husbands, among other vessels, of Mr. Cromwell’s steamers. The motion for a nonsuit was made on these and other specific grounds, and should have been granted. III. Messrs. Clark & Seaman had no legal right, without the permission of Mr. Cromwell, to interfere with or remove the fence. He was the sole lessee of the pier, and owner, with Mr.\\'Hammett, of the vessels which used it. 1. The judge should have so charged. 2. And should also have charged, that if they had no legal right to remove- the .fence, they were not liable. 3. And, upon this ground, the defendants should have judgment. 4. Again: It was error to charge, that as ships’ husbands, they wer& prima facie liable; Even if Mr. Clark, as he denies, told Mr. Martin: “We keep the fence there to keep vessels away.” (a.) If he said so, he used the “ we ” as meaning Mr. Cromwell. (5.) As applied to himself and Mr. Seaman, the remark is proved untrue by all the testimony. (c.) Mr. Seaman could not be bound by any such statement. There was no evidence that the partnership had anything to do with the pier, and that it did cannot be proved by the admission of one partner against the other. (Collyer on Partnership, §§ 442, 443, 779.) Again: Mr. Martin, who swears to this statement, says it was made on October 6, 1863. It is not the erection, nor the maintaining, but the continuing after notice to remove, which creates the liability. This notice (the formal notice, from the service of which the jury gave the penalty) was not served till December 3, 1863. Mr. Clark’s alleged statement, if construed literally, did not, therefore, apply to the material time (that subsequent to December 3,1863), and is not inconsistent with the established fact, that these defendants had no legal power to remove the fence after the notice was served. IY. The exceptions to evidence were well taken. 1. It was proper to show the general arrangement of piers to be similar to that of pier Ho. 9. (a.) This was especially so in the view taken by the plaintiffs, that they were entitled to recover on the ground that the fence constituted a nuisance. The situation, location and comparative use and character of that which is claimed to create a nuisance, control the question of whether it does or not. (Hart v. Mayor, &c., of Albany, 9 Wend., 571; Heeker v. N. Y. Balance Dock Co., 24 Barb., 215. That such was by permission of the legislature, might be an answer to the evidence, but the statement that such was the case was no objection to the testimony. 2. What prompts a witness is quite immaterial. An improper question héle elicits a still more improper answer. The witness reasserts a mere conclusion, which he himself had disproved. Y. The foregoing points are on the basis of the correctness of the requests of the plaintiffs, charged by the judge, to which the defendants excepted. The defendants do, however, submit: Mr. Cromwell was the lessee, and as such sole owner fro Imc vice of the pier. No qualification of this ownership was proved. His employment of the pier for the purposes of trade and commerce, completely occupied it. The cases showing the right of legislative interference, cited below by the plaintiffs, apply only to streets, legally appropriated to the public use on compensation to owners, or to navigable waters, never the subject of private ownership. No case affirms the legislative control of the surface of a pier, or the constitutional right to impair the owner’s interest in it, without compensation to him. Hr. Cromwell, therefore, had the right to erect and maintain the fence. (Wetmore v. The Atlantic White Lead Co., 37 Barb., 70.) The statute in question is highly penal. To sustain the judgment the evidence must clearly show the character of the pier to be such as to bring it within the .control of the legislature without regard to private rights. (Sprague v. Birdsall, 2 Cow., 419; Millard v. Lake Ontario, Auburn & N. Y. R. R. Co., 9 How. Pr., 238.) There is no evidence that the pier in question is the extension of a street or Avhich can give any public character to it; on the contrary, the evidence is, that it is a private pier. Wm. A. Butler and J. H. Beynolds, for the respondents. • I. The fence in question, being built upon a pier in the navigable waters of the harbor of New York, and across its entire ividth, so as to interfere with its free use by the public, was a violation of the provisions of section eight of the act of April 16, 1857, establishing regulations for the port of New York (as amended), and being unauthorized by law, Avas a public nuisance, irrespective of the degree of inconvenience which it occasioned, or of any question of convenience or inconvenience. (Act April 16, 1857, Laws 1857, vol. 2, pp. 487, 488; Act April 15, 1858, Laws 1858, p. 363; Fowler v. Saunders, Cro. Jac., 446; The King v. Russell, 6 B. & C., 566; The King v. Carlisle, 6 Carr. &. Payne, 636; The King v. Ward, 4 Ad. & E., 384; Hart v. The Mayor of Albany, 9 Wend., 571; The People v. Cunningham, 1 Den., 524; Davis v. The Mayor of New York, 4 Kern., 506, and see p. 525, and cases collected there; The People v. Vanderbilt, 38 Barb., 282; S, C., 26 N. Y., 287.) 1st. The-court correctly charged the jury in the five several propositions in reference to obstructions on the piers of the port of New York, as follows: First. That the free and unobstructed use of the piers in the city of New York, for the general purposes of trade and commerce, is matter of public right, which can only be abridged by act of the legislature of the State. Second. That without special license or authority, conferred, directly or indirectly, by act of the legislature, no private person has any right to interfere with the free use of a pier, or to obstruct\\' free passage over it by all persons, or access to it by all vessels lawfully engaged in trade or commerce, and having occasion to use the pier for the purpose of such business. Third. That if the jury believed there was a fence across the end of the pier in question, extending over its entire width of forty feet, so as to abridge the free access and passage to and from the pier, and its free use by vessels or the public, then such fence was an obstruction within the meaning of section eight of the act to establish regulations for the port of New York. Fourth. That the fact that there was an opening by a gate in this fence, through which some vessels could discharge cargo, is no defense, inasmuch as the public right, protected by the law, is to the free use, and not to any limited use. Fifth, That even though the fence in question might have been advantageous to the shippers of goods, by the lines of steamers of which defendants were agents, and thus beneficial to a part of the public, this is no justification for placing or keeping it, if it did, in fact, deprive the rest of the public of such free use of the pier as they were lawfully entitled to enjoy, and as to which the legislature have given no special privilege to the lessee of the pier. (See cases cited above, and also as to the public right in the piers in the port of New York, and the power of the legislature to regulate their use; Act April 17, 1784, Jones and Yarick, p. 125, §8;. Act March 31, 1801, Davies’ Laws relating to the city of Hew York, p. 400, § 9; Act April 19, 1813, id., p. 559, § 235; Act April 19, 1830, id., p. 705, § 1; Act April 16, 1857, Laws 1857, vol. 2, p. 487, § 8; Act April 15, 1858, Laws 1858, p. 363, § 5; Vanderbilt v. Adams, 7 Cow., 349.) 2. There was no error in the remark of the learned judge, to the effect that, if so requested, he would have felt it his duty to instruct the j-tiry that the fence was an obstruction .in point of law. He left the question of fact to the jury, and to the expression of his opinion on the question of law, no exception will lie, especially as that opinion was fully sustained by the authorities. (See cases, supra, under first point.) 3. The jury having passed upon the question of- fact, put in issue by the answer, as to the fence being actually an interference with the free use of the pier, its illegality is established by the verdict, and cannot be reviewed on this appeal. II. The judge, at the trial, properly left to the jury the question of fact, by whom the obstruction was placed or kept upon the pier; and there was no error in his refusal to dismiss the complaint at the\\' close of the evidence, or in his instructions to the jury in reference to the parties liable for the penalty. ,1st. The evidence clearly showed that the fence was erected in connection with, and for the benefit of, the business of the line of steamers of which the firm of H. B. Cromwell & Co. were agents and managers, and in respect to which they held themselves out to the public as the sole proprietors, in their firm name; that they had and exercised absolute control over the pier, in respect to the entire business of the ships composing the line, and that when notified by the plaintiffs to remove the obstruction, they gave no intimation that the wrong party was notified, but frankly avowed themselves as maintaining it, stated the object for which it had been erected, and their unwillingness to have it removed. It was a question of fact for the jury to say whether the firm, or only the senior member of it, who was confined to Ms house by the illness of which he afterwards died, during the entire period after the notice was given, were the parties who actually, and especially after the notice, placed or kept the obstruction on the pier. And it was a question for the jury, whether they believed Martin’s positive testimony as to Clark’s declarations, or Clark’s inferential and argumentative denial. 2d. The question o\\'f the liability of Clark and Seaman, as survivors, was left to the jury, under instructions by the court, which gave the defendants the benefit of every ruling to which they were entitled, and the several exceptions to the charge, in this respect, are untenable. (a.) There was no error in the instruction that the defendants were sued as members of the firm of H. B. Cromwell & Co. They were so sued, and the action was continued against the present defendants as survivors. They were, of course, liable as such survivors, provided the jury found that the acts complained of were done by the firm, and they did so find. (1).) Mor was there error in the instruction that it was only necessary for plaintiffs to show that the firm of H. B. Cromwell & Co. committed the alleged offense. The film, and not its individual members, were the parties complained of. (e.) Mor was there error in the further remark of the court that the excision of Mr. Cromwell and his estate from the case had no bearing on the question. III. The act of April 5, 1858, authorizing the exclusive use of piers by certain specified lines of steamers and of steamboats plying between certain specified ports, has no application in this case; the defendants’ steamers do not come within the law, not being vessels enumerated in the act. (See Act April 5, 1858, Laws 1858, 413.) IV. The offers to show that other piers in the city have similar fences and obstructions upon them were properly rejected, as also the offer to show that the situation of pier Mo. 9 was such that only lighters could conveniently use the end of it. The evidence in each instance was wholly irrelevant and inadmissible. The state of the facts proposed to be proved did not limit- the operation of the law, or prevent its provisions from applying to the obstruction in question. V. The records of the hoard of commissioners of pilots were properly given in evidence to- show their official action on the subject. (Greenl. on Ev., § 483; Bissell v. Hamlin, 6 Duer, 512.) VI, It is matter of notoriety that the piers and wharves of th,e city of Hew York, are, to a great extent, appropriated, without right, by private parties, for the convenience of their own business, to the great detriment of the public interest. In the present action it was proved, to’ the satisfaction of the jury, that the defendants, the firm of H. B. Cromwell & Co., the agents of a leading line of steamers, had deliberately persisted, in spite of repeated notices and warning from the proper authorities, in keeping the obstruction complained of, upon the pier in question, solely for their private advantage, and so as to deprive all vessels, except those of their own line, and occasionally small lighters, of the use of the end of the pier. This persistent violation of law was properly rebuked by the verdict of the jury — and juries rarely give verdicts in suits for penalties except in very clear cases — and it being fully sustained by the evidence, their verdict should not be disturbed.',\n",

Testator owned a large rectangular piece of land fronting on A street and backing on B street with C street extending along one side of it from A to B streets. Some years before his death he built a fence across the tract about 240 feet back from A street, and divided the land between A street and the fence into several lots. He sold several of these lots from time to time describing them as fronting on A street, each with a depth of 240 feet from that street. At the time of his death he lived in a dwelling house on one of the lots. At that time he had not sold the land in the rear of the fence. By his will he gave the dwelling house with the ground thereto attached to his wife for life, and after her death he devised the same property to his daughter,' describing it as “ the lot of ground and the dwelling, the homestead situated on A street near C street.” He directed his executors to sell all of his estate not devised by his will, and to distribute the proceeds amongst his children. One of the executors petitioned the orphans’ court for an order to sell the land in the rear of the fence. The co-executor, the husband of the daughter to whom the homestead lot was devised, resisted the petition on the ground that his wife took not only the land between A street and the fence, but all in the rear of the fence of the width of the homestead lot. Held, (1) that the devise to the daughter included only the land from A street to the fence; (2) that the orphans’ court had jurisdiction to entertain the petition for the sale of the land.

       "  'case_summary': 'The Village of Itasca v. Ernest C. Schroeder. Opinion filed October 19, 1899. 1. Injunction—when injunction mil not be denied\\'on ground of remedy at law. An injunction suit against a municipality to restrain its officers from so changing a street as to encroach upon his property, necessitating the removal of his fences, the destruction of shade trees, and resulting in permanent damage to his lands, will not be denied on the ground of an adequate remedy at law. 2. Same—what a compliance with statute authorizing an injunction to issue without notice. It sufficiently appears that the rights of the complainant will be unduly prejudiced if an injunction is not issued immediately and without notice, under section 3 of the Injunction act, (Rev. Stat. 1874, p. 579,) when such fact is averred in the bill, and the complainant’s affidavit to the bill is positive, and not upon information and belief. 3. Evidence—location of monument in survey may be shown by extrinsic evidence. The location of an old bridge which is a monument in an old road survey may be established by extrinsic evidence in a controversy concerning the location of a road. 4. Appeals and errors—chancellor\\'s finding of fact from oral testimony is not lightly disturbed. A finding of the chancellor based on conflicting oral testimony will not be disturbed on appeal, as against the evidence, in the absence of clear and palpable error. 5. Municipal corporations—when a village is estopped to change location of street. A municipal corporation which has acquiesced for forty years in the location of a street, which it has worked and improved at various times, and in the making of permanent improvements with reference thereto by adjoining owners, is estopped from so changing its location as to encroach upon the grounds of an abutting property owner. 6. Same—an execution for, costs should not be a/warded against’a municipal corporation. An execution for costs should not be awarded against a municipal corporation upon the granting of an injunction restraining the corporate authorities from changing the location of a public street. Appeal from the Circuit Court of DuPage county; the Hon. Charles A. Bishop, Judge, presiding. This is a bill in chancery filed by Ernest 0. Schroeder, the appellee, in the circuit court of DuPage county, to the October term, 1897, of said court, praying for an injunction, against the village of Itasca, impleaded with William Wischsteadt, William Pieper and Edward Pfluger, to prevent them from moving the road-bed of Main street, in the village of Itasca, west fifteen or twenty feet onto the land of complainant. The village of Itasca was not incorporated as a village until March,\" 1890. The road in question was laid out and platted by the highway commissioners of the town of Addison on the 21st day of November, 1854, and is now known as Main street in the village of Itasca. The bill, as amended, alleges that complainant, Ernest C. Schroeder, is the lawful owner of the following described property, to-wit: Part of the north-east quarter of the south-west quarter of section 8, township 40, range 11, east of the third principal meridian, beginning at a stone at the north-west corner of the north-east quarter of the south-west quarter of section 8, township 40, north, range 11, east of the third principal meridian; thence south 87 degrees east 2.36 chains to the center of a road as laid out by H. Pierce, surveyor, November 21,1854, and accepted by the commissioners of highways of the town of Addison February 20, 1855; thence south 33£ degrees east along the center of said highway 9.55 chains; thence south 63i- degrees west 3.27 chains; thence south 14-J- degrees east 2.69 chains to the center of the Chicago and Elgin road; thence south 72£ degrees west in the center of said road 5.86 chains to the west line of said forty; thence north one degree east 13.55 chains along the said west line of said forty to the place of beginning, situated in the village of Itasca, DuPage county, Illinois; that he derived title to said premises from one Charles Pierce and wife on the fourth day of October, 1873; that he is now, and always has been since he first acquired title, in the quiet and peaceable occupation, possession and en joyment of the same; that said Pierce held title to the above described premises for many years prior to the date when said premises were conveyed to complainant, and that some time during the year 1854 said Pierce dedicated to the township of Addison, in DuPage county, a strip of land sixty-six feet wide, and adjoining the above described premises on the easterly line thereof, and commencing at a point in the center of Lester street, so called, thence north 33£ degrees west over the bridge across Meacham’s creek 20 chains to a post, said strip of land being now known as Main street, in the village of Itasca; that the west line of said Main street of sixty-six feet, as dedicated by said Pierce, has constituted, adjoins and is the easterly line of complainant’s property; that said line was marked by a fence, which was erected by said Pierce many years prior to the date when complainant acquired his title, in 1873, and that complainant has ever since that time maintained the said fences in good repair; that at the time when he took title to the said property said Pierce represented and told -him that the fence along the easterly line of said premises constituted the westerly line of said road, (now Main street,) and that if such line as marked out by the erection of said fence by Pierce was not the correct line according to the description in the dedication of said street, even then the public has, by lapse of time and non-user, lost all rights to whatever property may be within complainant’s enclosure; that he has maintained quiet and peaceable enjoyment of the above described premises, and has been in possession of the same from the date he received thé title thereto, to the exclusion of all people, and that his lines, as established by his said fences enclosing said premises for the last forty years, were never questioned or disputed by any one; that on or about the 20th day of August, 1897, the trustees of the village of Itasca employed certain surveyors for the pretended purpose of locating said Main street, as dedicated by Pierce to the township of Addison, in the year 1854; that said surveyors located the street ten or fifteen feet further west than where the said street has been located for the past forty years or more, and thereby encroaching to that extent upon complainant’s property; that certain trustees of the village of Itasca and certain persons named as defendants are changing the road-bed so as to conform with said recent survey, and are removing the sidewalk on the easterly line of said Main street as established by the dedication of Pierce, and are re-building the same much .nearer to complainant’s property, and are about to enter upon complainant’s property, and will remove his fences, plow up his field and cut standing trees, and permanently damage complainant’s said lands; that certain members of the village board of Itasca have made threats that they will remove or cause the removal of the fence constituting the easterly line of the said property; that he planted a row of trees, forty or more in number, along the line of his property on the east, which have since grown up to large and magnificent trees, beautifying and greatly adding to the value of his property, and that if the proposed change of the street as contemplated and now in progress of being\\' carried out is made, said trees will have to be cut down and removed, which will be a large and irreparable injury to complainant; that according to the old original lines of said street the property owners on the east side of Main street have encroached upon said street from six to twelve feet, and if said street is to be widened or changed the property owners on the east side of said street ought in equity and good conscience to be the ones to surrender said property to said village, and not an innocent person who has not encroached upon the public right nor intends to do so; that complainant’s rights in the premises will be unduly prejudiced, and he will be subjected to great damages and loss, if the \"injunction is not issued immediately and without notice to the said defendants; prays for an injunction restraining and enjoining defendants from changing the road-bed of said Main street and also from changing complainant’s easterly line. Defendants filed their answer, in which they deny that Charles Pierce dedicated, at any time, a strip of land to the township of Addison, which is now Main street, in the village of Itasca; aver that in 1854 the proper authorities, of the said township laid out, in due form of law, a street in said village of Itasca, now known as Main street, and which said street lies east of certain premises of complainant; deny that the easterly line of complainant’s premises was marked by a fence which was erected by said Pierce many years prior to the date when complainant acquired title, in 1873; deny that complainant has ever since maintained said fences in good repair, or otherwise; aver that complainant has, during the past twelve years, been encroaching upon the public highway known as Main street, which was duly laid out by the authorities of the township of Addison; that said road was laid out before the said village of Itasca was incorporated; that complainant has on several occasions within the past fifteen years moved his fences forward, in an easterly direction, a large number of feet upon said highway; admit they employed surveyors for the purpose of fixing the line of Main street, who found the fences of complainant ten or fifteen feet east of where they ought to be; deny they located the street ten or fifteen feet further west than where the road has been located for the past forty years; deny that by reason of non-user the public lost its right in the property; deny complainant is entitled to relief in a court of equity. A cross-bill was filed by the village of Itasca and an answer by Ernest 0. Schroeder. There was a replication to the answer to the cross-bill, and the cause was heard on pleadings and proof. The court, on the hearing, found the equities of the case to be with complainant, and dismissed the cross-bill for want of equity and entered a decree making the injunction perpetual. To reverse this decree the defendants have appealed to this court. J. H. Batten, and J. F. Snyder, for appellant. Fred A. Rathje, and Botsford, Wayne & Bots-ford, for appellee: Equity, on a proper showing, will enjoin a threatened trespass. 1 High on Injunctions, (3d ed.) sec. 702, p. 542. Where a city undertakes, under color of its charter powers, to take possession of land to which it has no right, on the pretense that it has been dedicated as a public street, thereby inflicting on the owner a permanent and continuing injury, the proper remedy is by injunction.

       "  'case_summary': \"Andrew Johnson v. John Hannahan and J. J. Hannahan. The amount of damages, a matter wherein no exact rule can be applied, must necessarily be left to the jury, with proper admonitions concerning their duty to regard the evidence, and to regulate their discretion by a just view of all the circumstances. If the Court perceives no error in law, although the case had been sent back for a new trial, on the ground of excessive damages, a second verdict, higher than the first, ought to stand, upon the principle expedid ut sit finis htium. The fact that the jury, after being properly instructed, as to their right to sever, in estimating damages against co-defendants in trespass, returned a verdict in which no distinction was made between them, shews that the Circuit Judge properly exercised his discretion in refusing to allow the case of either to be separately submitted to their consideration. If the boundary line, between adjoining proprietors, runs along the centre of a ditch, neither party is, ofcowrse, entitled to re-open more titan that half of the ditch which is on his own side of the line. If a right exists to re-open a boundary ditch, from which the dirt had been originally thrown, part of its length, on the land of one proprietor, and the other part on that of the adj oining proprietor, the party exercising this right is bound to throw the dirt as it had been originally thrown. The unnecessary stepping upon another man’s soil, is, under ordinary circumstances, a trifle which the law would disregard; yet, where tire motive is bad, and matters of aggravation have attended the entry, the least entry is a trespass; and any trespass having been established, the matters of aggravation may be shewn to enhance the damages. l Strob. 313. Before Wardlaw, J. at Charleston, May Term, 1848. In this action of trespass quare clausum fregit, the plaintiff sought to recover damages for an invasion of his close, accompanied, as he alleged, by circumstances of oppression and insult. The report of a former trial of the case may be referred to for a general outline of its main features, as they now appeared. Plaintiff’s counsel offered to read the former report as part of the record — refused; held former report of the Judge, and opinions, especially dissenting opinion, no part of the record; they may be referred to only as authority, like opinions in any other case. Under the evidence, as it now appeared, the jury were not told that the ditch, through the garden, must necessarily be taken as the boundary between the parties, but various views were presented, according to the facts, as they might be found by the jury. The public road ran north and south ; west of it was the church, and also the corner, from which the line between the two tracts of land ran towards the east: Jenkins’s tract (of which plaintiff held part) being north of the line, and the defendants’s tract (formerly Murray’s) south of the line. That line had long ago been marked by a ditch, which (although it was slightly deflected between the road and the plaintiff’s enclosure, so as to trench on the land of Jenkins,) was straight through the garden, and may be considered to have been straight in its whole extent; and just in the middle of its three feet width, to have coincided exactly (as Mr. Pinckney said it did,) with the mathematical line between the two tracts, shewn by the paper titles. The bank of that ditch, for the first half of its length, (including the part within the plaintiff’s enclosure,) had been thrown to the south on Murray’s land — for the other half, it had been thrown to the north on Jenkins’s land ; and the fence had been put upon the bank, having crossed the ditch at the middle of its length. There liad fen qlertriugs and cultivation, on both sides of the fence, in many pl&cgs, and the proprietors had, for more than twenty.yearsjjbefpíe Johnson went in, held, each, up to the fence, keepingmfnílíe fence by common contribution. Before Jenkins put Johnson in, the small piece which he allowed John-soil-''to’o.ccupj had been in woods, within the same enclosure as cultivated fields close by ; and the old worm fence having been burnt down, a straight fence was put up, by Johnson, around his enclosure, which, in front, was on the bank, along the line of the old fence, which Jenkins had claimed and pointed out as his boundary. In this straight fence there, was a recess with a gate at the bottom of a small curve, so that the gate which led from the plaintiff’s bouse to the private road, on the defendants’s land, stood a few feet north of the old ditch, and the panels of fence, leading from the fence, on the bank, to the gate, as well as the side fences of the plaintiff, crossed the old ditch. Division lines on the island, where this close was, were generally marked by a ditch and bank, and there were four modes of adjusting these : 1. There were two ditches with a bank between, in which case the mathematical line was along the middle of the bank. 2. A ditch on one tract, a bank on' the other, straight throughout the line, in which case the margin of the ditch, next the bank, was on the exact line. 3. A ditch was dug so that, for half the line, the southern margin was the exact line, the bank being on the south; then an offset was made in the ditch so as to make the northern margin a prolongation of the line, and the bank was thrown on the north. 4. A ditch was dug straight the whole way, so that the line was in its middle, and the bank was thrown, for half way, on one side, and for the other half on the other. In every case a common fence, where there was a ditch, was on the bank, and was kept up, according to some understanding, by the party on whose land the portion of fence was, or by common contribution. The plaintiff, in this case, made points as to license and fraud, which were overruled; but it was held that if the jury should find that this division line had been originally marked according to the fourth of the modes above mentioned, and that the proprietors, on the two sides, had held, according to the fences on the banks, for more than twenty years, before Jenkins permitted Johnson to come in, then, that Johnson had either a right to the land up to the fence, or had a right, beyond the ditch, to keep up his fence on his neghbor’s land.’ The latter right might be only an easement, for injury to which, case would be the appropriate remedy; former one was a right in the soil, for injury pass would lie, and was the right which exia should find that, after the digging of the dita| of the fences on the banks, the proprietors haj claim of right in the soil, up to the fence oil with an understanding that the banks shq boundary. If there had not been such claim of right _ ing, perfected by time, as would give any right in beyond the original line, the ditch should, then, be regarded as the boundary; and although the fences may have been on the banks, by common labor, for mutual convenience, there was a right, in either proprietor, to open the ditch which wag boundary. But the right to enter, for the purpose of opening a boundary ditch in a garden, was an extreme right which should be exercised with the greatest caution, and carried with it no right to do, to the neighbor’s land, any injury not essential to the execution of the principal purpose. Therefore, if the ditch could have been opened without unreasonable difficulty, and yet neither the panels of side fences, the panels in the curve at the gate, nor the gate posts, have been removed, the removal of either of these, or any other unnecessary injury, done to the soil of the plaintiff, was a trespass. Either of the trespasses last supposed, it was held, might apply to the younger Hannahan, if he, in any way, encouraged or aided it. And in relation to him and to the motion for non-suit, it was further held that, however the defendants might have had a right to re-open the ditch, it was a trespass in either of them, if, by his directions, any dirt had been thrown on the plaintiff’s side of the ditch, or if he had unnecessarily stepped upon the plaintiff’s land. Hill and Miss Willard both spoke of dirt thrown on both sides of the ditch, and Hill said that the younger Hannahan had gone upon the plaintiff’s side of the ditch, when he kicked Bates, and that the elder Hannahan had gone into the piazza. His Honor observed that, as to the damages which should be rendered for insult and matter of aggravation, there could be no pecuniary standard, but he endeavored to induce just moderation, in the jury, in the exercise of a sound discretion. The verdict was for the plaintiff, against both defendants, $3000. His Honor said he thought it high, but that ho did not know what was the state of the case which the jury found to present the truth. The defendants appealed, and moved the Court of Appeals to set aside the verdict, on the grounds : 1st. That there was not a tittle of evidence implicating the defendant, John J. Hannahan, with his co-defendant, in any joint trespass upon the plaintiff’s close, and, therefore, the motion for a non-suit, made on behalf of John J. Hannahan, ought to have been granted. 2d. That John J. Hannahan was manifestly made a party to this action, merely to deprive his co-defendant of the benefit of his evidence, and, therefore, his Honor ought to have acceded to an application which was made, either to submit the case against John J. Hannahan to the jury, when the plaintiff’s evidence was closed, or to permit him to be sworn as a witness on behalf of his co-defendant. 3d. That his Honor erred in charging that the evidence of Mr. Pinckney was not conclusive to establish that the ditch was the boundary line, between the defendant, John Hanna-han, and the party under whom the plaintiff claimed, when it clearly appeared that he was mutually chosen to ascertain the line between them. 4th. That his Honor further erred in charging, that even if the ditch was the boundary line, and the defendant might be entitled to clear out or re-open the ditch, yet he had. no right to remove the fence, unless it were absolutely necessary, and if so the action would lie; whereas it is submitted that the plaintiff’s remedy, for such an injury, would be by action on the case, and that the present action could not be maintained. 5th. That his Honor further erred in instructing the jury, that their discretion, as to the amount of the verdict, was altogether without limit or control; whereas, it is respectfully submitted that the jury are, by law, limited, in their amount of verdict, to a fair estimate of the injury done to the plaintiff, whether to his freehold or other property, his person, or his feelings. 6th. That the amount of the, verdict is wholly unwarranted by the evidence, or the rules of law, and is, in fact, so excessive as to render the laws of property nugatory. 7th. That the verdict against John J. Hannahan is entirely unsupported by the evidence, and as to him, at least, should be set aside. 8th. That the verdict is, in other respects, contrary to law and the evidence. ARGUMENT. Hunt, for the motion. This was undoubtedly a speculative suit to mulct a man, who was a land holder, for doing what he believed to be the exercise of a right undoubtedly belonging to him. That such suits ought not to be encouraged, must be admitted; there was no actual damage amounting to twenty dollars, by the highest estimate.— But the suit was based upon a claim for damages for what is termed insult, and words not actionable in themselves ; and the alleged trespass was to evade the law, and getting a purely nominal trespass, to graft on it an unlimited claim for vindictive damages. In the former trial, set aside by the Appeal Court, for a clear error in law, it was laid down as good law, that if a party enters on a lawful errand, and a new and distinct trespass, although in itself triffling, is committed, it reflects back on the original entry, and renders the party what was styled a trespasser ab initio. This was shewn to be a pure misap prehension of the law. For unless the subsequent wrong reflects back, and proves the first entry was not bona fide, so absurd a doctrine could never be maintained. This is at the foundation of this case. The testimony proves, beyond a doubt, that the entry was for a lawful purpose. Both parties met and parted amicably in the forenoon, and in the afternoon a quarrel, not in the least affecting the opening of the ditch, arose between Mr. Hannahan and a mere stranger, on Mr. Hannah an’s own land. Admit all the plaintiff’s case, and hut for this altercation no cause of action would have existed. The complaint was that pending this personal quarrel, the defendant pursued this stranger, who ran through Mr. Johnson’s house after abusing defendant.— Now, at the opening of Mr. H’s. own ditch, on his own land, even if any dirt was thrown out, or any palings were removed from the defendants’s own land, there was no cause of action in trespass quare clausum firegit — for there was no entry at all on plaintiff’s close, until afte,r the ditch was dug ; the survey after by Mr. Pinckney, and the acquiescence even now, in the ditch and line as opened, is conclusive. If the Appeal Court were light, then, in. ruling that each event was distinct, the alleged trespass .was no foundation for the verdict. As to the afternoon’s affair, it lasted but a few minutes — some Irish laborers chased an Englishman who cursed them; he fled, and was pursued by them. Mr. Hannahan, it is admitted, called them to come away from the house— they did so ; and for this the outrageous sum of $3000 was awarded. The monstrous inequality between a momentary invasion, accompanied by not a loss of a cent, must strike every one. Such verdicts are a premium to the worst species of gambling in the law. The Court is bound to exercise a wholesome control over the passions and prejudices of juries. It is said this is a second trial, but the first was admitted to have been unjust, as the innocent and rightful act of marking one’s own line was coupled with a distinct of-fence. The charge of the Judge being so very alternative, that, as usual, he says he thought the verdict high, but does not know what state of the case the jury thought presented the truth. But this Court ought to know, that what the jury acted on was the truth. They doubtless reversed the former decision, and did treat it as a case of trespass ah initio, and thus nullified the law, and repeated the absurdity of making a man a trespasser for exercising an undoubted act of ownership. And the Court is bound, as well as the jury, to see a state of facts justifying this enormous transfer of one man’s property to the pockets of another. To encourage this liberty of a jury to disregard settled law, is to give up the control of the Appeal Court to the arbitrary, or, perhaps, revengeful feelings of a temporary tribunal. It was the duty of the Court, instead of presenting so many “ ifs” to them, to have stated, distinctly, that the entry was lawful, and had been so> ruled, and then a new trial would have been due to justice. To make a verdict, set aside as illegal, a precedent to control the discretion of this Court, in enforcing even-handed justice, will be to give up one of their chief prerogatives, and bring justice to the contempt due only to a gambling shop. Two verdicts are no better than one, if the first was given under a wrong charge ; and for this Court to yield its own views, upon the allegation that there is no proportion between a wrong and the amount of damages, is not founded in good sense. That the only wrong complained of was not premed-ited, but arose on a sudden affray, was soon over, and no pecuniary loss, and an ample apology instantly offered, all combine to demand of this Court to resolve the ifs of the charge, to state the law as it is on any view of the testimony; and my client trusts that, if the Court is weary of his case, they will do him the justice to say he never sought a law suit, but freely offerred to submit the whole to honorable and discreet friends.

Appeal from Logan Circuit Court, Southern District; James Cochran, Judge; modified and affirmed. STATEMENT OF FACTS. The parties to this litigation are coterminous proprietors of tracts of land which are made irregular in shape by Booneville creek, a tortuous stream running through the land, or, rather, forming the boundary of both tracts. Both parties deraign their title from one James Boss, who at one time owned the land on both sides of the creek at the point in controversy. Boss sold the land east of the creek to one J. P. Henderson and this is the land owned by appellee Thomas at the time of the institution of this suit; his father (from whom he had title by descent) having acquired the title by mesne conveyances from Henderson.' Boss died, but his son and heir disposed of all the land west of the creek except a twenty-two-acre tract, which he sold and conveyed to one Sweeney, who conveyed to Bruer, who conveyed to appellant Parks. These deeds described the land by reference to Booneville creek. Appellee brought this suit to recover damages, both compensatory and punitive, to compensate the alleged unlawful and malicious trespasses committed by appellant on the land of appellee. The complaint contained two counts. In the first count it was alleged that appellant, by force of arms, had broken and entered appellee’s close, and had wilfully, wantonly and unlawfully cut down and destroyed appellee’s post and wire fence there situated and had injured and damaged appellee’s grass, herbage and soil. In the second count it was alleged that appellant had wilfully, wantonly and unlawfully broken and entered appellee’s close and had taken and carried away appellee’s soil, sand, earth, rock and gravel and had converted the same to his own use. There was a prayer in each count for damages both compensatory and punitive. The answer specifically denied the allegations of both counts of the complaint, and further alleged that “in 1871 J. P. Henderson sold to-Boss, the land now owned by the defendant, and that the said J. P. Henderson, who owned the land now owned by the plaintiff and-Ross, had an agreement about the line between their land, and that the said J. P. Henderson built his fence enclosing his land on the west side on the bank of the creek where the fence is now standing, and that the-Ross joined his fence enclosing the land now owned by the defendant to the J. P. Henderson fence as it is at this time. That said fencing has been standing as it is at this time for the past forty years; that defendant and his assignees have had peaceable, open, adverse possession against the plaintiff and his assignees for the past forty years, paid the taxes thereon and have continuously exercised ownership over same for the said time of about forty years. “Defendant further states that the gravel bed is west of the creek, near the'ford, on defendant’s land, and that defendant and his assignees have continuously exercised ownership over said gravel bed for the past forty years or thereabout. ’ ’ There was a verdict for appellee on the first count for $300 and on the second count for $200, and this appeal has been prosecuted to reverse the judgment rendered for the sum total of the two verdicts. The court instructed the jury that appellee was entitled to recover compensatory damages on the first count, and under instructions, which are not questioned, submitted the right to recover compensatory damages under the second count, and gave instructions declaring the conditions under which punitive damages might also be assessed on either or both counts. As grounds for reversal of the judgment, it is chiefly insisted that the court erred in directing a verdict on the first count, and in submitting the question of punitive damages on either count. Other errors are assigned which will be discussed in the opinion; while other assignments of error need not be discussed, as they relate to the punitive damages, which question we have disposed of upon the grounds stated in the opinion. A. 8. McKennon and Kincavknon & Kmccmnon, for appellant. 1. It was error to direct a verdict on the first count and in submitting the question of punitive damages to the jury under either count. The testimony shows conclusively that the gravel bed was on the west side of the creek when Dr. Thomas purchased the land for plaintiff. The testimony fails to justify a verdict for any punitive or exemplary damages under either count. 104 Ark. 89. The verdict is excessive. The rental value of the land was shown to be $8 and the value of the gravel $37, a total of $45, while the verdict was for $300 as compensatory damages, which is excessive. The measure of damages where property is unlawfully taken is the value of the property taken. 126 Ark. 554; 101 Id. 34; 85 Id. 111. The verdict fixes a specific sum as damages and is grossly excessive as compensatory damages, without any intimation whatever that the jury found any ground for punitive damages, defendant was entitled to know whether he was required only to pay plaintiff reasonable compensation in money, the actual damage to the gravel bed and to his property by his act of tearing down the fénce and depriving plaintiff of the use of his pasture. It was the duty of the jury to observe and follow the instructions of the court. It is evident that punitive damages were allowed, for which the judgment should be reversed. Cases supra. 2. There were errors in admitting the testimony and in counsel’s statement in opening the case that “one Mrs. Gray, a poor widow, had her cow in the pasture and that defendant turned it out,” etc. Mrs. Gray was not a party to the suit and testimony to sustain this statement would be wholly irrelevant; it could prove no issue and was calculated to prejudice the minds of the mry and clearly erroneous. 87 Ark. 461; 12 A. & E. Enc. PI. & Pr. 727; Thompson on Trials, § 963. • Bryan Thomas was permitted to testify that on sale of the land the purchaser reserved $500. of the purchase money. This was too remote and could not bind or affect defendant, nor establish any issue. Also C. M. Roberts was permitted to testify that he purchased plaintiff’s land and reserved $500 of the purchase price because of this suit. This was not an element of damage and could not be considered for any purpose. Plaintiff’s counsel was permitted to ask Mrs. Gray about pasturing her cow with defendant and what she had paid him. H. Sweeney was allowed to testify that he did not buy or claim the gravel bed nor buy nor claim any ground across the creek from the west; that he did not buy or claim or take into possession any ground adjacent to his land on this side of the creek or claim anything on this, the west side, of the creek. As defendant deraigns title through Sweeney this was prejudicial error. Defendant also offered to prove that he had sold gravel from the bed; that Hiram Tatum, then in control of plaintiff’s property and acting for plaintiff’s guardian, objected to money being paid to defendant for gravel. That afterwards in conversation with defendant he withdrew said objections, stating that he believed that said gravel bed belonged to defendant and would make no further objections to defendant’s use of it. This was objected to by plaintiff and the court erred in sustaining the objection. Counsel for plaintiff was permitted to ask plaintiff on the stand as a witness, “You claim to be a law-abiding man. If you are, why did you with strong hand tear down this property and not resort to the courts?” Defendant excepted to the ruling of the court. It was vexatious and disrespectful, and its purpose to bring defendant into disrespect before the jury. It was error by peremptory instruction to direct a verdict on the first count. 98 Ark. 334; lb. 370'; 105 Id. 136; 61 Id. 429; 131 Id. 153; lb. 197; Warville on Abstracts of Title, 53-4, 314; 131 Ark. 197.

       "  'case_summary': 'CharlestoN, January Term, 18Í3. William Heyward vs. Thomas Bennet. Desausure, Plaintiff’s attorney. Pringle, Defendant’s att’iji Trespass to try title. This was an action of trespass to try title to acres of marsh land on James’ Island. Title being the issue, there was no question about the trespass. The plaintiff attempted to deduce his title from Samuel Stobo, but in tracing the title up to the original grant, which was to one Mary Patty, on the first of July, 1683, it appeared very manifestly, and so the court stated to the jury, that the grant did not cover the marsh, but expressly called for it as a boundary. The plaintiff then set up a claim by possession, which it was said commenced’anterior to the 4th July, 1776, and, therefore, would consummate his right under a special clause in an act of the legislature, notwithstanding the recognized principle of nullum tempus occurret Peipublicce. Upon the point of possession, the evidence on both sides was vast, and the one contradictory of the other. The plaintiff’s witnesses deposed, i that Mr. Heyward’s father had kept the marsh enclosed by running a fence so far into it as to exclude the neighbors’ cattle, and that the mai’sh so enclosed served him for pasture; (but all agreed that the cattle could only feed upon a hard margin in the marsh of 15 or 20 feet$) that he had occasionally used Coxe’s creek, which flowed through the marsh for navigation of his market boats to a landing from which he sometimes sent vegetables to market, hut it appeared in evidence, that the landing could only be resorted to at a certain pitch of the tide, was in a sequestered situation, and that Mr. Heyward, generally used for marketing the landing at Dill’s Bluff, where he built houses for his boats, being on a creek which afforded a better navigation to the market than Coxe’s. A witness on the part of the plaintiff deposed, that a hammock in the marsh had been cleared by plaintiff’s father for the purpose of establishing an orange garden, but that it had never been planted, nor was the garden further attempted, and that he had sometimes used the sedge from the marsh fronting his house as manure. The defendant produced a grant of the marsh, dated and it was in evidence, that the plaintiff, since the date of the defendant’s grant, had obtained a grant of part of the marsh claimed under Stobo’s conveyance. The defendant’s witness positively swore that Mr. Heyward, the father, had never enclosed the marsh till within a recent date, but that it had been used indiscriminately as a common, so much at least as was fit for that purpose, by the cattle of the neighborhood; that the fence which enclosed Mr. Heyward’s field did not run into the marsh, but parallel with it, in proof whereof, trees of considerable growth (a fact not denied) between where the fence was said to have stood and the marsh, are now to be seen, which plainly delineates the course of the fence. That they never knew Coxe’s creek used by Mr. Hey-ward for his market boats; but they have frequent. ly, nay almost constantly, seen his boats going up and down Dill’s creek. . principal witness of the plaintiff who had been an overseer to the plaintiff’s father, also confessed he did not recollect that Coxe’s creek had been used by Mr. Heyward. The defendant’s witnesses outnumbered the witnesses of the plaintiff, and had equal opportunities with those of the latter most relied on for being acquainted with the facts to which they deposed. Upon this evidence, the court, after the pleadings had been concluded, charged the jury, that the plaintiff had failed in the deduction of his title ; that the deed, unsupported by the grant, could be regarded as a circumstance only to shew the commencement of the possession. That it shewed Mr. Heyward, the father, had taken possession of the marsh; that the jury, from long use might presume a grant, but here that presumption could not avail, as it was rebutted ; that the plaintiff could only support his claim by possession anterior to the 4th July, 1776, under the clause of the act of 1787 ; that under this act his right could not be shaken, that Strain’s evidence was so decisive of possession that it was impossible not to believe the plaintiff’s right consummated, for he had lived with the plaintiff as an overseer from ’65 to ’71; that Yates had declared the fence run into the marsh in ’76 ; that the defendant’s witness confirmed that fact; Todd and Hivers having said there was the appearance of an old fence; that Mr. Heyward had also used the j anding on Coxis creek, another proof of the occupation of the marsh ; that it rested with the jury to say who was mistaken. Mair had been an overseer ; that numbers were not the criterion by which to weigh testimony, but the opportunities which the witnesses had of obtaining correct knowledge; that the defendant’s grant was óut of the question j it had no seal and the judges had determined that a grant without a seal was void. The jury retired and returned with a verdict for the plaintiff for the whole land in dispute. A title by possession under the hot of 1787 must be an ac-tualpeaceable possession, such as is notice to all the world. On the part of the defendant, a new trial is moved in this case on the following grounds. 1st, That the plaintiff could not shew any right of title in him to the premises in question, and of this opinion was his honour the judge who presided at the trial. 2nd, That the premises in question, never were granted to the original grantees under whom the plaintiff claimed and endeavoured to deduce the title. 3rd, That the premises never having been originally granted, the plaintiff could only claim by possession anterior to the 4th July, 1776, agreeably to the act of the Legislature in such cases made and provided. 4th, That the plaintiff not having in him a right of title, hut setting up a bare right of possession, it was legally incumbent on him to support such possession by the strictest proof. 5th, That the evidence adduced in support of _ . . . r. such possession, was»insufficient to vest m him a right to the premises in question. 6th, That the verdict was contrary to law and evidence, because the fence said to be an enclosure,, supposing it proved, was not of itself sufficient to establish a right by possession ; and the use set up, (if proved,) was of a very small proportion of the property; namely, the margin of the marsh, a temporary use of the hammock in the marsh which was afterwards abandoned, the plaintiff’s ancestor having only cleared, but never cultivated it, which could not give a right to the premises or body of the marsh. 7th, That it is presumed on the part of the defendant, that his honour the judge mistook instating the evidence of Yates, one of the witnesses, in the following particular; that he saw the plaintiff in 1776 in the marsh, instead of 1796; and the testimony of jRivers as to seeing the remains of an ancient fence, as he only spoke of rails washed up by the tide. That the verdict was, in other respects, against evidence.',\n",

Street — Prescription.—A street across certain lands exists by prescription where a plat showing the existence of such street, made by the sheriff and duly recorded, has been in existence for twenty-five years, and such plat has been recognized by the owners of the land, and the city has worked such street, and, ten years before suit, permitted a street railway company to lay its track and operate its cars thereon, and has allowed a telephone company to erect its poles thereon. Same — Acceptance by Ordinance. — The statute providing that no street dedicated to public use by the proprietor of ground in any city shall be deemed a public street unless the dedication shall be accepted by ordinance (Sand. & H. Dig., sec. 5209,) has no application to a street established by prescription. Same — Establishment by Prescription — Evidence.—It requires less proof to establish a street by prescription across certain land where such street serves to unite the disconnected ends of two established streets than where the street claimed runs diagonally across a block. Appeal from Pulaski Chancery Court. David W. Carrorr, Chancellor. STATEMENT BY THE COURT. This is a controversy concerning the right of the city of Little Rock to control and keep open a street across a piece of land claimed by appellant, Waring. The suit was brought by Waring to enjoin the city from interfering with his possession of such land. The city claimed that Eighth street extends across said laud, and that it has been established across said land both by dedication and prescription. The land was at one time owned by Mrs. Matilda Johnson. In the year 1868, Edwin H. Hilliard recovered a judgment against said Matilda Johnson. An execution was issued thereon, and the sheriff levied the same upon a tract of land belonging to Mrs. Johnson, containing six acres. The land in controversy lay adjoining the land levied upon, but had been previously transferred by Mrs. Johnson to A. H. Sevier. Before selling the land levied upon, the sheriff divided it into lots and streets, and platted the same, with other land adjoining it, as “Johnson’s Addition.” The land in controversy was a part of the tract owned by- Sevier, and was included in the plat of said addition made and recorded by the sheriff. The plat of said addition showed Eighth or Holly street as extended across the land in controversy. This plat of Johnson’s addition was filed for record on the 9th of December, 1868. There is nothing to show that the sheriff had authority to make and record this plat, but, after the same was made, the owners of land included therein described such property in all subsequent conveyances thereof as in Johnson’s addition to the city of Bittle Rock. Waring and Eletcher, from whom Waring purchased the land, testified on the trial that the land had never been used as a street by the public; that the travel was not over it, but diagonally across the adjoining lots; that the city had done no work on the property, nor repaired it as a street. Eletcher also testified that, about a year after the street railway had been built, he served notice on the president of the company that the company had built on his property, and the president, for the company, recognized his rights, and promised not to plead the statute of limitations. On behalf of the city, J. N. Jabine testified as follows: “I have known Eighth street since 1861. It was an open street at that time, to the best of my recollection. It has been used as a street continuously since. I never heard of any dispute about it being eu street until this suit was brought. East and west of the property in controversy the houses and fences are all built evenly with reference to Eighth street being a regular street. * * * * * The street railroad threw up a track in the center of Eighth street, and injured the travel very much, but the people could and did travel it on either side of the dump. Before the track was built, there was, I suppose as much travel there as on any of the out streets, with the exception of Ninth street. I sometimes rode over Eighth street in the street cars, and sometimes walked over it. I live two blocks from the property in controversy. So far as I know, this street has been used continuously since 1861.” John E. Geyer, who stated that he lived near the property in controversy, testified for the city as follows: ‘T have known\\'Eighth street, as projected through or by the property in controversy, about twenty-one years. I bought the property that I live on now about that time, and Eighth street was a street then. It was a street then through the property in controversy. Prior to the time the street railway threw up their levee or dump on Eighth street, it was as good as three-fourths of the streets in the city, and it was used as a public street by wood wagons, buggies, and other wagons. There was not much travel over it. I never heard of any objection to its being used as a street until today, as I thought Mr. \"Waring was suing for damages for the dump being put and left there. I have heard Mr. Jabine’s testimony read. The statements made by him in reference to the fences and buildings, condition, and travel of the street for the last fifteen years are true, and I adopt it as my deposition.” The testimony of W. D. Holtzman was substantially the same as that of Jabine and Geyer. He also testified that, ‘‘before the street railway was built, Eighth street over \\'the property in controversy was worked by the city as much as other streets. The ditches were cleaned out, and property drained. It was not done often, as not much work was done on the streets.” The following facts were also proved : About the year 1882, the city, by an ordinance, permitted a street railway company to build a street railway over this property, as part of Eighth street. The cars of the company were run over it regularly for several years, until the track was changed to Ninth street. A telephone company was permitted to erect its poles along Eighth street without the consent of either Waring or his grantor. H. L. Fletcher, the grantor of Waring, in the year 1887, made application to the city council to be paid for the use of this property by the city, stating that the city had taken possession of it. Appellant, Waring, afterwards, in 1891, made a similar application to be paid for the use of the property by the city. The city paid them nothing, and in no way recognized their right to obstruct the street. The other facts sufficiently appear in the opinion. The chancellor dismissed the complaint of appellant for want of equity. Marshall & Coffman, for appellant. Appellant shows a chain of title from the U. S. government, and an appropriation for public use as a street must be shown by a clear preponderance of the testimony to have been done in some of the modes known to the law. There was no express dedication of the land. The plat filed by the sheriff was abortive as to lands lying west of those sold by him, in the suit, as to those who were not parties, and who never joined in or assented to its execution,. but always asserted rights antagonistic to it. Land can only be dedicated by its owner. 42 Ark. 66; 22 Pac. 623; 29 Kas. 28. Nor has there been any implied dedication by conduct of the owners amounting to an estoppel. In such case the intent to yield the land to public use must be clear and unequivocal. Dill. Mun. Corp., sec..495; 5 Am. & Eñg. Enc. Law, 400; 59 Ark. 26. The use by the public in this case was permissive only. 29 Atl. 370; 58 Am. Dec. 610; 60 id. 407; 9 Am. & Eng. Enc. Law, 367; Ell., Roads, etc. 93, 126; 59 Ark. 35; 39 Am. Dec. 754. In 59 Ark. 26, and 47 id. 431, there were unmistakable acts of the owner and the public authorities, tending to show dedication and adverse user, and even these were not held conclusive. Here nothing was done by the city, except perhaps to drain off the water at rare intervals. Knowledge of work or travel by the owners is essential to proof of intent to dedicate. Elliott, Roads and Streets, 126; 41 N. J. Eq. 489; 58 Iowa, 567. The public travel and work may be perfectly consistent with the rights of the owner. The travel was not confined to any particular route, and is not shown to have been confined to the so-called street at all. There are no circumstances to show that the use was not merely permissive. 24 Am. & Eng. Enc. Law, 10, 11 and notes; 5 id. 409. Even if this land, or any part of it, has been dedicated by estoppel or otherwise, it is still but a private way, to be insisted on only by those who have acquired rights, unless the city has, in the manner required by law, adopted it as a public street and highway. Without this she cannot protect it by any civil or criminal proceedure. 24 Am. & Eng. Enc. Law 11, 12; Dill. Mun. Corp., 505, and notes; 5 Strobh. (S. C.) 217; 58 Ark. 142; 47 Ark. 431; 31 Pac. 338; 3 Pick. 408; 9 Bush, 61; 8 Gratt. 632. When there is a statutory requirement, it is exclusive. 5 Am. & Eng. Enc. Law, 414; Elliott, Roads and Streets, 118. Slight and unequivocal acts are not sufficient. Id. 115, 116; 15 N. E. 854; 17 id. 43; 65 Mich. 241. The street must be accepted. Gantt’s Dig., sec. 3210; Mansf. Dig., sec. 738; 58 Ark. 142; 44 id. 537. The act of 1873 does not apply, for these lands were not decided, — at least those west of Perry street. 58 Ark. 142; 44 id. 537. The city’s claim by prescription is untenable, because (1) such right can only grow out of adverse user in a well defined line of travel for the statutory period, under claim of right with knowledge of the owner or circumstances of notoriety. 44 Ark. 537; 50 id. 53; 47 id. 66; 1 Am. & Eng. Enc. Law, 264; 9 id. 366-9; 19 id. 12, 15, 23, and notes. And (2) a mere user by private individuals, who have no authority or desire to bind the city, but simply act upon their own choice, however long, can never start the statute. Cases su-prcr, 35 Kas. 717; 55 Atl. 618; Angelí, Highways (3 Ed.), 151. In those casés where prescription was sustained, there was work done or some distinct recognition by public authorities. 83 Am. Dec. 264; 110 Ind. 509; Elliott, Roads, etc. 137, and note; 19 Atl. 1051; 30 Pac. 64; 17 S. W. 520. And the assertion of their rights by the owner defeats the prescription. 19 Am. & Eng. Enc. Law, 22, and note; 10 L. R. Á. 484, and note; 59 Ark. 35. The reference to Eighth street in Fletcher’s deed would create an estoppel between the parties, but does not inure to the benefit of others, or of the city. As to them, it is no more than a reference to a brook or other natural object. 63 Mich. 165; 12 Atl. 664; 16 id. 631, 59 Ark. 12; 25 Pac. 673; 29 N. E. 274. J. W. Blackwood, City Attorney, for appellee. The proof shows that this property has been used as a public thoroughfare for thirty years. All the city maps for twenty years show it as Eighth street. Houses and fences are built with reference to it as a street. Fletcher’s deed to appellant describes it as bounded north by Eighth street “and 150 on Eighth street.” In 1868 it was platted and recorded, and shows Eighth street extended through this property, 6o feet wide. It was labelled “Johnson’s Addition.” Itis true there was no bill of assurances, but all these facts show a common law dedication, and a grant or prescription will be presumed. Broom’s Leg. Max., p. 729; Mech. Pub. Off., sec. 579; 10 Am. Dec. 232; 64 id. 680; 1 Gr. Ev., secs. 19, 20, 21, 38a (13 Ed.); 2 Rob. (Ea.) 374; 24 Am. & Eng. Enc. Eaw, p. 5, note 5; 13 id. p. 509; Ell. Roads, etc., p. Ill; 31 Am. & Eng. Corp. Cases, p. 278. The proof necessary to establish a right by prescription, and the law governing the same has been settled. 47 Ark. 66; Id. 431; 50 id. 53; 58 id. 494; lb. 142. The street was accepted by lapse-of time; also by the act of 1873. 58 Ark. 142. In 58 Ark. 494, there was no acceptance, nor had the ten acres been sub-divided. Proof of any public work done on land to make it passable as a street, or near approaches to it to facilitate access to it, and the public use of it, are admissible, and shows not only use and possession of it as a highway, but acceptance of it as a highway. 9 N. E. 269; 5 id. 783; 11 id. 43; 24 N. W. 287; 11 id. 124; 33 id. 785; 106 111. 353; 30 N. W. 593, and note; 12 Atl. 130; 47 Ark. 436; 58 id. 494. When a street has been in use for a number of years, acceptance is presumed. 45 N. Y. 129; 47 Ark. 436; 12 Atl. 130. The assent of the owner will be inferred from silence and acquiescence in the public use. 2 R. I. 493, 499. There is a distinction also where the property separates the ends of abutting streets. 12 Atl. 130. It is too late to challenge the plat of Johnson’s Addition, no matter who made it. 24 Am. & Eng. Enc. Eaw, p. 6, and note 5. Where land in a city is conveyed as bounded by, or bordering on, a street, the vendor and vendee are estopped from denying that it is a public highway. 54 Am.

Where complainant and defendant were the owners of parcels of land and a strip about 35 feet wide lying between the two parcels was occupied by the defendant under a claim of adverse possession, based upon an ancient fence which had fallen into decay, and of which only the posts remained during the latter part of the alleged statutory period, the evidence also showing that a portion of the •fence had not been continuously maintained on a large part of the line at the south end of the parcel in dispute, the trial court erred in finding and adjudging that the defendant had secured any rights by adverse possession. 2. Same — Evidence—Burden of Proof. It is elementary that the burden of proving adverse possession rests upon the party who alleges it: strict construction of the doctrine is applied; possession must rest upon clear and positive proof, not inference. 3. Same. As a general rule the law will not presume that possession separate from the title to real property is of an adverse character and every presumption favors the construction that it was in subordination to the title of the true owner; there must be proof that the possession was actual, .continued, notorious, distinct, and hostile.

If a party erect anything offensive so\" near the house of another, that it becomes useless thereby, an action on the case will lie. But it does not lie if a man build a house and makes a cellar upon his own land, whereby a house newly built on adjoining premises falls down, nor if, by such building, he stops lights newly made in the house of another, though thé lights have continued for thirty or forty years.

In the absence of an adverse right by prescription, grant or otherwise, the owner has the right to erect a fence or building upon his own land, wrhich will have the effect to deprive the owner of adjacent premises of light and air to his house, and obstruct his view from the same, and such erection, unless made of offensive material, will not be a nuisance for which any action lies. 3.

Where a plaintiff is examined as a witness for the defendant, his testimony, given on the trial of a former action, between himself and another person, which is directly contrary to what he testifies to in the second suit, may he given in evidence, as an admission. The defendant has a right to prove the former testimony, as an admission, hy ^any competent witness, other than the plaintiff. He may also prove it hy the plaintiff himself, unless the latter objects on the ground that he is privileged from answering. A plaintiff is not bound to answer as to what he testified on a former trial; inasmuch as he might thus aid a prosecution against him for perjury. But the right to object is personal to him, as a w\\'itness. A defendant is not precluded from examining the plaintiff, or any other person, on that point, because his testimony might impeach the plaintiff as a witness. He has no right to use it for the latter purpose. Having called the plaintiff to testify, he thereby represents him as deserving of credit, and is precluded from denying it by introducing evidence for the purpose of impeaching him, showing either that his general character for truth is bad, or that he has made previous contradictory statements. But be may, by any pertinent evidence, prove a fact to be otherwise than as testified to by the plaintiff. A party is always at liberty to show w\\'hat the material facts of a case are, although in so doing he may contradict the testimony of some of his own witnesses, and the evidence may thus tend, indirectly, to discredit them. And these facts may be shown by the admissions of the opposite party, as well as by other evidence. The general rule, that the owner of land may use it according to his pleasure, is subject to this qualification, that he is not at liberty to use it in such a manner as to infringe the rights of others. The maxim, so use your own that you injure not another’s property, is supported by the soundest wisdom. But the injury intended is a legal injury; an inva- • sion of some legal right, as erecting a building, or carrying on a business on one’s own land, which so obstructs the enjoyment by another, of his property, as to amount to a nuisance; or removing the soil, or placing something on the soil of another. These are violations of absolute legal rights, and are strict legal injuries. But darkening another\\'s windows, or depriving him of a prospect, by building on one’s own land, where no right to the light unobstructed has been acquired by grant or prescription, digging by a person on his own soil, so as to endanger the foundation of the building of the adjoining owner, and numerous similar acts by an owner of land, impairing the enjoyment and value of the land of another, short of what the law deems a nuisance, invade no legal right, and hence are not legal injuries. In an action to recover damages of the defendant, for erecting a high fence upon his premises immediately adjoining the plaintiff’s dwelling house, and before his windows and doors, it is erroneous to charge the jury that the defendant had not a right to huild a fence on his own land, for the purpose of excluding the light from the plaintiff’s dwelling, and that if he has done so, and it has had that effect, ho is responsible in damages for the injury. The liability of the defendant, in such a case ought not to be made to depend upon the motives with which the erection was made. Bad motives, in doing an act which violates no legal right of another, cannot make the act a ground of action. In an action to recover damages for a nuisance caused by the erection of a barn or stable upon the defendant’s land adjoining the plaintiff’s dwelling house, and allowing manure and filthy water to accumulate and stand in the cellar thereof, it is not erroneous for the judge to charge the jury that if the defendant constructed and adapted the barn so that, in its ordinary use it would he injurious and offensive to the plaintiff, and cast unwholesome odors into his house, the defendant is liable for the nuisance thus caused by his tenants, to whom he had let the barn. Where a barn is built to he used in a certain way, and its use in that way would necessarily, under ordinary circumstances, he a nuisance, if it is let to a tenant who in fact uses it in that way, and such use proves noxious or injurious to adjoining occupants, the owner is liable for the injury. But if the use of the barn in that way proves a nuisance, by reason of water in the cellar, and that is a special unusual circumstance, the owner is not liable for the nuisance, unless he knew, or had reason to believe, when he let the bam, that the use of it in the ordinary mode would prove a nuisance. APPEAL by tbe defendant from a judgment entered at a special term, after a trial at the circuit. The complaint contained five counts. The first count charged that tbe defendant, in 1849, caused to be erected on his premises and along or near the north and east boundary lines of tbe plaintiff’s premises in tbe city of Rochester a high board fence, from eight to ten feet in height, and covered the same with gas tar, thereby causing offensive odors to enter the plaintiff’s dwelling bouse, and creating a nuisance therein. The second count charged that the defendant, in 1850, caused to be erected on his premises, along or near the north boundary line of the plaintiff’s premises, and contiguous to said dwelling, a long shed of boards, the roof of which was covered with gas tar, and caused to be placed about said shed a large quantity of combustible matter, and kept a fire burning several days near thereto, causing an offensive stench to enter said dwelling and exposing it to danger from fire. The third count charged that the defendant, in 1850, caused to be erected on his premises, and contiguous to the premises of the plaintiff, a brick stable, and caused to be dug under the same a cellar without a drain, and suffered a large quantity of manure and filthy water to accumulate and stand therein, thereby causing noisome stenches and vapors to come upon said premises of the plaintiff, creating thereon a nuisance. The fourth count alleged that the defendant, in 1852, opened and exposed a privy vault on his premises, near said premises of the plaintiff, and dug a cellar about the same, into which the contents of said vault oozed out, and permitted .the same for a long time to remain thus exposed, whereby noxious smells ascended into said dwelling, creating therein a nuisance. In the fifth count the plaintiff complained that the defendant, in 1852, procured said shed to be used as a hen house and horse barn, and allowed the manure and offal therefrom to accumulate under the windows of plaintiff’s dwelling, whereby noxious odors ascended into the plaintiff’s said dwelling, creating therein a nuisance. . The answer denied the complaint. The action was tried at a circuit court held in Monroe county in February, 1856, before Hon. B. Darwin Smith, justice. On the trial the plaintiff gave evidence proving that during the time of the alleged causes of action, the defendant occupied or controlled, built upon and let to use, premises on the corner of Elm and Chesnut streets in the city of Rochester ; that such premises consisted of a dwelling house on the corner of a lot running back towards the west: that said lot was one open lot joining the grounds to the dwelling house; that during the time of the said causes of action the plaintiff inhabited the premises adjoining on Elm street; that the plaintiff’s premises consisted of a dwelling house in which he lived with his family; that said house was bounded and surrounded on the north and east by said grounds of the defendant; that there was ample room in the back part of the defendant’s grounds to build the barn and shed without putting them against the plaintiff’s house, and .that all\" of the grounds of the plaintiff consisted of a small front door yard on the south of his house; that on the west his house abutted on Cedar street and had three or four windows on the north and one on the east; and proving the building of the fence mentioned in the first count of the complaint, and the painting of the same with gas tar; that the same was so painted or covered with gas tar, by the defendant, in 1849, after the premises were purchased by the plaintiff, but before he occupied them, and remained up .about a year, and was repeatedly during that time painted with gas tar; and that the said gas tar gave off offensive and sickening odors—offensive and sickening to the plaintiff and his family. The plaintiff also gave evidence proving that the defendant, about the month of January, 1850, erected the shed mentioned in the second count of the complaint, a portion o£ which he also painted with gas tar, which was in the like manner offensive to the plaintiff’s family; that said shed was built on the north of the plaintiff’s house, on the grounds of which the defendant had the care and letting, and that the inside wall of the shed was a part of the said fence, and that said shed was opposite some of the windows of the plaintiff’s house ; also, that a fire was one night seen blazing in the defendant’s yard about ten feet from the shed; that the defendant was waked in the night and notified of it, and got up and helped put it out. But no proof was given as to who built or started such fire. The plaintiff further gave evidence proving that in the spring of the year 1850, the defendant let his dwelling house next east of the plaintiff’s premises to Ogilvie L. Sheldon, and in the month of September following let to him the premises north thereof, and north of the plaintiff’s premises, having previously agreed with Sheldon to erect thereon a brick horse barn for said Sheldon’s use: that he so erected the same during the summer of the year 1850, locating the same on the north of the plaintiff’s premises, and only about a foot and a half therefrom, building it with a cellar about seven feet deep, of which about four were below the surface of the earth, without a drain, although it was perfectly practicable to have made adrain—\\'building it with a trap door in the floor, down which manure might be thrown, Avith windows and a door in the cellar on the north and west sides thereof, and with\\' a double door on the west end, on the first floor, for admitting a carriage, and a door and windows on the north side thereof, and that on so building he let the same together with said shed which was west thereof, and the surrounding grounds to Sheldon. That Sheldon took possession of said stable and horse barn and of said shed and grounds connected therewith, on the first day of September, 1850, in pursuance of the terms of said lease, and continued in possession and use thereof till the expiration of such lease; that said Sheldon-was in the habit of throwing a part of the manure from his horse into the cellar, and a parí of it out of the north door of the barn ; that water stood in the cellar and the manure saturated with the water created offensive odors, which affected the atmosphere of the plaintiff’s dwelling, and rendered the same poxious and uncomfortable to the plaintiff and his family; and that Dr. Dodge and Dr. Collins, the subsequent tenants, who in like manner hired the premises, continued to use them in the same way and with the same effect. As to the state and condition of the premises at the time Dodge and Collins took them of the defendant, Thomas B. Collins testified that his impression was, that when he and Dodge went into the barn, there was no manure there; and when they went away, a large pile had gathered there, lío other testimony was given on that point. Sheldon stated that while he occupied such barn, he informed the defendant that the barn and manure were very offensive to the plaintiff’s family, and desired the defendant to drain the cellar or to fill it up ; but he did not do either, and said that he did not care for Pickard’s family, and refused to make a drain or fill up the cellar. The plaintiff further gave evidence that the tenants of the said shed had used it for a joiner’s shop and lumber room, and as a henery, and that a great stench therefrom filled the plaintiff’s house and rendered it unfit for habitation; and that for a while in the summer of 1853, and before the commencement of this action, a tenant had used it as a stable and had kept his horse there, at which time the manure had been piled up under the plaintiff’s windows, and that on opening the windows to the plaintiff’s house, a horrid odor from the manure of the liens and horse came into the dwelling and rendered the atmosphere of the plaintiff’s dwelling highly offensive and noxious. As to the occupancy of the shed at that time, Robert R. Harris testified that he knew, by sight, the tenant that occupied the shed for a stable; that he did not know who had used it for other purposes; that he did not know that Mr. Collins, the defendant, had a horse at that time; that he as city superintendent, by direction of the board of health, proceeded to abate the nuisance, but instead of removing the offensive matter and leaving the shed standing, he tore down the shed and left the offensive matter unremoved; that before tearing it down he had examined the shed and requested the defendant to remove it, who treated the subject indifferently, and replied that it was not a nuisance, and refused to remove it; and that the superintendent then requested him to go with him and examine it, but the defendant refused to do so; that when the superintendent proceeded to pull it down, the defendant, with his attorney, came to the spot to forbid pulling down the shed, but it was already down. It further appeared that defendant had never directed nor advised the tenant how to use the premises, nor where to put the manure. The plaintiff proved that while Sheldon occupied the horse barn, the defendant put gas tar upon the roof from time to time—as many as three or four coats—thereby creating an offensive odor, nauseous to Sheldon’s own family as well as to the plaintiff’s family; that it took each coat some three or four days to dry, and that until dry, it smelled badly; that in drying the odor passed off. The plaintiff also gave evidence, proving that in the summer of 1852, the defendant put up a brick building on the east side of the plaintiff’s dwelling for a joiner’s shop, and on the spot was an old privy vault; that in digging and excavating for the foundation of such building, the earth was removed from around the privy vault and the contents oozed out into the defendant’s cellar, producing an insufferable stench, which continued some two or three weeks before the same was removed by the defendant. As to the defendant’s fence, the plaintiff gave evidence proving that the same rendered the plain tiff’s habitation very dark, cutting off the light and leaving it too dark to inhabit. The defendant’s counsel proved the title of the premises adjoining the plaintiff on the north and east to be in Oliver Collins, by deed dated prior to 1849, and then read in evidence the lease above mentioned. He then offered in evidence a judgment roll of a judgment in favor of Oliver Collins, plaintiff, against said Pickard, defendant, docketed Nov. 2, 1858. That suit was for a trespass, alleged to have been committed by Pickard on the lands of Oliver Collins, which trespass was said to have consisted in sawing off and carrying away portions of a fence, throwing snow off from his house on to a shed, injuring shrubbery, throwing slops, and tipping over a barrel of gas tar and spreading it around, and on a fence of Oliver Collins. The plaintiff in that suit recovered a judgment against the defendant therein, for $37.50 damages, and $58.03 costs. This proof was objected to on the ground that, 1. It was inadmissible under the pleadings. 2. That it was entirely immaterial what trespasses Pickard had committed against Oliver Collins or his premises. 3. On the ground that the judgment roll was not filed until November, 1853, while this action was commenced June 28th, 1853. 4. That the judgment was not inter partes, nor between privies, and was not admissible in favor of the defendant. This objection was sustained, and the defendant’s counsel excepted. Lysander Farrar called and sworn for the defendant, testified: “I am an attorney and counsellor of this court; some years ago I defended Edwin W. Collins on the trial of an indictment for a nuisance in connection with the premises now •in suit; Daniel L. Pickard was examined as a witness for the people, and gave evidence; I cannot recollect what he testified; I kept the minutes of said trial. (The minutes were here produced.) These are my minutes ; I took them at the trial; I endeavored to take them correctly: I believe that I did take them correctly; on reading them they do not refresh my memory as to what Pickard testified to ; endeavored to take the minutes correctly, but I cannot now say whether they are correct, nor can I say whether they contain all the testimony that Pickard gave at the time.” The defendant’s counsel now proposed that the witness read from his minutes what Pickard testified to at that trial. To this the plaintiff’s counsel objected, oh the ground that witness could not say that the minutes were correct, and could not say that they contained all the testimony given by Pickard. Objection sustained and defendant’s counsel excepted. Daniel L. Pickard called and sworn for the defendant, testified: “ I am plaintiff in this action ; I occupy the premises; I began to occupy them in the neighborhood of 1848 or 1849 ; I left them two years ago last summer, as near as I can recollect; I was a witness on a trial of an indictment against Collins for a nuisance; I testified on that occasion about this gas tar; the fence was built after I bought the premises, but before I moved in ¡ I can’t tell how long before I moved in the fence was built; when I moved in the fence was there and freshly built; the fence was painted with gas tar before I went in, and repeatedly after; portions of the fence have been painted after I went in there; it continued to be painted over in parts as long as I lived there.” Question by the defendant’s counsel: “Did you or did you not state, upon the trial of the indictment, that no gas tar had been put on the fence after you moved in there ?” Question objected to, on the ground that the defendant had made the plaintiff his witness and could not impeach him; and also that he should ask him as to the fact, and not to what he had before said ; and also that the question was immaterial. The defendant’s counsel claimed that he was entitled to the answer, as an admission of a party to the suit. Objection sustained and question overruled, to which the defendant’s counsel excepted. Question by the defendant’s counsel: “ Did you on that occasion testify that it was yourself that upset the barrel of gas tar, and spilled it on the ground?” Objected to on the grounds stated in objection to last question. Objection sustained, and exception. “I did upset the barrel of gas tar; I bought a jug of gas tar from the gas works ; I delivered it to the gentleman who sent for it, Mr. Adams ; I afterwards saw the jug; after I took it from the gas works, 1 saw the jug in Mr. Adams’ barn ; about the time Mr. Adams left Rochester.” Question by the defendant’s counsel : “ Did you on the former trial state that you could not tell what you did with the contents of the jug without criminating yourself?” Objected to on the grounds as above. Objection sustained and exception taken by the defendant’s counsel. On the case thus made, the defendant’s counsel asked the plaintiff’s counsel if they claimed to recover on all the counts of the complaint, to which the reply was in the affirmative. Thereupon the defendant’s counsel moved for a nonsuit, on the third count or cause of action set up in the complaint, and objected to the plaintiff’s recovering therefor, on the ground that the defendant only built the barn and let the premises to tenants, and it was by the way and manner in which the tenants used the barn or stable that the nuisance, if any, was produced, and not by any thing done or suffered by the defendant. This motion and objection were overruled by the court, and to that decision the defendant’s counsel excepted. The defendant then moved for a nonsuit, and objected to the plaintiff’s recovering on the fifth count or cause of action stated in the complaint, that is, for the shed being used as a horse stable and henery; on the ground that it did not appear that the defendant had ever so used it or authorized such use, and that he was not responsible for any use to which it was put by tenants. This motion and objection were overruled by the court, and to such decision the defendant’s counsel excepted. The defendant’s counsel then objected to the plaintiff’s recovery in respect to \"the fire kindled in the yard, on the ground that it did not appear that the defendant kindled it; and insisted that the court should not submit that matter to the jury, but such objection and request were overruled by the court, and to his decision the defendant’s counsel excepted. The defendant’s counsel claimed that in respect to the brick horse barn or stable, the defendant had absolutely a legal right to build and let it, and hence the plaintiff could not call in question the defendant’s motives in so doing, and make them a cause of action. The defendant’s counsel claimed the same in respect to the building and letting the shed and other premises; but that if the defendant’s motives in building and letting either the barn there was no sufficient proof for the jury of any motive or design in the defendant to wrong or injure the plaintiff in so doing. case must go to the jury on all the causes of action stated in cepted. The judge charged the jury, among other things, in substance as follows: “The case involves purely a question of fact. The action is for nuisance, and the complaint contains five counts. The first count, or cause of action, is for erecting a high board fence close to the plaintiff’s windows, and covering it with gas tar, thereby darkening the plaintiff’s rooms, and conveying into them noxious and sickening odors. The second relates to the shed and henery. The third to the barn. The fourth to the privy vault. And the fifth to the fire in the defendant’s yard. If either of these is a nuisance, the plaintiff is entitled to recover. A nuisance is something noxious or offensive to any of the senses, either to the sense of sight or hearing, as well as of smelling; and that may be a nuisance which offends none of the senses, if it be deleterious to the health or safety, or noxious to human enjoyment. What is a nuisance is a question of fact. The first proposition of law which I submit to you is that every man hath such a title to his own land that he may use it for all purposes to which such land is usually applied, without being answerable for the consequences, direct or indirect, to others. For instance, the defendant in this tion had a perfect right to build a fence on this lot in the usual and customary way, for the ordinary and legitimate enjoyment of his premises. But he had not a right to build a fence in an unusual manner, materially to annoy and injure his neighbor, and deprive him of the use and enjoyment of his lot; for a man is bound so to use his own as to do no needless injury to his neighbor. As an illustration of the principle of law which I have stated, I will give you the following: While as a general rule a person may use his property as he wishes to, it has been do- or shed could give the piaintiff a right of action like this, still But the court overruled these objections, and decided that the the complaint, and to that decision the defendant’s counsel ex- tided that a man cannot, on a city lot, dig down to an unusual and great depth for purposes extraordinary to the common use of such land, whereby the land of his adjoining neighbor is undermined and falls in, and that he is liable for the damages if he do so. To this proposition the defendant’s counsel excepted. So a man may dig in his own grounds in the usual way, and of any ordinary depth, but a man has no right to dig down a pit or trench of unusual depth adjoining the house or building of bis neighbor, and if he do so, and his neighbor’s wall or earth thereby fall into it, he is liable for the damage. The question is whether the construction of this fence and the putting on of gas tar, were within any of the purposes for which \\' such land is ordinarily used. If it was it was lawful, whoever may be injured. But if you find that the defendant put this fence there, or covered it with gas tar, as stated by the witness, for the purpose of injuring or annoying the plaintiff, and rendering the use and enjoyment of his premises uncomfortable or unhealthy, and it had that effect, that would be an unreasonable use of bis property, and he must be responsible for any damages or injury done thereby. The defendant had a right to build and use a barn on the lands occupied by him, and to let it to be used to tenants, and he is not responsible for the acts of the tenants unless procured or instigated by him. But if you shall find that this barn was noxious and injurious, and a nuisance, in fact, to the plaintiff, and that the defendant located it where it was, and constructed and adapted it so that in its ordinary use it would be injurious and offensive to the plaintiff, and cast unwholesome odors into his house, then the defendant is liable for the nuisance thus caused, and the plaintiff is entitled to recover in respect to such nuisance. If the barn was built to be used in a certain way, and was let to a tenant who in fact used it in that way, and such use proved injurious or noxious to the plaintiff, the defendant is responsible for such injury. The same is true of the shed which I have stated respecting the barn. As to the privy vault, the defendant had a perfect right to remove it, with a view to improve his premises or otherwise. The removal of it must necessarily occasion more or less annoyance. If it was removed so as to occasion no more offense than was necessary, the defendant is not liable \\\\ but if in the time or manner of doing it he was remiss or negligent, or if he allowed it to infect the surrounding atmosphere an unreasonable length of time, it would be a nuisance during such needless excess of time, for which he is responsible. There is no evidence that the defendant kindled or procured the fire to be kindled ; and even had he been the author of it with an intent to injure the plaintiff, an action against him for malicious mischief would have been more proper than this action for nuisance. I am of opinion that the fire was not a nuisance, and that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover in respect to this cause of action. If you shall find that the henery was erected and used, or procured to be used, by the defendant, in an unusual and extraordinary manner, and so as to injure or annoy the plaintiff, and that the defendant used it, or procured it to be used, with a design to injure and annoy the plaintiff, and that it actually was injurious and annoying to the plaintiff, that would make it a nuisance while it so remained, and the plaintiff is entitled to your verdict in respect to such nuisance. If you find for the plaintiff, you are to give him, 1st. Damages equal to his pecuniary loss, and a just recompense for his discomfort and annoyance from these nuisances. 2d. The case is one for exemplary damages ; if you find that the alleged nuisances were put there maliciously, and with intent to injure and annoy the plaintiff, in that case you are entitled to give damages by way of smart money. You may give such damages as you shall think proper under the circumstances of the case, and such as shall be calculated to deter others from committing like offenses. In this respect you are not limited by any precise rules of law. It is a question within your discretion.” The defendant’s counsel excepted to each and every part of the above charge. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for $>1250. J. N. Pomeroy, for the plaintiff. E. A. Hopkins, for the defendant.',\n",

Land Court, Exceptions Way, Private. Easement. Devise and Legacy. * On exceptions to a decision of a judge of the Land Court, where the bill of exceptions set forth all the evidence and stated that a decision of the trial judge which contained findings of fact might be referred to, and where the findings of fact were warranted by the evidence and by inferences that might have been drawn therefrom, it was held, that such findings were conclusive and that this court could not consider whether they were supported by the weight of the evidence or whether a different inference could have been drawn from the facts. The owner of a large tract of land, bounded northerly on a street and southerly on a harbor, fenced off a portion of it which bordered on the street and used it for homestead purposes, erecting thereon a house and stable and making a garden. He used the remainder of the land for building purposes and constructed from .the street toward the harbor a private way, which he intended for use in con\"nection with all parts of his homestead property and also of his business property and which was the only reasonable means of access to the stable and garden lots. He then made a will, in the second clause of which he gave the “ homestead ... as now enclosed ” to his wife, and, after clauses in which he completed his testamentary dispositions, in a sixteenth clause he directed “ that the garden situate southerly of the dwelling house ... shall be a part of the homestead given my wife in the second item ... and I do hereby devise said garden to my said wife as a part of said homestead.” One, who after the death of the testator had acquired the homestead property by mesne conveyances from the testator’s wife, erected on a part of the house lot and on the stable and garden lots a theatre, and claimed a right to use the private way in connection with it. Held, that it was the intention of the testator to give to his wife with the land an easement of passage over the way, which was not restricted to the use of the gates then in the enclosure nor to domestic purposes, but was to be left to be adapted to the convenience and desires of occupants of the estate from time to time; and therefore that her successor in title had a right to use the way in connection with his theatre. Discussion by Sheldon, J., of the law with regard to easements which, although not expressly described in an instrument of conveyance, pass with the dominant estate by implication because they are reasonably necessary to its use and enjoyment, are open and continuous and are in use at the time of the conveyance. Petition, filed in the Land Court on July 23,1907, for the registration of the title to land in Gloucester fronting southerly on Gloucester harbor and northerly on Main Street. The respondents claimed the right to use a way through land of the petitioner in connection with land owned by them fronting on Main Street and immediately east of the way and the land of the petitioner. In the Land Court the case was tried before Davis, J. He found the following facts in substance: In 1852 the land of the respondents and the greater part of that of the petitioner was included in a tract of pasture land, known as Trask field, which then was purchased by John Pew, a Gloucester merchant engaged in the fisheries. The field sloped up from Main Street, at which point it was low and springy, over a rocky incline, and thence dropped off to the harbor. On the water front, Pew built wharves and docks with a flake yard to the north thereof. Running from Main Street to the wharves near the west line of the Trask field, he built the way now in question, leaving, however, a narrow strip of land at the northwesterly corner for a store, now contained in a brick block, and for a yard and for fish flakes, and at the northeasterly corner a tract of land having a frontage of sixty-five feet on Main Street, a depth southerly along the way in question of three hundred and twelve feet, and a width on the southerly end of sixty-two feet, for a house lot, stable and garden comprising his homestead estate which is now the property of the respondents. This homestead estate he filled and graded, building a mansion house on the front part facing on Main Street, with a stable in the rear and a garden which he cultivated and in which he also had a hen house and yard. The portion of the lot on which the house was built was filled in so that the house stood above the street and way, with bankings and some ornamental shrubbery about it, and there was a wall surmounted by an ornamental fence along Main Street, with gates for foot passengers opening to walks leading to the front and back doors of the house, to the cellar doors and cellar windows, and to stone steps to the stable yard, and there was a wall surmounted by a similar fence along the way in question as far south as an embankment wall which was between the house and the stable. Back of the house the land made an abrupt drop to the stable. The embankment wall was surmounted by a low fence with a gate in it between the house and the stable and stable yard, and a flight of stone steps leading down from the house to the stable yard. A trellis and fence with an opening in it separated the stable and stable yard from the garden. Access to the stable, stable yard and garden was had from the private way in question through a swing gate for teams opening on to a driveway to the stable yard and stable, located opposite the stable and large enough to admit a wagon, the opening thus made into the driveway being in a high slat fence which ran from the embankment wall around the west, south and east sides of the property now owned by the respondents. The fences above mentioned completely enclosed the house, stable and garden. Pew lived in the house and occupied the whole of the premises now owned by the respondents as his homestead until his death. Until 1868 he kept in the stable a horse and carriage for his own use, and also at times one used in the firm business. In 1868 he had a runaway accident which lamed him for life, and thereafter he kept no horse. From then on the stable was used mostly for storage purposes, and in the stable yard and driveway were from time to time kept portable chicken coops. Access to the stable, stable yard and garden was, however, still had as occasion might require through the gates opposite the stable which opened upon the way in question. In going between his house and place of business, Pew sometimes came out his side door, down the stone steps to the stable yard, and thence out by the stable gate and down the way in question to the wharves. Sometimes, however, he went out through his front gate to Main Street and around by the store. As he grew older he used the stone steps and stable gate less and less. It appeared that the gates opposite the stable opening from the way were locked at times to prevent boys from getting into the yard to the magnolia and fruit trees, and that in the later years of Pew’s life the use of the gates for any purpose was very infrequent; but the judge found that the gate was not permanently closed up. The use of the way so far as Pew personally was concerned in his actual occupation of the premises was largely discontinued, but there was no abandonment of the use of the way in connection with the premises or permanent interruption thereof. In 1868 Pew bought additional land on Main Street adjoining the store on the west, and a brick block was erected covering that lot and the piece of the Trask field formerly occupied by the store. He also bought some house lots south of the store which fronted on an adjoining street called Vincent Street. For many years and until his death the block and the wharf properties were rented by Pew to the firm in which he was the principal partner, and the way was in constant use in connection with the firm properties, constituting the principal means of access to the wharves and flake yards, and the only entrance to the side and back doors of the store and block and to a yard and small building back of the store. Cottages were erected on the house lots which were rented to employees of Pew or of the firm. The tenants used the, way in question. After 1879 the way was and now is defined on its west side by fences and a wall and the side of the brick block. The way in question was always kept in repair by the firm, and the cost charged into the firm’s expenses, along with rent, in their accounts with Mr. Pew. In Pew’s lifetime or at his death a driveway ten feet wide, as far as the stable yard and stable, could have been built from Main Street over the front lot now of the respondents, which was worth about $10,000, for about $150. Such a driveway would have been very disadvantageous to the remainder of the house lot. A way ten feet wide would not have been adequate for the development and use of the stable and garden lots, either for business purposes or for cutting up into house lots, and a way twenty feet wide running back into the garden for the development and use of the property would have cost from $750 to $900 and would have greatly impaired the availability, use and value of the garden lot by narrowing the lots into which the garden could have been divided. The homestead estate at the time when Pew’s will was made and at his death was in a residential and business neighborhood. Pew made a will in 1876, by the second paragraph of which he left his “ homestead ... in said Gloucester as now enclosed ” to his wife, and by the sixteenth paragraph he directed “ that the garden situated southerly of the dwelling-house occupied by me . . . shall be a part of the homestead given my wife in the second item of the will, and I do hereby devise said garden to my said wife as a part of said homestead.” He died in March, 1890, and his will was proved. His widow occupied the homestead, including the house, stable and garden, until her death in December, 1890, when she devised it to her daughter, who occupied it for nearly ten years, and from whom it passed in 1900 to the respondents by mesne conveyances duly recorded, each containing the usual habendum clause “ with all the privileges and appurtenances thereto belonging. ” The fee to the way and to the other land described in the petition for registration was devised to the testator’s sons. The respondents upon acquiring title levelled off the front land and erected a permanent wooden building used as a theatre and opera house, covering the middle portion of the property, including the southerly end of the house lot, the whole of the stable yard, and the northerly end of the garden, and having its stage entrances and only intended means of access by teams on and from the way in question. They removed the gates and the fence along the way. At the place where the gate opposite the stable formerly was located, the theatre building completely blocks entrance from the way to the property, except for the purpose of entering the theatre. The theatre building also blocks all access to the stable by horses or wagons. - The respondents have used all the land between the house and the way in question, a width of from twenty-one to twenty-three feet, as an entrance for spectators from Main Street and have levelled it and covered it with cement for that purpose. The house and stable are still standing in their original location, and are in use by the respondents. In 1902 a cottage house was moved on to the southerly part of the garden lot by the respondents and is occupied by them. The judge found as a fact that at the time the will was made and at the date of the testator’s death, the only reasonable means of access to the stable and garden lots was by means of the way in question, and ruled that under the will of John Pew his widow took as appurtenant to the homestead and garden specifically devised to her under the above described second and sixteenth clauses of the will an easement of passage to and from Main Street for all convenient purposes in the land within the limits of the way in question, and that the respondents by mesne conveyances are now the owners of the estate so devised to her. A decree was ordered accordingly; and the petitioner alleged exceptions. The bill of exceptions contained a recital of all the material facts in evidence and a statement that a decision of the trial judge’s finding, which contained a detailed statement of facts found by him, might “be referred to.” H.

Way, Private, extent of easement. Evidence, Extrinsic affecting writings, Materiality. Deed, Construction. Whether the reasonable use of a right of way over a strip of land ten feet wide belonging to the owner of the adjoining lot on a city street, which leads along a division fence to the street, is inconsistent with the maintenance by the owner of such adjoining land of suitable gates at the ends of the way in the division fence and upon the street, where the manner of use is wholly undefined by the deed granting the right of way, besides a question of law involves the question of fact, what is a reasonable use of the property of the respective parties. Upon the question, whether the reasonable use of a right of way over a strip of land ten feet wide belonging to the owner of the adjoining lot on a city street, which leads along a division fence to the street, is inconsistent with the maintenance by the owner of such adjoining land of suitable gates at the end of the way in the division fence and upon, the street, where the deed granting the right of way merely used the words “ Together with a right of way over a strip of my land next adjoining the above lot, ten feet wide, and extending back from the street seventy-five feet,” it is competent for the owner of the servient land, claiming the right to maintain the gates, to show that for at least twenty-five years before the owner of the right of way purchased his lot, including a period when the two lots were owned by the same person but were occupied by different persons, a driveway for carriages was used very nearly in the place where the way ten feet wide was established by the deed and that gates were maintained in the fence near the boundary line afterwards established by the deed and also at the entrance to the way from the street, the method of using the driveway by former owners and occupants under substantially the same conditions being some evidence of what was reasonable and convenient in the occupation and enjoyment of the property. Where the meaning of the parties to a deed as to the nature or extent of an easement granted by it is left doubtful by the language of the instrument, evidence of the subsequent use of the premises by the parties is competent as showing their construction of the deed. In a suit in equity by the owner of a lot on a street of a city, to restrain the defendant, who was the owner of the adjoining lot over which the plaintiff had a right of way, from obstructing such way by maintaining gates at each end of it, it appeared, by a master’s report, that on each of the lots there was a cottage house, the plaintiff’s house being about eighteen and a half feet and the defendant’s house about sixteen and a half feet from the boundary line, on which there was a fence, that the plaintiff’s right of way was created by a grant in these words, “Together with a right of way over a strip of my land next adjoining the above [the plaintiff\\'s] lot, ten feet wide, and extending back from the street seventy-five feet,” that the defendant placed and maintained a gate thirteen feet wide in the division fence and also a gate ten feet wide across the entrance to the way from the street on which both lots faced, that the houses on the lots were occupied as the homes of the plaintiff and of the defendant respectively and had yards of considerable size about them, that the street was a much travelled way with an electric car line upon it, that the family of the defendant at times had been annoyed by animals straying from the street upon the defendant’s land when the gates were left open and that one member of the defendant’s family was a child three years of age, that for at least twenty-five years before the plaintiff purchased his lot a driveway for carriages was used very nearly i,n the place where the plaintiff’s right of way was established by the deed, that during that time gates had been maintained in the fence near the present boundary line and at the entrance to the defendant’s lot from the street, and that both of these gates had been kept closed except when the driveway was in use for carriages or teams, that the former occupants of both houses used the driveway for teams but that it was not used generally by persons on foot. The master found upon evidence introduced by the plaintiff, that gates to driveways on premises in the neighborhood usually were kept open by the owners and occupants for their own convenience. The master found that, if the defendant had the right to maintain gates, the gates maintained by him were suitable ones. Held, that, on the facts found by the master, a reasonable and proper use of the houses and lands of the parties and of the plaintiff’s right of way over the defendant’s land permitted the maintenance by the defendant, against the plaintiff\\'s objection, of convenient and suitable gates such as these were found to have been. Bill ie equity, filed in the Superior Court on June 26,1909, to restrain the defendant from obstructing by gates a right of way owned by the plaintiff over the land of the defendant on the easterly side of Bay Street in Taunton. The case was referred to L. Elmer Wood, Esquire, as master. The master filed a report in which he made the findings which are stated in the opinion. The plaintiff filed a single exception to the master’s report on the ground “ that the defendant was allowed to introduce evidence relating to the maintaining and closing of the said gates by former owners of the dominant and servient estate prior to June 3,1909, to vary and limit the terms of the grant by paroi evidence.” June 3,1909, was the date on which the master found that the plaintiff took down a part of the fence, which at that time divided the land of the plaintiff from that of the defendant, and the defendant built a new fence on the street and on part of the boundary line and put in place the gates which the plaintiff sought to enjoin her from maintaining. The case was heard by De Qourcy, J., who overruled the plaintiff’s exception to the master’s report, and confirmed the report. He made a final decree that the plaintiff’s bill be dismissed; and the plaintiff appealed. Below is a reduced copy of the plan used at the hearing before the master and afterwards before this court.

       "  'case_summary': \"Herrick vs. Stover. The record of a private road laid out by commissioners designating the course, distance and quantity of land taken, is sufficiently definite to shew that the road was intended to be two rods wide, and paroi evidence that such would be the result from the data given is admissible. Where a party obtains a right to a prívale road of the width of txoo rods, the owner of the land through which it passes must so build his fences as to leave full two rods in width in every part of the road ; he cannot build a Virginia fence, placing the centre on the exterior lines of the two rods with the angles projecting into the road. A party will be deemed to have assented to such location of the fences, if apprised that the damages of the owner of the lands were assessed in reference to such location, or if he permits the fences to be thus built without objection. Although a suit is manifestly vexatious and a plaintiff entitled to only nomU nal damages, a judgment of a subordinate tribunal, if erroneous, will be reversed. Error from the Rensselaer common pleas. Herrick sued Stover in a justice’s court for an encroachment upon a private road, obtained by him over the lands of the defendant, under the statute regulating highways. The encroachment consisted in (he building of worm or Virginia rail fences, on each side of the road, so near to each other that in eleven places the width of the road was only 22 feet and xaT of an incii on an average, varying'from about 20 to 23 feet, instead of two rods. The justice rendered judgment for the plaintiff for six cents damages, and $1,81 costs. The defendant appealed to the Rensselaer common pleas, where the cause was again tried. The plaintiff produced a record of the road, containing a particular description of the place of beginning, the courses and distances, stating its extent across the lands of the defendant to be 19 chains and 74 links, and its contents to be 3 roods and 38 perches of land. The road was laid out by commissioners on the oath of twelve freeholders declaring it to be proper. The surveyor emploj'ed by the commissioners testified that he ran but one line; (hat the road was calculated to be two rods wide, measuring from the line run by him as a centre, and that only by estimating the road to be two rods wide, could the quantity of land taken amount to 3 roods and 38 perches: this evidence was objected to by the defendant, but received by the court. The encroachment by means of the fences was proved as above stated ; they are worm rail fences, the centres of which are placed on the exterior line of the two rods, angling alternately on the land of the defendant and on the road, having stakes at each angle. The road is on high ground, and subject to drifts in the winter season ; it was laid out in July, 1824; in September following the defendant built the fences, and in the ensuing month of October, the plaintiff required the defendant to remove them. The damages of the plaintiff were appraised at $100, including $10, the costs of the proceedings, which sum was paid to the defendant, who elected to use the road in common with the plaintiff. On the part of the defendant, it was proved by two of the commissioners who assessed the damages of the defendant by reason of the road, that they made their assessment on the assumption that rail fences were to be built, and that the cen^re 0f j[le fences was to be placed on the exterior of the two rods; that it was spoken of by the parties that rail fences were to be built, and that in the presence of the parties (hey made an estimate of the number of rails necessary for the building of the fences; and that on the assumption that the fences were to be placed otherwise than on the centre of the exterior lines of the two rods, they would have assessed the damages at a greater amount: this evidence was objected to, but received. The defendant further proved that 1 he fences were built as nearly on the exterior line of the two rods as possible, and that one of the commissioners of highways who laid out the road directed the fences to be built on the line; this direction was given to a son of the defendant, when the other commissioners and the plaintiff were present, but whether the plaintiff heard the directions, the witness could not say : this testimony was also objected to, but received. The court charged the jury that the width of the road was not designated by the record, and that (hey must decide whether it was intended to be two rods wide or not; if they should find it was to be of that width, there could be no doubt that the defendant had encroached upon it, and the plaintiff was entitled to their verdict for such damages as they should think proper to allow ; but if they believed that the commissioners of highways declared and intended at the time of the laying out of the road that the fences should be placed as they had been placed, and that the plaintiff so understood it and assented to the assessment of damages according to such understanding, and that the fences had been placed according to such assent and understanding of the parties, then they should find for the defendant. The jury found a verdict for the defendant, on which judgment was entered, The plaintiff having had a bill of exceptions signed, sued out a writ of error. H. P. Hunt, for plaintiff in error. The evidence of the surveyor was properly received; it did not contradict or vary the record, but was entirely consistent with it, and therefore admissible. 1 Phil. Ev. ch. 10, § 2. He was called to shew how the quantity of land specified in the record was arrived at. All the testimony in the case, however, shews that the road was to be two rods wide. The evidence of the direction given by the commissioners of highways as to the placing of the fence, and of the principles on which the appraisers assessed the damages, was illegal, and ought not to have been received, because it was not shewn that the plaintiff was privy to those transactions. The court erred in submitting the question of the width of the road to the jury as a question of fact, when the record and the explanatory evidence was conclusive ; and they also erred in directing the jury that (hey might infer a license to the defendant to build the fence in the manner in which it was built. J. Pierson, for defendant in error. The court ought not to have permitted any evidence of the width of the road other than the record; the commissioners are required to make records of their proceedings in relation to roads, and such records are the only proper evidence. 2 R. L. 276. 9 Johns. R. 365, Parol evidence is inadmissible to supply, contradict or explain a record. 11 Johns. R. 201. 24 id. 1. 8 id. 189. Roberts on Frauds, 10. The width of a private road is not specifically defined by statute; the only provision on the subject is, that it shall not be more than three rods wide. 2 R. L. 277. The evidence of the declarations of the commissioners was therefore proper; and the testimony of Che appraisers was also correctly received, as it furnished evidence of the assent of the plaintiff to the building of the fences in the manner in which they were erected. If the plaintiff did .so assent, or give licence previous to the appraisement of the damages, he could not subsequently revoke it; but if he had the power to do so, he did not revoke. The notice to remove the fences given in October was not obligatory upon the defendant; a notice to remove fences should state specially the extent of the encroachment. 9 Johns. R. 359. The plaintiff’s action is vexatious; when he recovered before the justice, he obtained judgment for but six cents damages, and if any error has occurred on the trial, it is sub- mi tied whether the judgment beloxv ought to' be reversed. Was this an application for a new trial, the court would not hesitate to refuse it. 3 Johns. R. 528, 240. 2 T. R. 4. 1 Burr. 11. 2 id. 664. Hunt, in reply. The plaintiff is entitled to his right of way; the road is on high land, and exposed in the winter season to obstructions from snows. He has therefore cause of complaint, that his road of 33 feet in width is reduced one third by the acts of the defendant, and is entitled to protection in the enjoyment of his rights, let his damages be what they may.\",\n",

In a second action for a continued trespass, the former verdict and judgment is evidence, but not conclusive, of title.

Measure of damages for a continued trespass. Trespass quare clausum fregit, for damages to real property in the city of Wilmington. Miss Cling and Mrs. Stevens were bwners of adjoining lots on Market street, with buildings on each, and the object of the suit was to settle the dividing line. The defendant, being about to rebuild her house, called out the city regulators, by whose measurement, the plaintiff’s house was found to be several inches over the line, and which was cut away to that extent; for which trespass this suit was brought. After evidence of title on both sides had been put in, the defen dont offered in evidence the certificate of William H. jones and A. W. Smith, city regulators, stating that they had regulated the front and the south side line of Mrs. R. Stephens’ lot in Market street (east side) between Fourth and Fifth streets, marking the said side or boundary line (between the lot\\'of Mrs. Stevens and that of Miss Cling) parallel with Fifth street, and at the distance of forty-four feet and seven inches from the south side of Fifth street, and decided the true dividing line between said properties. Mr. Bayard. It is a mere ex parte proceeding, made at the instance of one party, on her papers, now offered to decide the legal right of property. The city regulators have no such power. Their power is to regulate the walls “ as to breadth or thickness thereof” according to known or acknowledged lines and not to decide the lines. It is a mere police arrangement to see that houses are properly built in reference to the line of the streets, and the gutters; and the width of party walls, as between the parties, or other walls with reference to the public safety. These regulators seem to have repudiated almost the only power which they had; for they did what they could not do, and left undone what they were bound to do. Mr. Patterson. These certificates show the measurements of the city regulators, according to which the wall was built. They are certificates from legally constituted officers and are evidence of the object of such regulations. What are these objects ? To prevent irregularities and controversies relating to foundations and party walls, a power necessary to be exercised sumriiarily, especially in a city. If every controversy of the kind must abide delay of suits at law, it would constantly stop improvement. The jurisdiction of these matters has been properly vested in the city regulators, with an appeal to the City Council. The fact that no such cases have been heretofore in this court, is evidence that these matters have been lawfully settled elsewhere. It is no answer to such a law that it is unwise. That is for the legislature. But it is a wise law—absolutely necessary in cities. Even the error, if so common as this, would make the law. If this general construction given to the act should be restricted to the mere width of party walls, it would repeal the law; whereas the rule is to construe a remedial law so as to extend the remedy. It is against thé gramatical construction of the law. When a power is granted to a municipal corporation, all the incidents to execute it are The to fix\" the foundation, and regulate party walls includes the necessity of deciding where the lines are. If they have nothing to do but decide on the thickness of the walls, why go on the premises. § 7. Penalty for building contrary to regulation. It is not an ex parte proceeding. The regulators call for papers from both parties. There is an appeal; and full hearing may be had. Mr. Bayard. It might as well be contended that the fence viewers have the power to decide the title to land by regulating party fences, as to claim the power now claimed for city regulators. That a power to regulate party walls shall by inference embrace a power to determine titles, and dividing lines, and a municipal authority shall oust the Superior\\' Court of jurisdiction and exclude trial by jury, is a monstrous proposition, and all this without any \\'provision for notice, or for trial, or for evidence, or for deliberation. Two men, called out by one party, and paid by him, shall, from his papers, decide upon the title to my land. The authority given by law is not to settle boundaries, or titles, but io settle party walls or undisputed lines, when disputes arise about the necessary width of party walls and foundations, and the part of the walls on each side. If such a power is to be recognized what is to be the effect ? Take the present case as an illustration. Here are two houses standing for fifty years on a certain line; regulated no doubt at the time they were built; and now regulated again at the instance and by the papers of one party, and fourteen inches cut off from one of the houses. What is to prevent the next set of regulators from cutting off more, or cutting off less; and from thus pulling down houses every year. No record is made, and if made the act of regulators to-day, cannot bind others to-morrow, though an effect is claimed for it to control the legal rights of parties without hearing, trial, or judgment. If the legislature designed to give this dangerous power to regulators, they would have said so directly.',\n",

Negligence — Proximate and remote cause — Presumption. ^ The general -rule is that a man is answerable for the consequences of a fault which are natural and probable, and might therefore be foreseen by ordinary forecast, but an individual is not presumed to contemplate the coincidence of events having no probable or natural connection in the mind, and which cannot by ordinary thoughtfulness be foreseen as likely to happen in consequence of the act in which he is engaged. Where there has intervened between the defendant's act and the injury, an independent illegal act of a third person, or one induced by irresponsible agencies or trespassers, which produced the injury, and without which it would not have happened, and such act is held to be the approximate cause of the injury, the defendant is not liable. Where the effect of the evidence is merely to establish that there are two independent causes, either of which may have been the proximate cause of the injury, the burden is upon the plaintiff to show that the cause for which the defendant is responsible, was the one which produced the injury for which recovery is sought. The question of negligence is one of law for the court, only where the facts are such that all responsible minds must draw the same conclusions from them, but when the conclusion follows as a matter of law, that the plaintiff’s right to recover is not made out upon any view that can be properly taken of the facts the evidence tends to establish, it is the duty of the court to withdraw the case from the consideration of the jury and direct a verdict. Negligence — Fall of fence — Proximate and remote cause — Evidence—Question for court. In an action against the owner of a fence to recover damages for personal injuries caused by the fall of the fence, binding instructions for the defendant should be given to the jury where the uneontradicted evidence showed that the fall of the fence had been caused by a large crowd of trespassers climbing upon it, although warned to keep off, and that the fence although nine years old and with some of its parts rotten, did not give way under the pressure for over ten minutes. In such a case it is immaterial that on other occasions crowds had gathered on the fence, and that the owner had knowledge of this. Argued May 2, 1905.

It was alleged in the petition that appellee was in the peaceable possession of the house built by him on the ground leased for the term of eighteen months, and had occupied the house since the fourth day of April, 1883, as a restaurant and bar room; that appellants, “\\'with systematic and preconcerted malice,” .persecuted him, built a fence of plank nine feet high around and against his house, completely closing the en trance thereto; that at the instance and on the affidavit of Sinclair, he was arrested on a charge of violating the penal laws of the State, said prosecution being malicious and without probable cause, and taken from his house; that when arrested and taken away he left his son, of tender years, in charge of the house; that after he was arrested and taken away upon a false and frivolous charge, in pursuance of the plot to injure and oppress him, defendants, with others acting under them and by their directions, threw his son out of the house, tore down and demolisked the house, reducing it to a mass of rubbish, and carried it and all its contents away; that the value of the house so wantonly and maliciously destroyed and carried away was six hundred dollars; that the value of the goods and personal property so taken away was two hundred and eighty-three dollars and sixty-five cents, including thirty dollars in money; that he sustained damage by being out of employment five hundred dollars;_ that his feelings have been outraged by the destruction of his property and business and the insult and personal violence to his minor child. Prayer for actual damages as stated and twenty thousand dollars exemplary damages. The petition alleged many circumstances of aggravation. Defendants answered by general demurrer, general denial, not guilty, and special plea to the effect that Sinclair was president and Eavey superintendent of the Galveston City Eailroad Company, an incorporated body which owned and was in possession of the alleged leased premises of plaintiff at and prior to the alleged trespass, and that what they did was in pursuance of their duty to protect the company’s property from the wrongful intrusion thereon by plaintiff, effected secretly and fraudulently in the night time, and was in good faith, rightful and in pursuance of advice of counsel. Other pleadings were subsequently filed by the parties, not necessary t.o be specified here, and a jury trial had which resulted in a verdict, November 9,1886, for plaintiff for five hundred and sixty dollars and thirty-four cents actual, and two thousand dollars exemplary damages, and judgment in pursuance thereof- It was proved that \"Waul & Walker, as agents for Thatcher & Co., who claimed to own the lot on which appellee built his house, leased the lot to Stanley the latter part of March, 1883» for a term of eighteen months, Stanley paying one month’s rent. About April 2, Stanley moved lumber on the lot for the purpose of building a house, and was then notified that Sinclair objected to his building the house, but says he did not know that the City Railway Company claimed the lot. Sinclair, president of the company, caused the lumber to be carried away from the lot and left at another place in the city. Eavey was superintendent of the railway company. Stanley got other lumber, had the house framed at another place, and during the night of April 4, 1883, moved the material on the lot, erected his house, and Was occupying it, carrying on his business on the morning of the fifth of April. The lot was vacant, uninclosed. He took posses, sion under advice of counsel. There were some posts set around a part of out lot 114, of which lot 8, leased by Stanley, and on which he built the house, was a part. On the morning of the ninth of April, appellants caused a plank fence nine feet high to be erected around and against the house, closing the entrance, part of the fence being nailed to the house. This was done under advice of counsel to “ enclose the lot and take possession of it.” Stanley knocked a portion of the fence down, opening the entrance to the house. Sinclair made affidavit against Stanley* charging him with malicious mischief for breaking down the fence. Stanley was arrested and taken away from his house. He left his minor son in possession with instructions to remain until he returned. After Stanley was taken away, Eavey, with a force of men and teams, went to the house, got Stanley’s boy out in some way, tore down the house and removed the lumber and the contents of the house to another place in the city, and “piled it up by Thompson’s house.” Stanley’s son testified that Eavey took him by the neck and pants and threw him out of the house on the sand, hurting his arm a little. He attempted to go back in the house, but the timbers were falling and he remained out from fear he would be killed. Eavey testified that he did not put his hands on the boy, simply told him to go out, and he went. Ho other witness testified as to how the boy was gotten out of the house. Stanley testified that the house and contents were\"utterly destroyed, the house being knocked into fire wood. Eavey testified that they tore the house down in about ten minutes, and did it as carefully as they could. Sinclair told Stanley that he did not want any poor man with little shanty within ten blocks of his hotel. The evening the house was torn down it was proved that Sinclair said to Stanley: “They have pulled you down have they?” Stanley replied: “Yes, and I suppose you will pay for it,” when Sinclair told him it was a case between a rich corporation and a poor tax payer, and if he brought suit he would never get a cent, and be a poor man as long as he lived. The railroad track ran across a corner of the lot at the time the house was built on it. In January, 1884, Thatcher & Co. executed a power of attorney to Waul & Walker, ratifying the lease they had made to Stanley. After the previous judgment was rendered for plaintiff, he assigned it to Waul & Walker. And after the judgment was reversed, they reassigned and transferred the judgment back to Stanley. This was done about the time of the trial, and was set up by plaintiff in a trial amendment in reply to defendant’s allegations that Stanley had assigned and disposed of the cause of action. It was proved that .the assignment to Waul & Walker was a trust, to secure some of Stanley’s creditors. Thatcher & Co., had a connected chain of title to the lot, but one link was defective, and the railway company was adjudged to have the better title, and the court instructed the jury to that effect. On the trial defendant excepted to the following remarks made by counsel for plaintiff in his opening argument: “I have never had greater interest in any case with which I have been connected than I have in this case. My extreme interest in it is due to my knowledge of the poverty and suffering that have been entailed upon the plaintiff by the wrongful acts of the defendants.” Upon exception being made, the cppnsel stated to the court and jury that he withdrew the language and did not wish them to consider it. After the allowance of the bill on the foregoing exception, counsel for plaintiff used the following language in argument: “I hope now, gentlemen, I will be allowed to proceed. It seems that I never am to have opportunity to prosecute the suit to the end. I need make no remarks about the purpose of the management of this case by the other side. You can see that. You can understand what that means. I began my speech an hour ago, and it is not my fault that I have been interrupted in it and you have been detained so long.” To which counsel for defendants excepted. Both of these exceptions were upon the ground that the language was not authorized by the evidence and calculated to divert the jury from the issues in the case. After the lease to Stanley was introduced in evidence, plaintiff offered the power of attorney from Thatcher & Oo. to Waul & Walker, confirming and ratifying the lease, to which defendants objected for following reasons: 1. That it was executed long after the lease and after the alleged trespasses, and was incompetent to aid the title claimed by plaintiff under the lease. 2. That no evidence had been introduced showing any title in Thatcher & Co. to give the power. The court overruled the objections and admitted the power of attorney, and defendants excepted. After the evidence was closed, defendants moved the court to withdraw and exclude the power of attorney from the jury, for the reasons stated in the objections to it when offered, and because the evidence did not connect it with any title in Thatcher & Co. The motion being overruled, defendant excepted. On cross examination of plaintiff Stanley, defendant’s counsel propounded seven interrogatories to him in the following form: “Didn’t you testify on the former trial in effect as follows?” — and after each question counsel would read from the statement of facts made upon the former trial. To four of these questions plaintiff answered yes. To two of them, yes, with some qualification, and to one he answered no. During the course of the evidence on behalf of the defendants they offered to read to.the jury, for the purpose of contradicting or affecting the testimony of plaintiff on his direct examination, the passages from the statement of facts used by counsel in connection with the questions asked Stanley on cross examination, and counsel for plaintiff objected, because inadmissible and incompetent, and the court sustained the objection, to which appellants excepted. F. Charles Hume, for appellants: It appearing from plaintiff’s trial amendment that his title to recover was derived from an assignment made to him by others after the reversal of the judgment by the Supreme Court, and the defendants having no notice prior to the filing of the trial amendment of any claim against them by him as assignee or otherwise as alleged in his original petition, plaintiff could not lawfully proceed to judgment over defendant’s exceptions for want of process advising them of his suit as such assignee.

Present: Rugg, C.J., Beamy, DeCourcy, & Jennet, JJ. Equity Pleading and Practice, Answer. Rules of Court, Equity Rule 7. Equity Jurisdiction, Reformation of deed, Mistake, Bona fide purchaser. Contract, Construction. Evidence, Of boundary. Husband and Wife. Agency, Existence of relation. An answer to a bill in equity, which neither admits nor denies the allegations in a paragraph of the bill but merely purports to leave the plaintiff to prove the same, is improper. Statement by Jennet, J., of the requirements of an answer to a bill in equity as established by Equity Rule 7 and the decisions of this court. In a suit in equity by the owner of land in a city against a husband and his wife, owners as tenants by the entirety of an adjoining parcel, and against the common grantor of the two parcels, the plaintiff alleged that by mistake a strip of land between the parcels which should have been conveyed to him was omitted from his deed and was conveyed to the defendant grantees, and he sought reformation of the deeds to rectify the mistake\". The following facts were found by a master: The premises comprising the two parcels originally were shown as adjoining lots upon a recorded plan. Predecessors in title to the common grantor erected two tenement houses upon the entire parcel in disregard of the position of the dividing line of the lots shown on the recorded plan, and built an asphalt walk for use exclusively in connection with the building finally conveyed to the plaintiff and also a strong and permanent wire fence outside of the walk, both of which overlapped the boundary line on the recorded plan. When the plaintiff purchased the property, he was shown the fence and the walk and was told that they constituted the boundaries of the land to be purchased. Previous to the conveyance of the adjoining parcel, the defendant wife inspected the premises, saw the fence and the walk, and knew their purpose and use. An agreement in writing preceding the sale to the defendant grantees provided for a conveyance of “ a certain estate . . .\\'[giving its number on a street] the same to contain 5,000 square feet of land more or less with the building thereon.” There was no evidence that quantity of land was an essential element of the bargain. By mistakes of the scriveners, the deeds given to the plaintiff and to the defendant grantees, respectively, followed the boundary line as shown on the recorded plan. Held, that (1) A finding of a mutual mistake justifying a decree reforming the deed to the plaintiff as against his grantor was warranted; (2) The subsidiary facts found warranted a finding of a mutual mistake in the deed by the common grantor to the defendant grantees; (3) In the circumstances, the mistake in the deed to the defendant grantees undermined and destroyed the effect of their status as bona fide purchasers and left them subject to the superior equitable right of the plaintiff, since it would be inequitable to allow purchasers in their position to reap the harvest of a bargain which they never intended to make; (4) A finding was warranted by way of inference that the defendant wife in inspecting the premises before the sale acted not only for herself but in behalf of her husband; (5) The agreement for sale to the defendants included only the estate by number on the street with the building thereon and, properly construed, embraced only the property so known, and that reasonably required for the purposes for which the .buildings were occupied or fitted for occupancy; (6) The description, in the agreement for the sale of the premises to the defendant grantees, of the area of the parcel to be conveyed as “ 5,000 square feet of land more or less ” did not enlarge the construction of the agreement; (7) It was not reversible error for the master to admit evidence that the predecessor in title of the common grantor, who had erected the fence between the premises, described it as “ the dividing line between these two pieces of property.” Bill in equity, filed in the Supreme Judicial Court on May 4, 1921, by Louisa A. Burke, the owner of a parcel of land at the corner of Chestnut Avenue and Paul Gore Street in that part of Boston called Jamaica Plain, her husband, .Joseph F. Burke, and Mt. Washington Cooperative Bank, a mortgagee thereof, against William Murray and Julia E. Murray, husband and wife, owners as tenants by the entirety of an adjoining parcel, Roxbury Cooperative Bank, mortgagee of such adjoining parcel, and the heirs of Patrick McLaughlin, common grantors of both parcels, in which the plaintiffs alleged in substance that by mutual mistakes of all parties the deeds to the plaintiffs and to the Murrays and from them to the respective mortgagees did not describe the land intended to be conveyed, in that there was omitted from the Burke deeds and included in the Murray deeds a strip of land between the parcels. The prayers were for reformation of all of the deeds. Also, a Bill in equity filed in the same court on May 9, 1921, by the Murrays against Louisa A. Burke and her mortgagee for an injunction to compel the removal of so much of her building as intruded upon the strip of land in dispute and to restrain her from trespassing thereon. The statute of frauds was not pleaded. The two suits were referred to a master and were ordered to be tried together. It appeared that the agreement for a sale to the Murrays was of “ a certain estate situated in that part of Boston called Jamaica Plain and numbered 139 Chestnut Ave. — the same to contain 5000 square feet of land more or less with the building thereon.” Other material findings by the master are described in the opinion. The Murrays excepted to the master’s report on the following grounds: “ 1. For the reason that it states ‘ that in connection with the sales of these two parcels to the Murrays and Burkes there was a mutual mistake of the parties.’ And it appears by the facts found that the title was taken to the house 139 Chestnut Avenue to William Murray and Julia E. Murray, wife of said William, as tenants by the entirety; and it also appears by the facts found that William Murray, one of the purchasers, examined the property only once, in the evening, seeing the place from the outside, going into a certain portion of the house, but making no examination of the yard, and that the matter of the wire fence referred to in the master’s report was never called to his attention; and that the conclusion of the master, as above stated, in regard to a mutual mistake does not differentiate, as it should, between the situation of William Murray and the situation of Julia E. Murray. “ 2. For the reason that it states that‘ on the facts found as above my conclusion is that in connection with the sales of these two parcels to the Murrays and Burkes there was a mutual mistake of the parties whereby the property undertaken to be conveyed to them by their respective deeds was erroneously described therein. And I so find.’ That all the facts warranting this statement by the master have been fully set forth as findings in the earlier portion of the report and that this statement by the master is a finding on a rule of law, which he is not authorized to make, and not a finding of fact. “ 3. For the reason that it is founded in part, and largely, on the evidence as to what Patrick McLaughlin, long since deceased, regarded as the dividing line; and it appears in other portions of the report that the Murrays never knew Patrick McLaughlin and had no knowledge of his opinion as to the dividing line, and that they, as purchasers, are to be deprived of their purchase because of the private opinion of a deceased person in regard to that deceased person’s property, of which they had no knowledge. “4. For the reason that the master has purposely omitted the facts set forth in the evidence, and uncontroverted, that when Murray took title he examined the deed to see if there were five thousand feet conveyed to him and the lawyers got some book in the registry with a plan showing lot 26 with five thousand feet, which he examined before he paid his money, and the master has omitted this evidence after it was called to his attention, apparently for the purpose of making his report stronger in favor of the Burkes, and the parties filing these objections are entitled to have it inserted. “ 5. On the ground that the master has omitted from his report reference to the fact that the edge of the granolithic walk nearest the Murray house was shown as one part of the dividing line, and his report omits material facts favorable to the Murrays. “6. For the reason that the statement that Mrs. Murray admitted on the stand that she was not interested in the number of square feet in the lot, but only in the house, etc. is an unfair statement of her evidence.” The exceptions were heard by Pierce, J., by whose order there were entered interlocutory decrees overruling the exceptions and confirming the report and final decrees, ordering the reformation of the deeds as sought in the first suit, and dismissing the second suit. The Murrays appealed. S. C. Brackett, for the Murrays. J. M. Hoy, (J. E. Reagan & A. A. Gelinas with him,) for the Burkes.',\n",

(1) Adjoining owners- of land may agree upon the division line between their premises and each owns up to the agreed line as fully as if it were a natural boundary or their respective deeds called for it. If the agreement is proved according to the rules of law governing it. and if possession has been held nnder snch agreement for the period prescribed by the statutes, the law will not suffer it. to be disturbed, even though there was no agreement in the beginning.

(2) \"Where one of two joint land proprietors takes, and holds possession up to a fence which he supposes is on the true line, claiming to the fence, his possession is adverse as to all lands within his inclosure. In such case it makes no difference that he was mistaken as to the location of the true line, nor does it make any difference that he did not intend to invade his. neighbor’s rights. The fact that he claims to the fence, not simply to -the line when asr\\' certained, is sufficient and will constitute disseisin. The burden of bringing the case within the exceptions, to the rule of a possession for the period of limitation not being adverse between adjoining owners. because always held subject to a subsequent ascertainment of the true line is on the party claiming that the posses sion was not adverse, and such, party must clearly show the existence of snch qualified claim to possession at some time prior to a ripening of title by limitation.

(3) The evidence elicited on cross-examination by respondent of witness Ulfers with reference to the manner of the survey made by Biglow, is wholly immaterial and prejudicial to the appellant, for the reason that it is wholly immaterial whether Biglow surveyed the boundary line between the .respective grantors of appellant and respondent correctly and located the correct or true division line between their respective adjoining lands on .the question as to whether or not there was a prior- agreement between Hyronimous Ul-fers and Rudolph Dennert, Sr., grantors, respectively, of appellant and respondent, to abide by the line established by the survey of Bigelow.

Real Property — Possession—Presumption. The presumption of law is that possession of real property is in harmony with the rights of the true owner, and before any rights based upon possession or occupancy can extinguish that legal right, it must be shown, among other things, that it was antagonistic. An antagonistic or adverse use of a right of way cannot spring from a permissive use. 2. Easement — Prescription. A permissive use of a way over another’s land will never ripen into an easement by prescription, no matter for how long a time it may have been enjoyed. 3. Permission. An owner of land is not shorn of any of his rights by merely permitting another to pass over his land, and where there is no inconsistency between such permissive use and the ownership, there can be no prescriptive right.

Where a deed bounds the property conveyed on a public highway, on a question of boundary the return of the surveyors laying out such highway is competent evidence without showing their appointment, or if the proceedings of their appointment are void; the only question is, where is the highway, not whether it is legally laid out. 2. If the language of a deed leaves it doubtful which of two boundaries it calls for, the practical construction given to it by the parties themselves in taking possession is competent evidence to show where the line is. 3. Where a line is not settled, acquiescence by tlie parties concerned, without a positive agreement and for a less period than twenty years, will fix the boundary. 4. Where no doubt would arise as to the true location of a lot from the construction of the grant, yet if the grantee, by his acts in locating his lot, has fixed his lines differently, and induced others to act upon such erroneous location, he will be bound by such location, and will by his acquiescence be prevented from disputing the boundaries thus fixed, although such acquiescence be only for a year. 5. .If a deed calls for only one monument, and that is the corner of two streets as its beginning point, and these streets are laid out, but not opened and fenced off, then the beginning point called for is the mathematical point designated in the surveys ; but if the streets had been opened, and the corner built upon, and thus ascertained, it would properly and more naturally refer to such actual corner. _ Rule to show fcause. This was an action of ejectment tried before Mr. Justice Whitehead, at the Passaic circuit, in March, 1847, when a verdict was found for the plaintiff. The land sought to be recovered was a strip in dispute between the owners of two adjoining lots, in the township of Paterson, in said county : the lessor of the plaintiff claimed that his lot went to a liue ten feet east of that claimed and occupied by the defendant. On the trial- it appeared in evidence that both parties held adjoining lots under the same title. In 1831, Messieurs Collet and Pennington, having purchased certain land in or adjoining to the town of Paterson, divided it into lots, for the purpose of sale, and caused a map to be made of the same, which map was given in evidence. The lot of the lessor of the plaintiff, beginning at the northeast corner of High and Willis streets, being sixty-nine on Willis, and running north one hundred feet on the easterly side of High street, was sold by Collet and PeDnington to one Weight, by deed dated 17th December, 1835, under whom the plaintiff held by subsequent conveyance. The defendant’s lot adjoined the easterly side of the lot of the plaintiff, being 25 feet on Willis, and 100 feet in depth. These lots, with others, were sold in conformity wit-h the map so made by Collet and Pennington, and there was evidence to show that they were located according to the present occupation, and on the supposition that a fence on the westerly side of the plaintiff’s lot was the boundary, or easterly side of High street. The case of the plaintiff proceeded on' the ground that the true easterly line of that street was ten feet farther east than that fence, and that his lot should be located accordingly, to which he insisted the lots adjoining should conform. Under this view, the plaintiff claimed ten feet off of the lot of the defendant, as now occupied by him, and, as the defendant alleged, it had been occupied since the sale by Collet and Pennington. The plaintiff' offered and read in evidence the return of High street, as laid out in 1821, which was objected to by the defendant, upon grounds not now necessary to notice. The road in the return called for a course of south 3° east (but which appeared to be a mistake for south 3° west), and was laid three rods wide. There was evidence to show that if run, according to the return, in a straight line, and of the width called for, the easterly side of the street would be ten feet within the fence on the westerly side of the plaintiff’s lot, which true line of the street the plaintiff insisted showed the commencement of his lot. The defendant, on the contrary, insisted on the trial, that the line had been fixed for twenty-six years, the lots sold built upon according to a location then made, and that the line could not now bo altered, even if the true line of the street should be shown to be otherwise than then supposed. The judge in substance charged the jury, that the fence, being on the same line as when the location of these lots was first made by Collet and Pennington, and having been recognised as the line of the street and the westerly side of plaintiff’s lot, must now be held as the line; that the public had acquiesced ; that parties had bought and sold on the supposition that the fence was the line, and that it must be so held in the present controversy. Notwithstanding the charge of the judge, the jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiff. A rule was taken to show cause why that verdict should not be set aside, and a new trial granted.

       "  'case_summary': \"[Civ. No. 1424. Second Appellate District. January 9, 1914.] W. H. ROBINSON et al., Respondents, v. JAMES B. BLEDSOE, Appellant. Tenancy in Common—Acquisition of Adverse Title—Tenant as Trustee.—As a general rule a tenant in common, occupying, as he is presumed to, relations of trust and confidence toward his co-tenants, may not acquire an adverse title to that under which possession of the property is held, without being charged as a trustee in the holding thereof for the joint benefit of the cotenancy; 'but the relation of cotenants is not necessarily so intimate as to preclude one of them from acquiring and asserting am adverse claim 'against the others. Id.—Existence of Tenancy in Common—Color of Title and Assertion of Claim.—In order that a tenancy in common may exist between parties in the holding of land, it is necessary that they possess some color of title and assert their claim in some tangible way. Id.—State Land—Possessory Bight—Character of Possession.— Under section 1006 of the Civil Code, a possessory right to state lands may be acquired which will be sufficient against all except the sovereignty. But this right must be evidenced by actual possession, for there can be no constructive possession in such a ease. Id.—Actual Possession—What Constitutes—Notice of Claim.— By actual possession is meant a subjection to the will and dominion of the claimant. It is usually evidenced by occupation, by a substantial inclosure, by cultivation, or by appropriate use, according to the particular locality and quality of the property. The acts and things done must be of such a nature as to give notice to the public of the claim. Id.—Desert Land Used by Cattlemen—Title Acquired by One not Held in Trust for Others.—Where, after a number of cattlemen have for years used a large tract of desert land for grazing, one of their number purchases a part of the land from the state, the others who have never asserted, or attempted in any way to give notice, that they claimed the right to the possession of any particular lands, except thirty acres thereof, cannot maintain an action to have it declared that the purchaser holds the land in trust for them as tenants in common. Id.—Exclusion of Cotenant—Bight to Consider Tenancy at End.— If the plaintiffs in such action fenced thirty acres of the tract, and excluded the defendant therefrom because of his refusal to pay his ■proportion of the cost of the fence, this entitled him to treat the assumed cotenancy, if any existed us to that ground, as at an end. Id.—Improvements—-Failure op Cotenant to Make Contribution— ■Summary Remedy Against Him'.—There is no right in eotenants, who make improvements on the common property, to seize the property of a non-contributing member and so summarily work out their remedy for his failure to contribute to the cost of improvements made with- his consent. Id.—Possession op Common Property—Equal Rights op Cotenants.'—To constitute a tenancy in common there must be an equal right to the possession of every part and parcel of the subject • matter of the tenancy. APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of San Bernardino County and from an order refusing a new trial. Frank F. Oster, Judge. The facts are stated in the opinion of the court. R. E.

A parol gift of land from a father to his son-in-law and daughter is empt from the operation of the Statute of Frauds when in pursuance of said \"t possession is taken and valuable improvements made, and a fortiori, when \\'tne possession has boon undisturbed for a great length of time, or the improvements have added largely to the value of the property. May 10th 1877. Before Agnew, O. J., Sharswood, Mercur, Gordon, Paxson, Woodward and Sterrett, JJ. Error to the Court of Common Pleas of York county: Of May Term 1877, No. 188. Ejectment by the administrator of George Sower against Henry Weaver for a tract of sixty-four acres of land. Weaver is the son-in-law of Sower. The case was originally tried January 26th 1876, and the verdict was for the defendant. A writ of error was taken by the plaintiff and the judgment of the lower court reversed (see report of case in 28 P. E. Smith 448). On the 26th of August 1876 George Sower made his will, wherein \\'he appointed hip son John his executor. The testator died on the 6th of June 1876, and his son John on the 10th of the same month. Letters of administration, c. t. a., were granted to John S. Deardorff, on the 21st of June 1876, and he was substituted as plaintiff in the suit. The cause again came on for trial on the 7th of January 1877, before Eisher, P. J. On behalf of the plaintiff evidence was then given of the legal title to one hundred and fifty acres of land, of which the sixty-four in dispute formed a part. George Sower was quite aged and infirm, and his deposition was read, wherein he deposed in answer to a question how Weaver came into possession of this land:— “ He held on for a home; then I proposed I would build him a house on it; he was at this time married to my daughter; I said to him I did build a house on it, and told him he might have it for eighteen years, and might have all he raised on it. That was about twenty-six years ago, and he was to pay all the taxes on it, and build a barn on it; he agreed to that; our bargain was just by words; he took possession of it, after we made that bargain; in about two or three months after the bargain he went into possession ; the house that I built there, was built on it before he went into ■possession; he built a barn on it; but I had to. pay the most of it, his credit wasn’t present; he staid there the eighteen years; he had the income of it during that time, and paid the taxes on it; when the eighteen years were up then, they complained that I had given the boys homes and they had nothing — that is, Elizabeth and her husband; then I proposed to them to give it to them, as I had given land to the boys too — that is, at the township rates, what it was assessed at- by the assessor; they were both together, Weaver and his wife, when I said this; it was in their house where they were living ; they didn’t make me much of an answer to it, and I told them they should consider it; all Henry Weaver said was, he’d like to have it for his own, but he couldn’t take it; there was no more said about it, at that time; I had no conversation with him about it after that. I said to Weaver he must now pay me rent, either the third bushel or fifty dollars; he made no answer, hung his head and said not a word ; I demanded rent several times up at his house, and several times here in the kitchen; he never said a word in answer; it’s a little better than nineteen years now since I sold the Mine Bank school-house lot off of it; he was living in there where he is now living, there on the land ; of course he knew at the time I sold that lot off; he was present and helped to measure it off; I got the money for the school-house lot; I know Henry Weaver has sent his children to school there; Weaver built nothing except the barn; he fenced and improved and limed it a very little. ’ ’ There was other evidence for plaintiff of a similar tendency. It was also in evidence that in 1853 George Sower had conveyed forty perches of the land, part of that occupied by defendant, to the Washington School District, to which conveyance it appeared defendant assented. The defence alleged a parol gift from George Sower to Weaver and his wife, and gave evidence thereof, as follows:— Elizabeth Weaver, the daughter of George Sower, testified: “If I live till the 25th of February I will be sixty-one years old; I live with my husband on the land in dispute; I married Henry Weaver thirty-four years ago; father said he would divide the farm where John lived on, and build a house if we would go on; I told him I did not want to go there, I could not be at home, and he told me he would build a house on it, and if I was there once and had my stuff there I would be at home; I told him the land was too poor, we could not live on it; he said I could make it good; we went on the land; there was no house on the land at the time he gave me the land; my father helped to build the house; he got the carpenter work of the house done; Weaver, my husband, got the other part of the work done; he dug the cellar and had all the mason work done which was done to the house; we moved in on Whit-Monday of 1846 ; Weaver put up the barn in 1846; we have been living there ever since; when we went there the land was as poor as could be. We could not have lived upon what the land produced at that time; I do not know that George Sower did anything towards building the barn; Weaver employed the workmen to build the barn and paid them ; he paid taxes on the land; made fences; put lime on it; all the manure that we raised he put on; one year he got guano to put on the ground; there is an orchard there — we planted the trees; garden there; Weaver laid out the garden and we fenced it — it is a clap-board fence; we planted fruit trees, apples, peaches, pears, plums, grapes and quinces; we dug the well; nothing more said than I have stated here before we took possession; I never asked him for a piece of land to build a house on; father never said how long we should live there; never demanded any rent or said we should give him any share during the time we lived there; I know they found ore on this land two years this last summer; I did not come to my father eighteen years after we went into possession and complain that the rest had homes and we had none, nor did my husband and myself go at the end of eighteen years; nor did he offer to give it to us at the rate it was assessed for taxation in the township ; nor did he come at\\'that time to our house and make such a proposition; when the school-house was about being built, father came to our house and asked whether we were willing the school-house should be built on that corner, and whether we were willing to give the land; we said we were willing, it would be so handy to send the children to school; I was never present when my father demanded rent from Weaver.” Henry Weaver testified: “In 1845, before I went on this land, George Sower and I went to look at it; I went up with him to look at the place to put the buildings; I said it is hard for me to build there unless I know what I was to do it for; he said he did give it to me and my wife for our own, and with that understanding I went into possession; then, in pursuance of that conversation, I dug the cellar and took possession, and put up the barn, and put up the garden fence, and made fence to keep the cattle out, and did work, and had more than I could do.” George Slyder testified: “ I know Henry Weaver and George Sower, the parties to this suit; my mother lived, in 1845, in the fall, in Washington township; then I lived there; I was at my mother’s, and Weaver was making fine wood for her; old Sower came there, and then the assessor, Jacob Gentzler, came; this was in the fall of 1845; the assessor asked the old man, how about that farm — should he assess it in his name; ‘No,’ said he, ‘ I gave it to Henry and his wife; they can do with it now what they please.’ ” John Braugher testified: “At the time they were building the barn I had a conversation with George Sower about this property ; he told me he had divided his property, and the big part he gave to John, ‘ and this small part I gave Betsey Weaver; I am going to build this house on it, and whenever the house is finished once Weaver may move in it; then he may fix it up to suit himself, and all he makes on it is his; then to fall to Weaver’s heirs after his death;’ after that Weaver did build a bam on the property; we paled the garden.” George S. Harbolt testified: “I know George Sower; about twelve or fifteen years ago I had a conversation with him; he told me that he had given that part of the farm to Henry Weaver and his wife, as part of her legacy.” Peter Benedict testified: “ I know George Sower and Henry Weaver; I had a conversation with George Sower in relation to this action about a year ago ; I was collecting tax for fire insurance for Henry Weaver; I went to Sower for the tax ; I asked him what was the reason that him and Henry Weaver and his daughter could not settle the tax; he told me then that when Henry Weaver found out this ore, that Barbara and John told him he should chase Henry Weaver from this farm; that he went to Henry Weaver then; Weaver said he would not go off, and Barbara and John said he should get the sheriff and throw him out; then he said he had no rest until he sent the sheriff and went on with the lawsuit; Barbara and John were the cause of his having no rest, and the ore-bank on Henry Weaver’s land; during this conversation he told me he did give this land to Henry Weaver and his wife Betsey.” Daniel Baker testified: “I know George Sower; had conversation with him in relation to the property; he told me how he divided his land amongst his children; how he helped John to the Harbolt farm, and George Sower he gave or sold the piece I live on; he said he gave Betsey the piece Henry Weaver lives on, who can do with that what he pleased.” Solomon Gross testified: “ I farmed George Sower’s land; he told me he gave land to Betsey; I was assessor over twenty years ago; I asked old George Sower in whose name it was to be assessed, whether in his name; he said no, I should assess it in Henry Weaver’s name; he said he had nothing to do with that land; he said it belonged to Henry Weaver and his wife; I assessed it in Henry Weaver’s name, and he paid me the taxes for it.” Jacob Lichty testified: “I know George Sower well; I had a conversation with him about the land Weaver lived on; I met him at Raffensberger’s\\' about the time Weaver was. building his house; I said to Sower, ‘You are going to build there1;’ he said, ‘Yes, I have divided my land now; I have given the old stand to John now, and the other part to Henry Weaver, and they shall build on it, and then it shall be theirs, and then they have their own;’ then he said, ‘they will not have to pay any rent any more.’ ” James Marshall testified: “ I had a conversation with George Sower; I asked Sower if the property was Henry Weaver’s or not; he said he gave his daughter Elizabeth, Weaver’s wife, the piece of land, and to his children, and he had nothing to do with it.” David Myers testified: “I was the assessor in 1846; Jacob Kochenour and George Sower were the assistant assessors that year; we assessed the farm; Sower was present; we assessed it in Weaver’s name; ‘This,’ he said, ‘assess to Weaver-; I gave it to Betz;’ I was the assessor after that, but cannot tell the years; may be fifteen years after that; Henry Weaver paid me the road tax.” Other testimony on this subject tended to corroborate the gift. That the property had been improved by the defendant was proved by the testimony of several witnesses, who also testified to the value of the buildings and other improvements. George Sower was examined a second time on a rule to take testimony. He swore positively that he did not hear the conversation testified to by Elizabeth Weaver, about the giving of the land to her and her husband. To the various questions asked, he answered, “Not a word of it is true,” as “nothing of the kind was said.” He also denied that he had the conversations with the parties who testified as above. The plaintiff’s 4th and 5th points, together with the answers of the court, were as follows:— 4. That the defence in this case is an equitable one, and the evidence to sustain it must, to be available, be so direct, positive, express and unambiguous as to induce a chancellor to decree a conveyance; that a chancellor must look at the whole evidence in the case; that the whole evidence in this case leaves the alleged equity of the defendant in too great doubt and uncertainty to justify such a decree; and upon the whole evidence in the case the plaintiff is entitled to recover. Answer. “ We affirm the first part of this point; but we cannot say to the jury that the whole evidence in this case is in too great doubt to justify a decree; it is for them to say what part of the evidence is true and what false; and if they disbelieve the testimony of George Sower and believe the testimony of the witnesses offered to prove the gift, the evidence is sufficient to prove a parol gift and possession under the gift, and that valuable improvements were made by the defendant in pursuance of the gift.” 5. That it is an undisputed fact in the case that in September 1858 (more than seven years after defendant was in possession under the alleged gift), George Sower the original plaintiff sold and conveyed a portion of the land embraced in said alleged gift to the Mine Bank School District and received the consideration for the same with the knowledge of, and without objection by, the defendant or his wife, and is inconsistent with and contradicts the inference of a parol gift, and of itself renders such alleged gift invalid, and plaintiff is entitled to the verdict of the jury. Answer. “ If the facts are as stated in the point it is correct, and we affirm it. But if the facts are as stated by Mrs. Weaver in her testimony that ‘when the school-house was about being built George Sower came to our house and asked whether we were willing that the school-house should be built on that corner and whether we would be willing to give the land, we said we were willing, it would be handy to send our children to schoolthis agreement to sell the lot is not a fact that contradicts a parol gift, but it is a circumstance to be taken into consideration by the jury in determining whether there was or was not a parol gift.” The court, inter alia, charged:— “ Under the decision of the Supreme Court in the present case, the testimony of a husband and wife is not to be considered as two witnesses, and the gift must be proved by another witness besides the husband and wife, and that has been done if the jury believed the testimony of the witnesses for the defendant.” The verdict was for the defendant, and after judgment the plaintiff took this writ, assigning for error the admission of the foregoing evidence, the answers to the points and the portion of the charge quoted. Chapman Fisher, for plaintiff in error. The rulings of the court cannot be sustained without overturning Ackerman v. Fisher, 7 P. F. Smith 457; Poorman v. Kilgore, 2 Casey 365; Harris v. Richey, 6 P. F. Smith 395, and a long line of other cases. The evidence in support of the defendant’s equity was insufficient to establish the parol gift, and the case should not have been submitted to the jury: Shellhammer v. Ashbaugh, 2 Norris 24. Greorge W. McFlroy and John Cfibson, for defendant in error. This parol gift of lands, accompanied as it was by possession and followed by valuable inprovements, is valid: Syler v. Eckhart, 1 Binn. 378; Postlethwait v. Frease, 7 Casey 474; Moore v. Small, 7 Harris 468; Eckert v. Eckert, 3 P. & W. 362; Hugus v. Walker, 2 Jones 174; Collins v. Collins, 2 Grant 117; Stewart v. Stewart, 3 Watts 253; Wack v. Sorber, 2 Whart. 387. We claim to have proved a gift executed, possession in pursuance of it, and improvements adding to the permanent value of the land from year to year, by encouragement of the donor, and occupied in such manner and such peaceable and uninterrupted possession as would make it against equity and good conscience to enforce the rule of the statute against the donee. In the cases of Aitkin v. Young, 2 Jones 15; Reed v. Reed, Id. 117; Hugus v. Walker, Id. 173, proof of title by parol was, left to the jury — whether there was a contract and possession in pursuance of a contract. October 1st 1877.',\n",

       "  'case_summary': 'Eberhard Klein v. Elizabeth Gehrung. The doctrine of ancient lights is not much relished in this country, owing to the rapid changes and improvements in our cities and villages. The modern English doctrine of a prescriptive right to prevent obstructions to window lights, adopted in analogy to the statute of limitations, is an anomaly in the law, and not adapted to the circumstances or existing state of things in this country, Most of the cases on the subject we have been considering relate to ways, commons, markets, water-courses, and the like, where the user or enjoyment, if not rightful, has been an immediate and continuing injury to the person against whom the presumption is made. If one commit a daily trespass on the land of another, under a claim of right to pass over, or feed his cattle upon it, or divert thé water from his mill, or throw it back upon his land or machinery; in these and the like cases, long-continued acquiescence affords strong presumptive evidence of right. But in the case of lights, there is no adverse user; nor, indeed, any use whatever of another’s property; and no foundation is laid for underlying any presumption against the rightful owner. When one builds upon his own land, immediately adjoining the land of another person, and puts out windows overlooking that neighbor’s land, he does no more than exercise a legal right. By the exercise of a legal right he can make no encroachment upon the rights of his neighbor, and cannot thereby impose any servitude or acquire any easement by the exercise of such a right for any length of time. It seems that, to constitute an adverse enjoyment of an incorporeal hereditament, the act of enjoyment must be of such a character as to afford ground for an action by the other party. It must be either an invasion of his vested rights, or else consequently injurious to their free exercise. The foundation of prescriptive title is the presumed grant of the party whose rights are adversely affected; but where it appears that the enjoyment has existed by the consent or license of such party, no presumption of grant can be made. By the common law, a prescriptive right to prevent the adjacent proprietor from inclosing or building upon his own land cannot be acquired by the use of an adjoining house, having windows looking out upon his land and receiving light and air from that direction, for a period of ten years. Appeal from Comal. The case was tried before Hon. Thomas J. Devine, one of the district judges. This case was brought by Klein before the District Court by certiorari. G-ehrung sued Klein before a justice of the peace, to compel him to remove his fence, built on his own land, in the city of Hew Braunfels, because it obstructed her windows; and for damages for the obstruction the case was tried. The house of Gehrung was built in 1845 or 1846, with windows overlooking Klein’s lot, thus affording the uninterrupted use of light and air, until Klein erected his fence, in December, 1857. The fence being ten feet high, and near the windows, obstructed the light, and damaged the property at least $25. There were many other immaterial facts; but the above presented the only question decided. The effect of the judge’s charge was, that ten years’ unobstructed\" use of the windows gave the prescriptive right to look out upon her neighbor’s land; and that for. the adjoining proprietor to obstruct her light, by building on his own land, was a trespass; that is, if he had acquiesced in her right for ten years. Verdict and judgment against Klein, from which he appealed. Jacob Waelder, for the appellant. —1. The justice had no jurisdiction to try the question of a servitude. 2. It is true, that the English rule on the subject of “ancient lights” has been followed by several of the older States. By others it has been repudiated, for reasons, too, that seem peculiarly applicable to the condition of the towns of this State. The English rule, derived from the civil law, may do very well for an old, settled country; it may answer a good purpose in such places as the city of London; but its adaptability to a countiy like this is an entirely different question. In 2 Greenl. on Ev., § 539a, the following language is used: “It seems that to constitute an adverse enjoyment of an incorporeal hereditament, the act of enjoyment must be of such a character as.to afford ground for an action by the other party. It must be either a direct invasion of his vested rights, or else consequently injurious to their free exercise. * * * * Thus, in the case of lights, if the building in which they are made is erected on the party’s own land, and no building stands on the land of the adjoining proprietor, it has been held, that against the latter no right is acquired by lapse of time.” The case of Pierre v. Fernald, 13 Shepl., 436, is here referred to; also Parker v. Foote, 19 Wend., 316. The rule laid down in the case of Parker v. Foote was also declared in Alabama in the case of Ray v. Lines, 10 Ala. R., 63. “B.ut the doctrine (of ancient lights) is not much relished in this country, owing to the rapid changes and improvements in our cities and villages.” (3 Kent’s Com., 448.) The same author, in a subsequent part of his work, (p. 449,) speaks approvingly of the rule laid down in the case of Parker v. Foote, 19 Wend., 316. Li Connecticut it is declared by statute, that a right to light cannot be acquired by prescription. (Rev. Stat. 1849, tit. 29, ch. 1, § 18.) 3. The court erred in refusing to give to the jury the special charge asked by defendant. The appellant believes that the District Court clearly erred in refusing to give this instruction. “In order that the enjoyment of an easement in another’s land may be conclusive of the right, it must have been adverse, that is, under a claim of title, with the knowledge and acquiescence of the owner of the land, and uninterrupted; and the burden of proving this is on the party claiming the easement. If he leaves it doubtful whether the enjoyment was adverse, known to the owner, and uninterrupted, it is not conclusive in his favor.” (2 Greenl. on Ev., § 539; Sargent v. Ballard, 9 Pick., 251; Davies v. Stephens, 7 C. and P., 570; Jarvis v. Dean, 3 Bing, 447.) 4. [Mr. Waelder copied the opinions quoted by him at great length. But as the chief justice exhausted them, the long citations have been omitted; also the long argument on the last point.] Has the enjoyment of the windows been adverse, under a claim or assertion of right, as some of the authorities require? (Barker v. Richardson, B. & Ald., 579; Hill v. Crosby, 2 Pick., 466; Bolivar Co. v. Neponset Co., 16 Pick., 241; Chalker v. Dickinson, 1 Conn., 382.) Campbell ¿f- Smith, for appellee. —It is respectfully submitted, that there is nothing in the first assignment. Justices of the peace have jiu\\'isdiction of all suits for injuries to any kind of property wherein the damages claimed do not exceed $100, and the power to award and decree the appropriate relief ^must follow of course. The relief \\'prayed for, in this case is not materially \"different from the decrees necessary in suits for the recovery of specific articles, to determine the right of property, or to restore detained premises; in all of which justices of the peace are competent to decree the appropriate relief. The doctrine declared in the decision upon which appellant seems to rely, (13 Shepl., 436,) viz, that a person, by the exercise of a lawful right, cannot be guilty of an encroachment upon others’ rights, cannot be sound. Under such a conception of the exercise of legal rights, it would be lawful for any person to erect a powder or any kind of manufactory upon any lot he may own, regardless of the character or quality of the improvements upon the adjoining ones, and yet be not guilty of an encroachment upon Ms neighbor’s rights. Such cannot be the law in any civilized community, for it would authorize and tolerate the most pernicious consequences. Under such a rule, lot-owners in towns and cities must make their improvements under the risk of having them rendered wholly useless in case the adjoining lots are vacant, and their owners think ’ proper to erect anytMng upon them that will be incompatible with the proper and intended use and enjoyment of their improvements. The sound maxim, that every person must so use his property as not to injure another’s, had better not be departed, from. The inconvenience arising from an adherence to it will be much less injurious in operation than that arising from its abandonment. In the occupancy and enjoyment of real property some security must be extended by law to priority of appropriation, otherwise the consequences above intimated are certain to follow, as in the case under consideration. TJpon this subject Kent says, on page 448, volume 3: “The elements of light and air are rights or incidents attached to the enjoyment of real estate, and the law gives weight and effect to the first appropriation of them. * * * If I build my house close to my neighbor’s wall, I cannot compel him to demolish it, though it may obstruct my light, for the first occupancy is in him. But, on the other hand, the owner of a house will be restrained by injunction, and be hable to an action\\' on the case, if he make any erections or improvements so as to obstruct the ancient lights of an adjoining house. * * * In modern times the period of prescription or limitation has been shortened, and the uninterrupted and exclusive enjoyment\" of window-lights for twenty years has been held to be sufficient to raise a presumption of title to the unobstructed enjoyment of that protection. In Daniel v. North, 11 East’s R, 371, it was considered as settled law, that twenty years’ quiet and uninterrupted possession of a window-light was sufficient ground for a jury to presume a grant or covenant, provided that there was evidence that the owner of the opposite premises had knowledge, during the twenty years, of the fact.” And Greenleaf says, in sec. 543, of his 2d vol. on Evidence: “Erom this view of the present state of the law on this subject, it appears that the plea of prescription will be maintained by any competent evidence of an uninterrupted, exclusive enjoyment of the. subject prescribed for during twenty years, with a* claim of title, and with the actual or presumed knowledge of those adversely interested.” If it is lawful for appellant to stop appellee’s windows with his fence, it is also lawful for him to use his premises for any business that is lawful in itself, though the exercise of it may render the adjoining tenements unfit for habitation. Such a rule will annul all the law on the subject of nuisance, and leave the well-disposed part of every community to the whims and caprices of the selfish and. malicious, that may become owners of adjoining lots. The conclusion or hypothesis upon which the decision in the case of Parker v. Foote is based, is, that no person, without an actual invasion of the rights of another by the commission of an actual trespass thereon, can acquire a beneficial interest by prescription in his land, which, with due deference to the learning of the judge that decided that case, is believed to be wholly fallacious.',\n",

       "  'case_summary': 'Deborah C. Folk, App’lt, v. Darwin Stocking et al., Resp’ts. (Supreme Court, General Term, Fourth Department, Filed November, 1887.) 1. Will—Construction of. By the third clause of her will the testatrix gave, devised and bequeathed all of her real estate to her four daughters or to their children, if either of her daughters should die during the lifetime of the testatrix, leaving children (subject to a charge of fifty dollars a year in favor-of her son A.). She afterward executed a codicil “ which is to be taken as a part thereof as follows: “I give and devise to my son Darwin and to my daughter Delphine S.,equally,share and share and share alike, all of my real estate situate on the south side of Main street, in the city of Binghamton being my homestead property, subject to all incumbrances thereon.\" At the time of the execution of the codicil the property on the south side of Main street.was occupied as a homestead. Held, that it was the intent of the testatrix by the use of the language found in the codicil to give to her son Darwin ard daughter Delphine all of her estate situate on the south side of Main street. 2. Same—Intent of testator. By devising it subject to all the incumbrances thereon, she did not intend to restrict the gift to such portion of said real estate as was actually incumbered in a mortgage to her son, executed before said codicil, which mortgage declared the premises thereby conveyed were the homestead premises of the party of the first part. 3. Same—Codicil—When it revokes a will. The codicil was a distinct, independent subsequent testamentary instru ment evincing a clear intent to pass to the devisees named in the codicil, the whole of her real estate. The third clause of the will was, therefore, revoked by the codicil. Appeal from a judgment, entered upon a decision made ■ at special term in Broome county awarding judgment to the defendants upon the merits, with costs to Darwin Stocking against the plaintiff, and without costs to any other party. On the 24th of February, 1883, Mahettable Stocking died in the city of Binghamton, leaving her last will and testament and a codicil thereto. She was the owner of certain real estate, on which she had resided for a great number of years, on the south side of Main street, in the said city. On the 31st day of July, 1869, she made and published her last and testament, wherein she charged her real and personal estate with fifty dollars per year for the benefit of her son, Amos Patterson, to continue as long as he should live; and wherein she bequeathed to her daughter, Delphine S., all her household furniture and effects, and inserted in her will the following language, viz.: “Third. I give, devise and bequeath all the rest, residue and remainder of my property and estate to my four daughters; if any of them shall die during my life-time leaving children, such children shall take the portion which their parent, if living, would have taken.” . On the 16th day of September, 1872, the testatrix executed the following codicil, viz.: “Codicil to the foregoing will made this 16th day of September, A. D. 1872, and which is to betaken osa part thereof, as follows: I give and devise to my son Darwin and to my daughter Delphine S. equally, share and share and share alike, all of my real estate situate on the south side of Main street, in the city .of Binghamton, being my homestead property, subject to all incumbrances thereon.” The testatrix left no husband surviving her, and her next of kin who survived her were two sons, Dennison Stocking and Darwin Stocking, and her four daughters, Delphine, Diantha, Eloise and Deborah. On the 17th of August, 1868, the testatrix executed and delivered to the defendant Darwin Stocking a mortgage on a portion of her real estate to secure the payment of the sum of $5,616, with interest, payable one month after her decease. The description contained in that mortgage was as follows: “All that tract or parcel of land situate in the city of Binghamton aforesaid, and bounded and described as follows, that is to say: On the north by Main street, on the east by lands of Simon C. Hitchcock, on the south by lands of the party of the first part, and on the west by lands of Mrs. Brownell; the- premises hereby conveyed are the premises of the party of the first part and on which she now resides, and are six rods wide from west to east and sixteen rods deep from north to south.” Prior to 1867 the plaintiff was in possession and was the owner of a lot on the south side of Main street, consisting -of about two acres, which was occupied by her and her family as a homestead. That in the years 1867 and 1868 she conveyed portions of said lot to other parties, so that she had left and thereafter owned óf said lot, a piece of land which was about six rods in width at the front of said lot, and about five rods in width, at the rear thereof, and about thirty-eight rods in depth, and she continued to occupy the same as a homestead until the time of her death, in February, 1883. The lot was not fenced off, or divided into lots, \"‘‘otherwise than by a fence that was built parallel with .Main street, between seventeen and eighteen rods south of \"the south line of said street, through which there were bars or a gate connecting the front part of said lot with the rear part thereof; such fence had been built and maintained for many years prior to the year 1867.” Frank J.

       "  'case_summary': 'La Fayette Bolden et al. v. James D. Sherman. Filed at Ottawa March 26, 1884. 1. Color of title—defined. Color of title is that which in appearance is a title, but in reality is not. It must be so far prima facie good in appearance as to be consistent with the idea of good faith. It must purport to transfer, and apparently transfer, the title to the holder. 2. Same—extent, as to boundaries. A deed purporting to convey two lots of land in a subdivision, by their numbers, where the plat and stakes showed the precise location of the lots sold, was held color of title to the entire lots as shown by the plat and stakes, notwithstanding one of the lots, as shown by other testimony, extended six feet over and upon an adjoining tract, and the description in the deed showing distances did include the six feet on the adjoining land. The monuments always prevail over distances. 3. . Limitation—act of 1839 — as to the payment of taxes—proof in respect thereto. \"Where a party having color of title shows the payment of all taxes on the premises for seven successive years, by the production of his tax receipts, showing the date of each payment and the amount thereof, this makes out a prima facie defence under the Limitation law of 1839, which must prevail unless the plaintiff shows that the taxes for some one of the seven years were paid, before the defendant made his payment. The testimony of the plaintiff, that he, by himself or agent, paid the taxes upon the same land for each of the same years, but not giving the amount or date of any of his payments, will not rebut the defendant’s prima facie case, and defeat the operation of the statute. 4. In an action of ejectment for a strip of land, the defence being the payment of taxes for seven years under color of title, the defendant admitted that the plaintiff had paid the taxes for the same seven years, and undertook to overcome the force and effect of the admission by proving that he had also paid taxes for the same years, but failed to show whose payments for the several years were first made: Held, that the evidence was not sufficient to overcome the admission. Such admission was held to impliedly concede that the plaintiff’s payments were first made, otherwise there could be no taxes for him to pay. 5. Bound Abies—monuments, as prevailing over distances—meaning of descriptive words, how ascertained. Monuments showing the boundaries of a lot conveyed, must prevail over the distances given in the description. The surroundings under which the language of a deed is used may be considered, to give a proper construction to the words, and that part of a description which the parties must be supposed most fully to understand, will govern. And where a lot is sold as platted, the fences and surveyor’s marks upon the ground, as, stakes, are facts indicating its boundaries, and will prevail over an attempt to- describe the lot by distances. Appeal from the Superior Court of Cook county; the Hon. Elliott Anthony, Judge, presiding. This is an action of ejectment, brought by Sherman, appellee, against Bolden and Stevens, appellants, to recover a strip of land six feet wide in its front on State street, and running eastward 144 feet to an alley, the north line of said strip being 927 feet south of the north line of fractional quarter-section 22,—otherwise described as six feet in width, from front to rear, of the north side of lot 8, in block 10, in assessor’s division of the north-west fractional quarter of section 22, etc., and also as being the north six feet in width, along the north side of lot 1, in Gurley’s subdivision of said lot 8, and part of lot 7,—the property being in possession of Bolden, as tenant of Stevens, who claims as owner. Plaintiff proved title in himself to this strip, acquired by him by conveyance from Augustus Garrett, to him, by deed dated August 14, 1847, and recorded November 2, 1847, conveying a tract 110 feet wide, of which this strip was part, and on the north line. But plaintiff never was in the actual possession of this strip of six feet. Defendant proved that Augustus Garrett, at the time of this conveyance to Sherman, was the owner in fee of the land next adjoining the land conveyed to Sherman on the north, for a width of 267 feet, fronting that distance on State street, and extending east to Wabash avenue. The land next north of this he had conveyed to Mrs. Seaman, at an earlier day. Augustus Garrett died about February, 1849, but before his death, inclosed his land with a fence. But the fence on the south side, instead of being placed on the true line between the land of Sherman and that of Garrett, was placed six feet south of that line, and upon the land of Sherman, so as to include this strip within his inclosure. Whether the north line of this inclosure was more than 267 feet north of the fence on the south, does not appear. After the death of Augustus Garrett, the title to this 267 feet of land on State street, next north of Sherman’s land, passed, by a decree of court, to his widow, Eliza Garrett. Eliza Garrett died in 1855, or early in 1856, and by her will her executors were clothed with power to sell and convey real estate of the testatrix. In March, 1856, the executors of Eliza Garrett, for the purposes of sale, made a plat, intended to cover this Garrett tract of 267 feet lying next north of Sherman’s land. By that time many parts of the fence of the inclosure made by Augustus Garrett were broken down and gone, but the fence on the south side, though considerably dilapidated, was still there, and the land from this fence to the north was em braced in the plat, and divided into eleven lots, fronting on\\' State street, each extending east to an alley. Lots 1 to 10, inclusive, numbering south from the north of the plat, were laid off 24 feet wide, and lot 11, the most southerly lot, was laid off 27 feet wide, its south line being the fence spoken off There were no monuments marked upon the plat by which the exact location of the ground, as to its north and south lines, could be ascertained; but witnesses who attended the sale say the marks of\\' the surveyor were still there, and the ground was platted as far* south as the fence, the fence being on the south line. The lots were sold in March, 1856, at a public sale, and Charles Ferren bought lots 10 and 11, at $5100, and received a contract from the executors, by which they contracted to sell the same to him. The description in the contract was: “Commencing at a point on State street 216 feet south of the north-west corner of the land belonging to the estate of said Eliza Garrett, deceased,—which adjoins the land formerly belonging to Mrs. Ann Seaman, of New York,—running south 51 feet, thence east 170 feet, thence north 51 feet, thence west 170 feet to the place of beginning, known in a certain plat or subdivision of said property, now in possession of said parties of the first part, as lots 10 and 11, in block 1.” This plat or subdivision was recorded November 14, 1856. This contract was, on November 27, 1856, assigned by Ferren to Stevens, one of appellants, and was filed for record November 28, 1856, and on May 2, 1859, Stevens paid in full the purchase money. Stevens, in 1859, sold to Kate Howard lot 10, and one foot off the north side of lot 11, and she, in 1859, built a brick house upon the property, 25 feet front, on State street. This left 26 feet between the south line of her house and the line of the fence on the south line of the six feet in controversy. On April 5, 1860, the executors who had made this sale, executed a deed to Stevens, by which they conveyed, or professed to convey, the same property to him, and by the very same description used in the contract of Ferren. In October, 1861, Stevens took possession of the 26 feet next south of the Howard property, and built a house upon it, and by himself and his tenants has been in the actual possession of the same ever since. This action was brought October 26, 1880. On the trial, defendants proved, by the production of tax receipts, the payment of taxes on the south 26 feet of lot 11, Garrett’s subdivision, etc., for the year 1861, on May 5, 1862; for the year 1862, on. May 7, 1863; for the year 1863, on May 19, 1864; for the year 1864, on December 14, 1864; for the year 1865, on May 1, 1866; for the year 1866, on May 6, 1867; for the year 1867, on June 4, 1868; for the year 1868, on June 12, 1869; and also tax receipts from 1868 to 1879, except for the years 1869 and 1870. On the trial, plaintiff, Sherman, testified as follows: Q. “Have you paid the taxes on these premises that were conveyed to you by Mr. Garrett? A. “Yes, sir. I paid them generally by my agent. Jonas M. Small paid the taxes for me for the last eighteen or twenty years. He is dead. I have not possession of all the tax receipts. During the years between 1858 up to 1868,1 sometimes paid the taxes, and sometimes Mr. Small paid them. My property was never sold for taxes upon my description, which was a part of the Gurley subdivision. ” Plaintiff produced tax receipts showing payment of the taxes for 1872, paid April 1, 1873; taxes for 1875, paid September 28, 1876; taxes for 1876, paid September 5, 1877. This is the substance of all the evidence bearing upon the questions discussed in the opinion, save what is therein stated. Mr. Chas. H. Wood, for the appellants: Under the facts in this case, defendant Stevens purchased by the plat, and the south line of the plat of Garrett’s subdivision was the south line of his land. McCormick v. Huse, 78 Ill. 363; Everett v. Boardman, 58 id. 429; Ambrose v. Raley, id. 506; Canal Trustees v. Havens, 11 id. 554. A constructive adverse possession will extend over the whole of the tract included in the color of title, though part be occupied. Hinchman v. Whetstone, 25 Ill. 185; Jackson v. Camp, 1 Cow. 605; Munro v. Merchant, 28 N. Y. 9; Turney v. Chamberlain, 15 Ill. 271. This case is analogous to, and should be governed by, the following eases: Hubbard v. Stearns, 86 Ill. 35; Bauer v. Gottmanhausen, 65 id. 499; Weber v. Anderson, 73 id. 439; Schneider v. Botsch, 90 id. 577. Where owners of adjoining lands build a fence between them upon the assumed boundary line, and each holds and occupies up to it, on his own side, claiming it as the true line, their possession is adverse, and will ripen into a valid title. Burrell v. Burrell, 11 Mass. 297; Stuyvesant v. Tompkins, 9 Johns. 62; Jones v. Smith, 64 N. Y. 180. The only exclusive effect of what is called “color of title, ” in connection with adverse possession, is to define the extent of the possession claimed. Sedgwick & Waite on Trial of Title to Land, sec. 761. Color of title is defined to be that which in appearance is title, but which in reality is no title. Wright v. Matteson, 18 How. 56; and see, generally, what is color of title,—Baker v. Swan, 32 Md. 355; Coleman v. Billings, 89 Ill. 190; Kruse v. Wilson, 79 id. 240; Woodward v. Blanchard, 16 id. 430; Chandler v. Spear, 22 Vt. 405; Gittens v. Lowry, 15 Ga. 338; Sedgwick & Waite on Trial of Title to Land, sec. 762. The contract and deed to Stevens both refer, on their face, to the plat of the Garrett subdivision. Where a plat .or map is referred to in a deed, it becomes, for the purpose of identifying the land, as much a part of the deed itself as if incorporated into it. Seaward v. Nalotte, 15 Cal. 306; Vance v. Fore, 24 id. 436; Davis v. Rainsford, 17 Mass. 207; Lincoln v. Wilder, 29 Maine, 179. Messrs. Rosenthal & Pence, for the appellee: Neither the twenty years’ Statute of Limitations, nor the statute of 1835 or 1839, has been pleaded, hence no defence can be made under those statutes. Borders v. Murphy, 78 Ill. 81. The nature of that adverse possession which is required to constitute a bar to the assertion of a legal title by the owner of it, or by one against whom the adverse occupant brings ejectment, must be actual, visible, notorious, distinct and hostile possession. Tyler on Ejectment, 900; 2 Smith’s Leading Cases, *561, 566; Calhoun v. Cook, 9 Pa. 226; Turney v. Chamberlain, 15 Ill. 271. In this case when here before, (101 Ill. 487,) this court said: “Adverse possession sufficient to defeat the legal title must be hostile in its character, and continue uninterruptedly for twenty years. (Turney v. Chamberlain, 15 Ill. 271; Ambrose v. Raley, 58 id. 506.) It is not claimed for defendants that either of them was in possession of this six feet for more than nineteen years.”',\n",

A testator devised to two different persons separately two lots with the houses thereon, giving to the devisees the joint right and privilege to an alley or gateway between them. The alley was wholly upon one of the properties, but ran along the line of the other. Subsequently the properties having changed ownership, the owner of the servient property entered into an agreement with the other owner under which he built over it and erected in front of it a large gate of the full width of the alley sufficient when open to permit tbe alley to be used as a driveway, and in tbe gate inserted a small door for pedestrians. Tbe agreement stipulated that the alley “should be used and remain as heretofore.” Both before and after the agreement the alley had been used as a driveway by both owners. Twenty-five years thereafter the owner of the servient property built a curb along the sidewalk in front of the property, practically preventing access to the alley as a driveway. Held, that the owner of the other property had the right to an injunction for the removal of the curb and to prevent any interference with his use of the entire width of the alley. 2. Where the use of an alley between two dwelling houses is not defined, limited or restricted by any covenant, the owner of one of the properties may use the alley for the passage of horses and vehicles, as well as for foot passengers provided he does not interfere with its use by the owner of the adjoining property.

A person, who has acquired by a grant an easement appurtenant to land, has the same right of property therein as he has in the land, and it is not necessary that he should use it to maintain his title; hence, his title is not affected by non-user: Weaver v.

A testator by his will devised and bequeathed all his real and personal estate, after payment of debts, expenses, &c., to his wife, “ provided however if she remains my widow and unmarried for and during her natural life; provided further if she should marry again after my decease, then my will is that she be paid and receive out of my estate the sum of six hundred dollars and no more.” He also provided that on her decease or marriage his executors should erect a suitable marble monument at his grave, and build a suitable fence around the cemetery lot where he should be buried, and appropriated a sum of money for that purpose; and, after the above provisions should be complied with, he devised and bequeathed so much of his estate as should remain at the decease of his wife to the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. Held, that the widow was entitled to the use, improvement and income of the whole estate, after payment of debts, expenses, &c., during her life or until she should marry again; and upon her being married again she would be entitled to the legacy of six hundred dollars; and, upon her death, after deducting the expenditures for the monument and fence around the cemetery lot, the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions would be entitled to the residue.

Fourth, my will is, in case it becomes necessary, that my executors hereinafter named sell and convey the whole or any part of my real or personal property as in their judgment will be for the best interest of my estate. Fifth, my will is, on the decease of my beloved wife, or on the event of her marriage, that my executors or the survivor of them erect a suitable marble monument at my grave, with appropriate inscriptions thereon. And I direct that a suitable fence be built around the cemetery lot wherein my said executors hereinafter named shall bury me, which shall be used as a burying place for myself and my beloved wife; and I hereby appropriate the sum of one thousand five hundred dollars for cemetery purposes and the erection of the monument aforesaid, and for fencing and ornamenting and decorating the place of my burial; providing, however, there be that amount remaining at the decease or marriage of my beloved wife, after the appropriation and provisions hereinbefore mentioned have been complied with. Sixth, my will is, after the provisions hereinbefore mentioned have been complied with, that so much of my estate, whether real, personal or mixed, as shall remain at the decease of my beloved wife, I give, devise and bequeath to the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, for the promotion of the missionary cause, to be paid by my executors or the survivor of them as soon after her decease as shall by them be found convenient.

       "  'case_summary': 'B. B. SUGG and MINNIE O. SUGG v. TOWN OF GREENVILLE. (Filed 13 October, 1915.) 1. Deeds and Conveyances — Boundaries—Trials—Questions of law — Questions for Jury. What is the boundary of a tract of land is a question of law in construing a conveyance thereof; but the location of the boundary is a question of fact. 2. Deeds and Conveyances — Municipal Corporations — Streets—Dedication— Acceptance. The acceptance of land offered by the private owner thereof for street purposes is in the discretion of the proper municipal authorities, and it is necessary to be had before such dedication can become effectual and binding, though it may be either express or implied. 3. Same — Discretionary Powers — Width of Streets. The proper municipal authorities in extending a street of a city or town are vested with the discretionary power to determine the width of the street as thus extended, and there is no requirement that the width of the street as extended shall be the same width or conform to the lateral lines of the original street, or those of its further extension. 4. Deeds and Conveyances — Descriptions—Boundaries—Ambiguity—Trials— Questions for Jury. Where a conveyance of lands calls for the eastern line of a certain street of a town, extended through its intersection with P Street, and there is conflicting evidence as to whether the physical or actual boundary had been established and was used at the time and was a more western line than that of the theoretical extension, had it been made on a straight line through P Street, the locus in quo lying below the street, it raises a question for the jury to decide as to which of the two lines the parties intended when the conveyance was made, when the language of the conveyance leaves the matter in doubt. \\' 5. Deeds and Conveyances — Interpretation—Meaningless Words. Where a street is called for as a boundary to a tract of land conveyed, and the location of the eastern line of the street is left in doubt, and it further appears that another call in the description is for the street “extended” or thence with the street extended through its intersection with P Street, the theoretical extension of the street through P Street in a straight line on that side thereof will not necessarily control, there being evidence tending to establish a different line actually adopted and used by the municipality, and under the facts in this case it is held that the words “through its intersection with P Street” should be read as if written “to” the said intersection, as that was clearly meant. 6. Deeds and Conveyances — Interpretation—Former Deeds — References—Intent — Evidence. Where the description in a conveyance of lands calls for one of its boundaries as a certain street, the line of which is left uncertain, and reference is made therein to a prior conveyance in the chain of title, the courts in construing the deed will consider it in its entirety, and givé reasonable effect to all its parts, the circumstances surrounding the parties at the time, and other relevant matters and where the reference to the former deed sheds light upon the intention of the parties, it will be considered in interpreting the deed in question in order to ascertain this intent., 7. Municipal Corporations — Filing Claims — Unliquidated Damages — Torts— Interpretation of Statutes. Revisal, section 1384, requiring claimants against a city or town to file tlieir claims with the proper municipal authorities, has no application to actions ex contractu, where the damages are unliquidated, nor to torts. 8. Deeds and Conveyances — Actions—Grantor and Grantee — Parties. Where a grantor and his grantee bring an action against a municipality to recover damages for the unlawful appropriation of land for street purposes, if the former has retained title to the locus in quo in himself, he would have the right of independent or separate action to recover it, and if otherwise, the latter may maintain an independent or separate action for it, and in either event the one would not be a necessary party to the other’s action. 9. Same — Mutual Mistake — -Pleadings—Amendments. The grantor is a necessary party to the grantee’s action against another to recover lands when the latter claims that the locus in quo was intended to be included in the conveyance to him and was omitted by mutual mistake, and asks for a correction and for a recovery of the land in that aspect; and in this case it is held that the grantee may apply for leave of the court to amend his complaint, so as to make the proper allegations of mistake so that the deed may be reformed. Appeal by plaintiffs from Connor, J., at tbe April Term, 1915, of Pitt. Special proceeding, begun before tbe clerk for tbe assessment of damages for taking land to be used as a street of tbe town, wbicb was appealed by defendant to tbe Superior Court. Tbe deed from Minnie 0. Sugg to ber eoplaintiff, B. B. Sugg, describes tbe western line of tbe land conveyed to tbe latter as “tbence with Elizabeth (Street) extended, through its intersection with Fifth Street,” and tbe question is, where is this line? Tbe defendant contended that it meant tbe eastern line of Elizabeth Street, if extended tbe width of. that street north of Fifth Street, wbicb is 49 feet, or a theoretical extension of that street, whether actually laid out south of Fifth Street or not, and tbe court below seems to have taken that view. This would fix tbe eastern line of Elizabeth Street and the western line of plaintiff’s lot below Fifth Street, at C, D, as shown on tbe official map, and if this be tbe line, tbe ruling was correct, and tbe plaintiff cannot recover. Tbe defendant also contends, and there was some evidence to show that the street bad been actually opened to that line. Tbe plaintiff, however, contends and offered much testimony to show that Elizabeth Street bad been actually laid out by tbe defendant below Fifth Street, as represented by tbe letters A, B, E, F, on tbe map, and was used by tbe public, and fully recognized by tbe defendant as tbe only extension of Elizabeth Street south of Fifth Street, and that, as thus laid out, tbe western line of plaintiff’s land would be at A, B, as shown on tbe map, or tbe eastern line of tbe Wiley Yines land, and that tbe call of the deed above mentioned should be extended to that line, as it is the line intended by the parties to the deed as the western line of the land conveyed. Tbe jury returned the following verdict: 1. \"Was the plaintiff the owner of that portion of Elizabeth Street lying on the western line of his lot described in the complaint, 25 feet wide and 160 feet long, as alleged? Answer: “No.” 2. If so, what damages is plaintiff entitled to recover of defendant on account of the taking of the said lot for a part of Elizabeth Street? Answer: “$500.” Tbe court instructed tbe jury to answer tbe first issue “No,” and tbat tbey would not answer tbe second issue. As tbis was tbe direction of a verdict, we need only set out some of tbe testimony favorable to tbe plaintiff’s contention. Tbe deed of Minnie Sugg to B. B. Sugg, dated 1 September, 1910, after describing tbe land conveyed, adds these words to tbe description, “being tbe westwardly portion of tbe lot conveyed by T. J. Jarvis, commissioner, to Minnie 0. Exum (now Minnie 0. Sugg). Tbe Jarvis deed, dated September, 1894, conveys tbe land west of tbe A. C. L. E. E. (formerly Wilmington and Weldon Eail-road), and “on tbe south side of Fifth Street and adjoining tbe lot of Eeuben Adams, tbe lots of Margaret Miller and others.” Tbe deed of J. W. Yines to tbe town of Greenville, dated 13 January, 1904, conveys land of tbe following description: “Beginning at an iron stake on tbe south side of Fifth Street on tbe river road, tbe point at which tbe western line of Elizabeth Street as originally laid would intersect tbe line of said Yines, and runs tbe course of said Elizabeth Street south 14 degrees and 30 minutes west about one hundred and forty feet to Del-pbia Wooten’s line, then with her line and tbe Henry Sheppard line (now owned by said town) an easterly direction to J. L. Sugg’s southwestern corner, then with said Sugg’s western line a northerly direction about one hundred and sixty-one feet to bis northwest corner in said street or road, and then with said street or road to tbe beginning. Said piece or parcel of land hereby conveyed is for\\' tbe continuation of Elizabeth Street.” Tbis deed recognizes tbe line as claimed by plaintiffs. B. B. Sugg, one of tbe plaintiffs, testified: “I am tbe Sugg mentioned in tbe deed from Minnie 0. Sugg to B. B. Sugg, and I was living in Greenville at tbe time. It was 1 September, 1910. Minnie 0. Sugg was tbe wife of J. L. Sugg, and J. L. Sugg was my uncle. Minnie 0. Sugg prior to her marriage was Minnie 0. Exum, referred to in one of tbe deeds introduced in evidence. At tbe time tbe deed was executed I was living on tbe property, a part of which I purchased at tbe time. When I purchased tbe lot from Minnie O. Sugg I knew where tbe Wiley Yines lot was; it was just west of tbe Sugg property, as indicated on the map. I saw tbe property indicated between \\'CD’ and \\'AB’ several times a day. At tbe date of my purchase of tbe property tbe land lying within tbe black line was opened as a part of Elizabeth Street, tbat is, tbe strip purchased by tbe town from Wiley Yines; it was purchased, opened, and used as tbe street connecting Elizabeth Street and Bonner’s Lane.. In driving from Fifth Street to Bonner’s Lane you will partly drive over tbe Wiley Yines strip and partly on tbis side, but mostly on tbe Wiley Yines property which tbe town purchased. Tbe strip indicated as lying between \\'AB’ and \\'CD’ was never opened or used by tbe public as a street, but my uncle did drive over it before be died to reach bis stables, wbicb were in tbe rear of tbe property from Eiftb Street. I never knew tbe town intended taking my property for a street until several months after I bad purchased it, and I did not know then that they intended taking it until they bad put thirty or forty bands to work out there digging it down. I protested at tbe time and was then asked permission by tbe town to be allowed to go ahead, but refused. The town jrarchased ’the property indicated on tbe map between lines £AB’ and £EE’ from Wiley Vines in 1904. My western line is indicated by letters £AB.’ My «line is tbe old line between Sugg’s and Wiley Vines’ land, and it is evidenced by iron stakes. Tbe Sugg line called for in tbe deed from Wiley Vines to the town of Greenville is my line indicated on tbe map by letters £AB.’ When I purchased tbe property, tbe strip tbe town bought from Wiley Vines was opened and used by tbe public. When tbe town bands were cutting down tbe property they went over on tbe Sheppard lot some and dug in tbe back of my line also. They have left an embankment in tbe rear of my property of six and one-half feet that it would be impossible to drive over. I gave in my property for taxation at tbe same as I have always\\' given it in since I purchased it, and although I considered it damaged considerably by tbe town’s action, I knew that I bad no authority to reduce its assessed taxable valuation. I paid $1,150 for tbe property in 1910 and I purchased it from my aunt by marriage, with whom I was living at tbe time. It fronts on Fifth Street, and all\" property in that section of tbe town has certainly quadrupled in value within tbe last four years. Since tbe town has opened tbe street through tbe property purchased from Wiley Vines you can drive from Eiftb Street through by Bonner’s Lane to tbe Atlantic Coast Line depot, but it is very difficult driving. There has been passing from Eiftb Street to Bonner’s Lane over this property ever since the town purchased from Vines and opened tbe street, but my property has never been in general use by tbe public, and such passing was only by permission, and any use of it was only permissive. Several years ago there was a fence clear across that property-and tbe Wiley Vine.s property, running from east to west, and when people passed through it bad to be taken down and was often left down, wbicb fact I remember annoyed my uncle very much. Tbe remnants of tbe fence are there now. Shortly after this fence was moved Mr. Shepjiard sold bis lot just back of mine to the town for tbe purpose of opening a street. That deed calls for my line. Tbe fence was tom down before I bought tbe property and there was some permissive passing that I knew of when I took tbe deed, but tbe town never undertook to take my property for public use as a street until about two and a half years ago. They bad prior to this time purchased tbe Vines and tbe Sheppard lots wbicb connect Fifth Street and Bonner’s Lane, and this was the property -that the passing was supposed to be through. I do not know, of my own knowledge, what took place prior to 1909, for I only came here, during that year. When I bought my property my aunt reserved a driveway back of my lot so that her wood pile in the rear of her property could be reached from Fifth Street or from Elizabeth Street extended. \\' However, this driveway has never been used, and although the deed reserved the right of use, the property was still to be mine. If the town had not taken twenty-six feet of my property I would have enough frontage on Fifth Street for two lots, but as it is, I will not have enough frontage left there to make two lots large enough.” Wiley Yines, witness for the plaintiffs, testified: “I own property on Fifth Street; it is located on the Tarboro road or on the south of Fifth Street west of Elizabeth Street extended. I bought the property from Mr. Oscar Hooker. I sold a strip of land to the town of Greenville, but before I sold this property I was joined on the east by the Sugg property; an old fence stood on the line between us and an old spring was in there somewhere near the line on my side. I knew where the line between us originally ran, and I put iron stakes on the line or as near to it as I could come. I showed Mr. Dresbach the stake that I set when he was up there making the survey. My deed calls for the Sugg property, and until I sold it to the town my property joined the Sugg property on the east. The deed I gave the town of Greenville calls for the Sugg line. The property I sold the town is shown on the map as enclosed in black lines. It was several years after I sold to the town before I noticed any cutting or grading on the property. I do not remember just how long. There was no street opening from Fifth Street to Bonner’s Lane, but people went across there as a near cut. The spring I referred to was two or three or four feet from the line, out in the street as it now stands. The driving was on the east side of the spring; I do not know whether the driving was on Mr. Sugg’s side or mine. Before the town bought my property and opened the street it was grown up in reeds and briars. There used to be an old ditch that is now filled up; it was located on my side of the line.’.’ Lance \"Wooten, witness for the plaintiffs, testified: “I- live on Elizabeth Street, as it is now opened. I live up there at Delphia Wooten’s. I built there in 1901 myself and I know the locality. I remember when I moved up there, 1901, there was a .fence across Mr. Sugg’s property. I don’t know how long it remained there, but I remember sometimes when I would go in it would be down, and when I would come out it would be up. There used to be a wall on the line between Wiley Yines’ property and Mr. Sugg’s property, but after Wiley sold to the town I think he moved it. I have seen two iron stakes up there; they were right behind the wall’, and when the wall was moved the stakes were left there. I have not seen the stakes lately and no one has told me anything about them. I think the property was cut down by the town in 1911; it was cut right back to my house, about as deep as my house.” Jack Pitt, witness for the plaintiffs, testified: “I have been living here about 60 years; been working there about 15 years. I used to work for Mr. Sugg and I know where the fence was between Mr. Sugg and Wiley Vines. It was right straight across from where there was a cedar behind Wiley Vines’ house. There was a stump there and a wife fence. I don’t know who kept up the fence, but I put it up several times for Mr. Sugg when people would leave it down. After the town bought from Wiley Vines, people drove through his side regularly. I remember where the line was; there were old posts there. He sold to the town up to the line and it made a good wide little street. The people drove over there and used it as a street after the town bought it from Wiley. I remember when they got the property graded out, but I don’t know how long it has been. It was since Mr. B. B. Sugg bought.” W. C. Dresbaeh, witness for the plaintiffs, testified: “The heavy black lines drawn on the map in an ell-shape just across Fifth Street from the Sugg property is the concrete wall to Mr. C. S. Carr’s front yard, and it is impossible to extend Elizabeth Street to Bonner’s Lane without taking in this property.” Q. Has it been extended the full width? \\'Defendant objects; sustained; plaintiffs except. There was testimony given by the defendant’s witnesses which tended to contradict that of the plaintiffs, but it need not be set out. Judgment was entered upon the verdict for the defendant and an appeal taken by the plaintiffs, after reserving their exceptions. D. M. Glorie and Harding & Pierce for plaintiffs. F. (?.

       "  'case_summary': 'Kiowa Realty Company, Plaintiff, v. Martin M. Molenaor et al., Defendants. (Supreme Court, New York Special Term, February, 1917.) Title — when claim to, is untenable — rules — Code Civ. Pro. § 1638 — Heal Property Law, § 260. The rule that it is an essential quality of an estate tail that the creator thereof shall have had in contemplation the unlimited descent of the estate to the chain of heirs of the grantee requires the use of the words “ heirs of the body ” of the grantee, except in wills where a more lax interpretation leading to an implication of those words is permissible. By a will probated in 1812, testator devised to his eldest son, “ the legitimate heirs of his body or to the nearest heirs of his body,” five city lots, four of which are and always have been unoccupied and unfenced and one upon which there is and has been for some years a shack or hut in which some of the defendants reside. Coupled with a devise to each of two other sons, “ the legitimate heirs of his body or to his nearest lawful heirs,” was a legacy, and the will declared it to be testator’s will and desire that said younger sons should be liberally educated ouf of the income of his estate exclusive of the legacies to them. ■ Tc his daughter testator devised certain lots “ under the same restriction and provisos with my three sons already named, that is, all her legacy shall descend to the heirs of her body, etc.” In an action brought under section 1638 of the Code of Civil Procedure to. compel the determination of a claim adverse to plaintiff in respect to the five lots, it was stipulated that it held a full legal paper title thereto passing through the eldest son of testator and its claim was that under his will said son became seized of a fee simple in property which includes the lots in controversy. Defendants’ claim was that the eldest son of testator took, if anything, only a life interest and that the remainder or fee vested in his lawful heir through whom the defendant claims title. Held, that the testator devised to his eldest son an estate tail which the statute of February 23, 1786, converted into a fee simple and the title of plaintiff to the lots in question is good, and that it is entitled to maintain the action; as its constructive possession of the property, evidenced by its clear paper title thereto, is sufficient under the statute. A contention-that the deed under which plaintiff claims title . is void under section 260 of the Real Property Law which provides that a grant of real property is void if at the time the said “ property is in the actual possession of a person claiming under a title adverse to that of the grantor,” based upon defendants’ occupation of a shack on one of the lots coupled with the filing of the maps in the office of the register of the county in which they lay claim to the title of all the lots, is untenable. Action under section 1638 of the Code of Civil Procedure to compel the determination of a claim adverse to that of plaintiff in respect to certain real estate.

       "  'case_summary': \"Driggers vs United States. Opinion delivered Sept. 26, 1907. (104 S.W. Rep. 1166.) 1. Criminal Law — Evidence—Hearsay. As hearsay the testimony of a witness in a murder trial in regard to conduct and threats seen and heard by him, was not objectionable. 2. Criminal Law — Conspiracy. Evidence in a murder trial was held to show that there was a conspiracy which resulted in death of decedent at the time threats were made against him and therefore admissible against any one who afterward entered into such conspiracy. 3. Same — Instructions. Where the instructions requested were covered by the general charge, it was not error when the requested instructions were refused. 4. Homicide — Justifiable. By Mansf. Dig. § 1547 (Ind. Ter. Ann St. 1899, § 890) justifiable homicide is the killing of a person in self defense or in defense of property. By Section 1665, Mansf. Dig. (Ind. Ter. Ann St. 1899 § 1008) it is felony for a person to willfully or maliciously destroy any fence or inclosure. Held,-. That decedent did not commit a felony justifying homicide, when he placed his hand on a post, not to destroy the fence but to make a gap through which his cattle could be driven into the field, especially when he had a .right known to defendant. 5. Criminal Law — Appeal. Where there was objection made or exception saved to a charge of self-defense, in a trial for murder, the charge cannot be reviewed on appeal. 6. Criminal Law — Accomplices. It is for the jury to determine whether a witness is an accomplice requiring corroboration to support a conviction. • Therefore it was sufficient to instruct that under Mansf. Dig. § 225-9 (Ind. Ter. Ann. St. 1899 § 1602). conviction could not be had on the testimony of an accomplice, unless it was corroborated, and there was’no error in ceasing to charge witness with being an accomplice. 7. Same — Instructions. If the word “accomplice” is regarded by defendant as a technical term to be defined by the court, he should make such request, but should not ask that an instruction be given that a certain -witness is an accomplice; that is a question for the jury to determine. 8. Homicide — Murder. There are other malicious elements besides ill will which would constitute a killing a murder, for any unlawful cause or motive is a sufficient element. 9. Same — Instructions—Combat. If defendant believed a field belonging to him to have been taken possession of by decedent, where decedent with others would be, armed with deadly weapons, and therefore organized and armed a company of men and himself, .and went to place of killing to meet decedent, and conflict énsued in which decedent was killed, then the charge that such conflict was mutual combat and all the parties thereto could not claim defense as they were guilty of murder, was correct. 10. Same — Appeal. Defendant contended that decedent committed a felony, justifying killing, when he attempted to tear down his fence. Evidence was introduced to the effect that on the evening of the dajr of the killing witness said decedent had his hand on the post and witness testified for prosecution that decedent did not have his hand on the post. Prosecution then introduced evidence to the effect that on the day after the killing witness related the story as told by him at the trial. It was held that though such corroborative evidence was erroneously admitted, its admission was not prejudicial error, since the tearing down of the fence did not constitute a felony justifying a killing and evidence tended to show murder, and the evidence of the prosecution, including that admitted erroneously, tended to show that decedent was not killed because of'a motive which would constitute murder and therefore was in favor of defendant. Error to the United States Court for the Southern District of the Indian Territory; before Justice J. T. .Dickerson, June 21, 1905. ' B. i<\\\\ Driggers was convicted of murder, and he brings error. Affirmed. The plaintiff in error, B. E. Driggers, with five others, to wit, L. W. Goff, Tom McCarter, Tom Morgan, Ted Bennett, and John Underwood, was on the 13th day of October, 1903, indicted at Ada, in the Southern district, upon a charge of murder. There are four counts in the indictment. The first count alleges that plaintiff in error, Driggers, with a certain-Winchester rifle, loaded, etc., did, under such circumstances as to constitute the crime of murder, slay and kill one.Robert G. Brad}', and that the-others, his co-defendants, were present, aiding, abetting, and assisting him in the unlawful and malicious murder. The -second, third, and fourth counts are identical with the first, except the second charges McCarter as principal in the first degree, and all of the others as principals in the second degree. The third count, charges Ted Bennett as principal in the first degree, with the others as principals in the second degree, and the fourth count is the same, excejjt John Underwood is chai'ged as principal in the first degree. After the trial and conviction of Goff, at Ada, the venue was changed and the cause transferred to Pauls Valley, where a nolle prosequi was entered as to the others, and Driggers was placed upon trial, resulting in a verdict of guilty without capital punishment. A motion for new trial was filed and overruled, and the case regularly brought here by writ of error. The facts upon which the indictment was predicated were as follows: One J. 0. McNeal was the lessee of a certain farm, which, for the year 1902, he had rented to two men by the name of Goff and Riley, who raised that year a crop of corn on one part of the place and a crop of cotton, on another part, the two crops joining each other, with no fence between them. After gathering the crop of corn in the fall of the year, Cíoff and Riley sold the field of stalks, which were left standing, to the defendant Driggers; but, because of the fact that, Goff and Riley had 'not finished gathering their crop of cotton, the defendant Driggevs could not turn his cattle in the field without damage to the cotton, until after the 1st of January, 1903, which was, of course,, after the termination of the Goff and Riley lease. In the meantime McNeal, the original lessee, leased the premises to Brady, the deceased, for the year 1903, which gave to him the right of possession on January 1, 1903. It was claimed, however, by the defendant at the trial that Goff had also rented the place from McNeal for that year. This was denied by McNeal, but there was some proof offered tending to establish such An agreement. On January 2, 1903, the deceased entered upon the land and built a cross-fence, dividing the field of stalks from the field of cotton, with the intention of driving his cattle in the field of stalks the next day. This fact became known to Goff and the defendant on the afternoon of January 2d. On the evening and night of that day they went to various places in the neighborhood, procuring Winchester rifles and guns and ammunition for the purpose of using them to prevent deceased from entering with his cattle the next day. In the meantime the deceased had learned that these men were preparing to resist any attempt he might make to enter the premises, and armed himself with a pistol, and the next morning, January 3d, he, with four other men, drove a herd of cattle belonging to the deceased to the disputed premises, with the intention, it is claimed, of turning them into the field of cornstalks. When they arrived at the place, they found the defendant and Goff, and two full-blood Indians, McCarter and Underwood, and two others, all armed with Winchester rifles and shotguns, standing inside the field. The cattle were being driven through a lane which separated the premises in dispute from those of a Mr. Hogan Keel. About opposite the cross-fence which deceased had put up on the day before, and on the other side of the lane leading into Mr. Keel's premises, there was a gate. When the cattle arrived at the gate, it being open or down, a few of them ran through into Mr. Keel's premises. The deceased went in and drove them out into the lane, and dismounted from his horse. From the government's proof, he dismounted for the purpose of readjusting his saddle blanket, which had slipped back, and made no effort to get his pistol. The testimony of the defendant on this point was to the effect that the deceased jumped from his horse, and with one hand seized a post as if to pull down the fence, so that the cattle could enter, and with the other had seized his pistol and was in the act of drawing it when the defendant Driggers fired at him with a shotgun loaded with BB shot, and killed him. Whichever contention be true, it is certain that Brady fell with his pistol in his pocket. It had not been drawn. Defendant then fired at Kelley, wounding. him and killing his horse. Some eight or ten shots were-fired, all by the defendant's party. C. C. Potter, H. M'. Carr, Crawford & McKoion, Cruce, Óruce & Blakemore, and Moman Pruiett, for plaintiff in error. Messrs. George R.

A lotowner is not justified in erecting a barrier of close boards on his lot in front of the windows of his neighbor’s adjoining' house, in such manner as to obstruct the influx of light and air to those windows, for the purpose of preventing the throwing of refuse from those windows onto his lot, where a barrier which would not so obstruct the light and air would be equally effective for the desired purpose. 2. The fact that a lotowner permitted persons of bad character, whose behavior was a nuisance, to occupy a part of the house on a lot, does not justify the erection of a barrier by the adjoining lotowner, the effect of which is to obstruct the influx of light and air: to the house, where the objectionable tenants were ejected as soon as notice of their conduct was given to the landlord. 3. Defendant owned three adjoining lots, and erected a house on the middle one, fronting on the street and covering the whole width of the lot. On the east side of the house was an inset, in which windows were built. There were no other windows on that side of the house. The house on the east lot was built forty-five feet back from the street; the intervening space being a lawn, and a paved alleyway between it and the line of the middle lot.—Seld, that, in a grant of the middle lot,-the existence of the inset in the house thereon would not rebut the implication of a grant of the right of light and air over the lawn. 4. The construction by defendant of a house so that a part of it could be lighted only by certain windows opening on a vacant lawn in front of defendant’s adjoining property, created an easement in the light and air from defendant’s lawn, which passed with the conveyance of the house. 5. The fact that the conveyance expressly granted the right to use the alley on the west lot, does not exclude the implication of a grant of the right to the light and air over the east lot. 6. The obstruction of the right to the influx of light and air by a private person will be restrained, notwithstanding compensation can be made in damages; such right being property of which the owner cannot be deprived by private persons for private use, even on just compensation made. On final bearing on bill, answer and proofs. Mr. Jacob W. Be Toe and Mr. Waller B. Hudson, for the complainant. Mr. Francis Scott, for the defendant.\",\n",

       "  'case_summary': 'VILLAGE OF RED JACKET v. PINTON. Adverse Possession —Street Line — Evidence—Constructive Notice. When defendant purchased his lot, in 1873, a fence ran a zigzag course in front of the lot, and éncroached on the street line. The street was a mere roadway, such as a small population and primitive surroundings required, and apparently it was not considered necessary that any proprietor should fence with regard to the line. In 1890 defendant moved a building onto the lot, and located it so that it encroached on the street. At various times he admitted the encroachment, and said he would move the building back when his neighbors should move theirs. In 1896 he built the wall of a new building flush with the old, but, on being informed of the true line, and ordered to tear down the wall, did so, and placed it on the true line. In 1898 the old building burned, and his attempt to rebuild on the same line was sought to be enjoined by the village. Held, that defendant’s possession was not of such character, and under such circumstances, as would warrant the conclusion that the village authorities had notice of a claim of adverse possession, and acquiesced therein.

       "  'case_summary': 'John A. Horbach, plaintiff in error, v. Lorin Miller, defendant in error. 1. Praotioe: exceptions: motion for a new trial. All alleged errors, occurring during the trial of a cause, must be excepted to, and complained of in the motion for a new trial, in order to obtain a review of the same in the supreme court; and error committed by the giving of an oral charge to the jury, instead of reducing such charge to writing, as required by Gen. Slat., 262, is no exception to the rule. 2. Boundaries: evidence: instructions to jury. The identity of a block of lots depended upon the correct location of another block, some distance off, a corner of which had been taken as an initial point in making the survey; and a surveyor testified that in 1857, a fence was erected around the block, of which he had personal knowledge; that the fence was destroyed in 1862 ; and in making the survey in question, he found the west line and southwest corner, by remains of fence posts, there being old bark and rotten wood about every seven feet ; held, that the correct location of the initial point was properly submitted to the jury, upon an instruction, that in order to determine whether the fence was built upon the true line of the block, they might take into account the time when it was built, the fact that it was about the time of the survey, when the corners were easily ascertained, and if they believed the testimony warranted it, they might presume that the fence was built on the line of said block. 3. Limitation of Actions: statutory construction. The change in the statutory period for bringing actions for the recovery of real estate, from twenty-one to ten years, made by amendment to Sec. 6 of the civil code, February 15, 1869, applies to actions brought since the taking effect of the amendment. The time existing between the passage and taking effect of the act, was allowed by the legislature for the purpose of bringing actions on claims then existing, before the same were barred by the new enactment. 4. --: ADVERSE POSSESSION. The title to land becomes complete in an adverse occupant, when he has maintained an actual, continued, and notorious possession, claiming the same as his own against all persons for the full extent of the statutory period; and the enclosing of such land within a fence, the maintenance of such fence, cultivation of the land, and payment of the taxes on the same, for said period, with said intention, is sufficient in law to constitute adverse possession. 5. Practice : objections to testimony. Where objection is made to the admission of testimony, the reason and grounds of objection should be stated. Error to the district court of Douglas County. Tiib action was commenced by Lorin Miller on tlie twelfth day of October, A. D. 1872, against John A. Horbach, to recover the possession of a tract of land, describing the same by metes and bounds, formerly known as block 172-gr in tbe city of Ornaba. Miller claimed title through Moffat, to whom Horbach and wife had deeded the premises on the sixteenth day of January, A. D., 1858. Horbach claimed title by virtue of an alleged actual, exclusive, adverse, and notorious possession, since April, A. D., 1860, and he further plead the statute of limitations. Hpon the trial of the cause before Chief Justice Lake, and a jury, deeds from Horbach to Moffat, from Moffat to Allen, and from Allen to Miller were introduced in evidence, all of said deeds describing the land in controversy as block 172-J- in the city of Omaha. Miller, on his own behalf, testified as follows: “I surveyed into lots and blocks this land in controversy, in 1855, for a company calling themselves the Omaha City Company; I surveyed about 1500 acres into streets, lots, blocks, and alleys. The streets running north and south were 80 feet wide, those running east and west were 66 feet wide. We commenced at the northeast corner of the tract and numbered successively back and forth. The blocks were numbered fractionally to distinguish them from those in the city proper. The size of the lots were 66 by 132 feet south of Napoleon street, and some of them 44 by 132 feet north of Napoleon street. Ten or twelve years ago E. V. Smith resided on block, 128-J-, and he has resided there ever since. I was with George Smith when he made the survey mentioned in his testimony. . When I surveyed the land I took extension Twenty-first street for abase line. Subsequent to this survey I have had a good deal to do with this land. In making the survey we started from the south west corner of block 128-J- and run south on Eighteenth street, assuming the streets to be 66 feet wide and the lots\\' 44 feet wide, and then run west to the center of Twenty-first street, and from thence 49 feet west to the corner of block 172-J-. Afterwards I got Smith to go with me and we re-measured the other way, starting at the same point as before and running west, and then south, assuming the same width of streets as before, and we came out at the same point within an inch. After I got my deed from Allen, in 1868, I and Horbaeh made an effort to find the corners. When, on the ground, Horbach told me where he thought the corners were. I had bought the property and wanted him to go with me so that I could take possession. I took Horbaeh and Kennedy with me. Smith had found the corner of block 128J without my being with him, and he showed it to me. I saw no indications of this being the corner, except wliat Smith showed me, an old post and a small tree which Smith had kept in memory. I saw the trees on the block where Shields used to live. I took Smith’s statement as to the starting point. If his base was wrong then this survey would be imperfect.” George Smith, on behalf of the plaintiff, Miller, testified substantially as follows: “Have been here seventeen years. I am a surveyor. Did not live much in Omaha in 1858. After that with the exception of one year I lived here. I was not acquainted with the city blocks in Omaha at that time. I don’t know from what maps deeds were made. There were two or three lithograph maps then in use. [Map of the Omaha City Company shown witness, and afterwards admitted in evidence under objection on the part of defendant.] I have made a survey and think I have ascertained where block 178-J was. I took the south half of block 128-a- as my data. I don’t know that this block was fenced in by Shields. I used to see it in 1857 and 1858. I had personal knowledge of the existence of a fence at that time. It was our primitive kind of a fence, posts about seven feet apart and pickets driven in the ground. In 1858, I lived in the house on the block. The fence measured 220 by 284 feet (east and west). Yan Smith occupied the enclosure in 1858. There was a tree in the north-east corner of the enclosure, only one tree. There was a frame building in the enclosure fronting on Seventeenth street east. The fence was destroyed in 1859 or 1860. In 1862 there was no fence. In digging up the ground, I thought I found the west line of the fence and the south west corner. I found some old bark and rotten wood about every seven feet. From this I ran a line south and west to what I thought might be block 172-J-. I dug into the earth about the south west corner and found a remnant of wood that might have been a point of a stake. It was about one inch long and one inch square. It was about eight inches below the surface of the ground. It was very rotten but seemed to have once been sharpened. I staked for Miller, block 172£. I assumed lots to be 44 by 132 feet, and the streets 66 feet wide running east and west, and 80 feet running north and south, except Twenty-first street which was 98 feet and width of lots 44 feet. There were some stakes on the block above where Shield’s house stood. I don’t know whether there were any on this block. E. Y. Smith removed some of them out of the way. I don’t think I have seen any of these stakes since 1856., I know nothing of Horbach’s taking any stakes away. I never measured between any two stakes on this plat. I know the distance only from the map and what Col. Miller told me. The map tells nothing and all I know about it is what has been told me. Col. Miller told me that Twenty-first street was 98 feet wide. If he was wrong, then my measurement was wrong. There is now no such block in the city of Omaha as block 172-2-, I know nothing except by its being checked on the map with pen and ink, and can’t swear this point of a stake, I have before testified to finding, was a corner stake. It looked something like one. I don’t know that the fence was on the line of lots on block 128-J-. I never measured between the stakes of any part of Scriptown. I know nothing about the correctness of my starting point of survey except from rumor and the data I have given. I cannot swear this ground pointed out by my survey is the same that was once called block 172-J.” B. E. B. Kennedy, sworn as a witness on behalf of the plaintiff, testified as follows: “I was with Miller and Horbach five or six years ago in an effort to locate block 172-J-. It was in the spring of 1868, I think. Ye were all on the ground and Horbach and Miller endeavored to locate this block. They did not agree as to its locality. Afterwards I prepared a quit claim deed for Miller in reference to a settlement. It -was conceded the block lay on the west side of Twenty-first street. This block has never been pointed out to me on the surface of the earth.” On the part of defendant, Horbach, Louis Shield testified as follows: “In 1868 I lived upon Horbach’s tract of land. I knew \"Wilgoskie. I remember Lorin Miller and him coming up there to survey a block that Miller told me lie owned, and they found it in my briclc yard. Miller came the first time with Kip. Second time with Wilgoslde. Kip staked it off about 35 feet further north than Wilgoskie did. I heard no objection made to it by Miller about location. Miller told me he-had. a block there, but would not hurt me. My brick yard lies west of Twenty-first street in Omaha, and one lot north of Nicholas street. Wilgoskie’s survey staked it about 35 feet further south than Kip did.” Chauncey Wiltze, testified on behalf of the defendant as follows: . “I was in Omaha in 1856 and 1857. There was very little surveying done. When the Poppleton and Byers map was made, A. D. Jones surveyed the city proper. Sixteenth street north of the creek was 66 feet wide. This was my base of operations in laying off PPorbach’s addition. P measured some of those lots of the old\\' survey, and P remember there was a variation, they did not hold out to what they purported to be.” John A. PPorbacli, on his own behalf, testified as follows: “P had some conversation with Pjorin Miller, in the fall of 1856, or spring of 1857. P was then living on land north of creek. The width of streets in Scriptown addition to Omaha was very indefinite. Miller told me there was vacant ground between his survey and the A. P). Jones survey or plat. PPe could not tell the width of it, but said it vailed. \\' P showed him some stakes between Sixteenth and Seventeenth streets near my south line, that did not range or correspond with what map claimed. PPe said they were not very accurate. P know Sixteenth street was sixty-six feet wide from surveys and measurements made by C. W. Slireve, surveyor, in 1856, in trying to find south line of block 180£, south of my pre-emption. P helped him to measure\\'from stakes on Sixteenth street north of where P lived. Stakes were oalc, marked and numbered with red chalk, and stood 12 to 14 inches above the ground. I obtained width of these streets in endeavoring to determine block 180^-, with Capt. Shreve. He was county surveyor. Any one could find stakes on north part of Sixteenth street from where I lived. The fence about what was known as Shields’ house, called block 128-J-, was built by Beeson. There was more than one enclosure by fence. There was a stock corral, and also a lot of hay stacks enclosed with fence. In 1860 I fenced the west part of that eighty acres with post and board fence, four or five boards high. Hunt had a building in the field after it was enclosed. I have paid the taxes on the property ever since. Kennedy came to my office in 1868, as attorney for Miller. He claimed he could identify the property Miller claimed. I told him Miller did not own such property. I never went up to the ground in controversy with Miller to locate a block. I did meet him at one time there and Kennedy was there and we were in my field near Twentieth street, where I had laid out an addition. Miller then said he could not locate it, but spoke of where he thought it was from his recollection. He failed to find it or anything near where it was. He did not claim to have any data whereby it could be located, only in a general way, that it was in the neighborhood of the brick yard. I have kept the fence up to this time. I have never seen Miller at all, except the time I have stated as being in 1868. I never recognized Miller’s claim. In fencing in surrounding lands, I necessarily enclosed block 172J.” In rebuttal, Lorin Miller testified as follows: “When I went there with Kennedy and Ilorbach, Horbacli asked me if I would not take land in some other place, as the block I claimed would interfere with his plat. I agreed to take eight lots in place of these. Horbacli wanted pay for taxes and fences, &c. I made a deed of the block to Horbacli, but destroyed it last year.” Horbacli, being recalled, testified as follows: “I demanded of him to pay me from $150, to $250, before I would deed anything. , I told Kennedy if Miller would pay me what I asked and guaranty me against any further expense on that old deed, I would give him some lots in my second addition but it was not in quantity half as much as block 172-|- as claimed. I never recognized Miller’s title at any time and never said I would deed him block 172J, or a like quantity.” The foregoing is the substance of the evidence introduced on the trial of the case. The court, at the request of Miller, gave several instructions, but no exception being taken to some, and the motion for a new-trial not alleging error in the giving of others, they were not considered in this court. The instructions passed upon here, are stated in the opinion-. The verdict below was in favor of Miller, and Horbach brought the case here by petition in error. Clinton Briggs, for plaintiff in error. I. A portion of the charge given by the court to the jury was not reduced to writing as\\' required by the provisions of the act of Feb. 18, 1873. General Statutes, Sec. 58, p. 262. This act makes it the imperative duty of the judge to reduce his instructions to writing, before giving the same to the jury, and this cannot be waived by counsel except in open court, and by the entering of such waiver in the record of the case. And the act further provides that if any charge, or parts thereof, are not reduced to writing, it “shall be error in the trial of the cause, and sufficient cause for the reversal of the judgment rendered therein.” The oral charge was certainly of no advantage to Horbach, and the court cannot say liow much, if any, it may liave prejudiced his case. It is not necessary to determine this question, for no matter whether, the charge is for or against the party objecting, he has the right to have the judgment reversed, and the cause sent back for a new trial; so says the act above mentioned. II. The verdict is not sustained by sufficient evidence. The petition describes by metes and bounds, a certain piece of land and claims it to be identical with the lots described in the deed. It was therefore incurp,bent on Miller to show to a reasonable certainty, that the land described in the petition was the identical land covered by the deed, i. e., block 172-a-. No attempt- was made to establish the location of the block by any of the original stakes, or remains of stakes, or anything else around its boundaries. But the attempt is made to establish the boundaries of block 128-|-, situated a quarter of a mile, perhaps, from the block in controversy. This is done for the purpose of getting a starting point. Now if this starting point was wrong, then everything about the measurement was wrong. \"We submit that on the evidence here given, that the verdict of the jury should be set aside. III. The answer denies Miller’s title, and then Horbach sets up title in himself acquired by an adverse possession of more than ten years. 1. It was competent for the grantor to interpose this defense as against his grantee or any one claiming under him. Stearns v. Elendersass, 9 Oush., é97. Tilton v. Emery, 17 New ELamp., 536. Brackett v. Persons Unknown, 53 Maine, 228. 2. “As a general doctrine it has too long been established to be now in the least degree controverted, that wliat the law deems a perfect possession,. if continued during the whole period which is provided by statute for tlie enforcement of tlie right of entry, is evidence of a fee.” Angelí on Limitations, See. 380. Bradstreet v. Huntington, 5 LJet., 338. LeMngwell v. Warren, 2 Black, 599. 3. \"When lands are held by adverse possession for the time prescribed by law, and an entry is made by the holder of the written title such party will be dispossessed, in ejectment brought by the adverse possessor. Lessee of Deváchtv. L. Wewsam, 3 Ohio, 57. Jackson v. Oltz, 8 Wend., 440. Gibson v. Bailey, 9 New LLamp., 168. 4. There are two classes of adverse possessors, one where the entry is under color of title, the other where the entry is without .color of right, by a mere intruder. In the former case the possession of the claimant is construed to be co-extensive with the premises as described in his paper title; in the latter case the possession is confined to the lands actually occupied. Angelí on Limitations, Sec. 400. Bynum v. Thompson, 3 Ired., Law, 578. Shackleford v. Smith, 5 Dana, 233. Kile v. Tubbs, 23 Oal., 431. This case belongs to the latter class. 5. \"What are the elements of adverse possession ? As in the case of an intruder. ITe must be in the actual possession for the period prescribed by the law. The possession must be continuous — not interrupted. It must be open and visible. It must be such as to indicate to the owner of the paper title that his possession is usurped, and his property appropriated by another. This gives him a right of action against tlie intruder, and under our law this right of action must continue for ten years before his rights are barred. Gend- Stat. Sec. 6 p. 525. The actual possession must be such as to amount to a disseizure. Miller v. Shaw, 7 Sergt. and Bawle, 129. Bell v. Long worth, 6 Lnd., 273. 6. But this question is presented. Did Ilorbach claim the property as his own against everybody else? If he did not, was it necessary he should do so? In this case the intention of Horbacli cannot admit of a doubt. He paid the taxes during the time of his occupation. This is very significant of his intention. Fa/rrar v. Fessenden, 39 New Hamp., 268. He maintained a fence around the land. He refused to convey the land to Miller when he demanded a deed. He denied Miller’s title. In this suit he claims as owner by virtue of the statute. There is no testimony in the case even tending to show that Horbach ever recognized Miller’s title. The most that can be claimed is that there was a talk about a compromise. But this could not prejudice ITorbach’s rights. State \\'Bant of Wisconsin v. Button, 11 Wis., 371. Emerson v. Boynton, 11 Gray, 395. E. Wakeley, for the defendant in error. I. No exception was taken or objection made to the manner of giving the verbal instruction. In the motion for a new trial, it was not objected that the instruction was verbal. The instructions were in the first instance wholly in writing; that in question was a mere response to an inquiry of the jury, on their return into court, and did not come within the provisions of the statute. II. The question of identity of the premises was solely one of fact, and on recognized principles, the verdict will not be disturbed, except in a very clear case-of error. Couusel opposed, criticizes Smith’s testimony as to the “point.” My learned and acute friend being more accustomed to investigate “points” of law, than “points” of corner lot stakes, failed to find the “point” in question. A jury of twelve intelligent men had no trouble in discovering it, and I think any impartial investigator, either lawyer- or layman, can find it without difficulty from the record. III. The instructions touching the statute of limitations, were correct; and I do not understand that plaintiff in error excepted to any of them. It is not necessary to parade authorities on the subject of adverse possession. In Angelí on Limitations, chap. 31, the authorities are fully cited and largely commented upon. The result of them clearly is, that there must not only be possession, but possession under a claim of right, for the full period of the statute. The fact of Horbacli’s enclosing the block in controversy, was no evidence that he claimed to own it, for the conclusive reason that he could not possibly enclose his own land completely surrounding Miller’s, without enclosing the latter. Taking the evidence all together, the jury were clearly justified in coming to the conclusion that there was no such claim of ownership by Horbach for the whole period of ten years, as to entitle him to the benefit of the statute. IY. Yery many of the authorities hold the amendment of the statute of limitations does not apply to causes of action existing prior to the change. And all of them hold that the new statute does not apply to existing causes of action, unless a reasonable time is allowed after the taking effect of the new law, and before the new period shall elapse. In this case I submit that there was not a reasonable time for bringing the action between the first day of July, 1869, and the time when the ten years after Horbach. enclosed the block in controversy expired.',\n",

The statute is a penal one, and the plaintiff must bring himself strictly within its provisions to recover. Parish v. Railroad, 63 Mo. 287; Potter’s Dwarris on Statutes and Const., 245; State v. Reid, 125 Mo. 43; Dudley v. Tel. Co., 54 Mo. App. 391; Wilson v. Burton, 96 Mo. App. 686. (2) The defendant was in actual possession of the land at the time plaintiff erected the fence, and which she cut. Plaintiff’s possession was a prerequisite to an action of trespass. Cook v. Redman, 45 Mo. App. 397; Lindenbower v. Bentty, 86 Mo. 515; Brown v. Center, 52 Mo. 46. (3) The plaintiff’s first instruction is erroneous and should not have been given. Hedges v. Pollard, 149 Mo. 216; Blair v. Smith, 16 Mo. 275; Brummell v. Harris, 162 Mo. 397; Barnes v. Allison, 166 Mo. 96; Harding v. Wright, 119 Mo. 91; Whitaker v. Whitaker, 157 Mr. 354; Sell v.

(1) Plaintiff’s statement, by express terms, was based upon section 4573, Revised Statutes 1899. It states a cause of action under the first clause of said section. Wilson v. Burton, 96 Mo. App. 686. (2) While plaintiff insists that his statement is clearly good under the statute, it will be further noticed that defendant took no exceptions to the form of the statement previous to nor during the trial. The law is well established in this State — indeed wherever the common law is known and practiced — that although a petition .may he defective, yet, if it appear after verdict that the verdict could not have been given or the judgment rendered without proof' of the matter omitted to be stated, the defect will be cured and the judgment will not be arrested.'

Disputed Boundary of City Lots—Common Grantors—Deference to South Boundary of Block — Support of Finding — Ancient Fence.—In an action to determine the disputed boundary of city lots deeded by common grantors, each of which referred to the south boundary line of the block for measurement, it is held that a finding by the court that the location of the south boundary of the block is determined by the location of an ancient fence, which has constituted such south boundary for nearly fifty years, is abundantly supported by the evidence. Id.—Bights of Grantor to Fix Boundary.—The grantor owning the lots granted to each grantee had the right to fix the boundaries of the land which was conveyed. Id.—Change in Northern Boundary—Deduction in Size of Block by Opening Street—South Boundary Unaffected.—Notwithstanding a fence located as the north boundary was mistaken, since the location of a street opened on said boundary reduced the size of the block, and the northern fence was changed thirty-five feet farther south, yet this did not affect the fence constituting the south boundary, which always remained unchanged. Id.—Description of Land Granted.—Any description of land granted will suffice, which identifies it with such certainty that the specific parcel intended to be granted can be ascertained either by the calls of the instrument as applied to the land, or by the descriptive features of the grant. Id.—Evidence—Declaration Against Interest.—A declaration by the owner of the land of a loss on the north boundary, and of the change therein, owing to the street, of thirty-five feet in the location of the north fence, was admissible as being against his interest. Id.—Declaration of Dependant as Purchaser prom Administrator.— The declaration of the defendant appealing, made at the time of his purchase from the administrator of the deceased owner of the land that he was aware of the dispute as to the location of the north line, and that he would be satisfied to take a diminished size of lot on that account, was admissible as being a declaration against his interest, and also an indication of what property he .was purchasing and paying for.

Injunction — Sidewalk — Boundary of City Lot — Conflicting Evidence. In this action to restrain the city from building a sidewalk on property claimed by the plaintiff the controlling fact to be determined was the true location of a boundary of the property. The evidence was conflicting. There was competent evidence to support the contention of the city that the proposed line of the walk is in a public street, and not upon the plaintiff’s property. Although there was evidence tending to prove the contrary, the finding against the plaintiff on conflicting testimony can not be overthrown in this court. 2. Public Street — Private Occupation — Paramount Right of Public. The rule declared in Giffen v. City of Olathe, 44 Kan. 342, 24 Pac. 470, that persons occupying any portion of a street will be presumed to hold it subject to the paramount right of the public is followed. 3.

Error to Berrien ; Coolidge, J. Submitted January 20, 1905. (Docket No. 95.) Decided January 24, 1906. Trespass quare clausum fregit by George Toney against Ered Knapp. There was judgment for defendant, and plaintiff brings error. Affirmed. This case was tried before the court without a jury, and the following finding of facts and law made: “ In 1859 Wright Buzzard owned 80 acres in section 26, Berrien township. William P. Weed then owned 91 acres directly west of said 80 acres. Buzzard had no means of going from his farm to the public highway, running north and south'on west side of Weed’s land; and on March 3, 1859, he obtained a written license from Weed, by which the latter granted to Buzzard the right to use the south 20 feet of said 91 acres as a private road, leading from the Buzzard farm to the public highway. A few years later a public highway was built on the north side of the Buzzard and Weed farms, which connected with the north and south road mentioned above. “ Buzzard and his successors and grantees used said 20-foot strip as a private way from the Buzzard farm to the public highway continuously from 1859 to 1895. “ The plaintiff is the owner of the east 31 acres of said 91 acres, and derives his title from William P. Weed. Mrs. Sarah Knapp, the mother of defendant, became the owner of the Buzzard farm of 80 acres in 1872, and derived her title from said Buzzard through his grantees. “ Weed, the owner of the 91 acres over which the private way runs, died some time prior to 1876, and in that year his heirs conveyed the land to plaintiff’s grantor. The plaintiff has title to the east 31 acres of said 91-acre piece. “ In 1864 Buzzard conveyed his farm of 80 acres to one Tuttle, and from that time to 1895 Tuttle and his successors and grantees were in possession of said private way. This road appears to have been used openly, continuously, and exclusively by the said Buzzard and his successors and grantees from 1859 to 1895. The following concession is made : “ ' It is also conceded that Wright Buzzard and his grantees had possession, open, visible, and under claim of right, of the premises in dispute continuously until the highway was laid in 1884, and that they used it some from that time up to the time the fence was huilt in 1895, but did not use it as much as they did previous to 1884.’ “ Sarah Knapp became the owner of the Buzzard farm in 1872 as a successor of Buzzard, and has since owned it. “ In 1895 the plaintiff, being the owner of the 31 acres referred to, closed up said right of way by building a fence across the same, and also built a fence along his south line inclosing said right of way with his land. Kingsley Knapp, acting for Sarah Knapp, shortly thereafter tore down such fence across the right of way. Toney then sued Kingsley Knapp in an. action of trespass, which is still pending in this court. The fence was rebuilt by plaintiff in 1895, and the right of way was not used afterwards by defendant, or those under whom he acted. The plaintiff maintained the fence, and was in the continuous, open, and visible peaceable possession of the land in question under color and claim of right, hostile to defendant and the parties under whom he held, and grubbed out the so-called right of way and raised crops on it, and was in such peaceable possession as aforesaid, from 1895 till the time of the alleged trespass in the spring of 1903, when defendant tore down the fence running east and west on the south line of plaintiff’s land, inclosing said right of way with his lands. “In the spring of 1903 the defendant, acting for Sarah Knapp, tore down the fence and removed it to the land of plaintiff. This is the act of trespass alleged by the plaintiff and for which suit is brought. “I find the following conclusions of law: “1. I find that the writing of March 3, 1859, entered into between Weed and Buzzard, was a personal license, and conveyed no rights running with the land. , “2. I find that such license became revocable by the death of Weed, and that consequently it was revoked as early as 1876. “3. I find that such license became revocable by the conveyance of Buzzard to Tuttle in 1864, and that Tuttle acquired no right to use said right of way by such deed. “4. I find that the use and possession of the private way from 1872 to 1895 by Sarah Knapp was open, visible, continuous, and adverse; that such possession was under a claim of right at least from the time of Weed’s death in 1876; and that, having continued for more than 15 years, the right to use such private way became vested in Sarah Knapp by prescription. “5. I find that the possession of said Sarah Knapp was not permissive, but hostile, under a claim of right, and that no written or express notice was necessary from Mrs. Knapp to the plaintiff or his grantors of such claim, as the plaintiff and his grantors must have known the character of her possession and acquiesced in it. “6. I find, therefore, that the defendant is not guilty of the trespass alleged in plaintiff’s declaration, and judgment is therefore rendered in favor of defendant and against the plaintiff for his costs of suit, to be taxed.” Coy W.

Mechanics’ Lien: non-lienable impbovements. A retaining wall though it serves the purpose of a fence, and a driveway extending from the .street up to the side of the residence, are not such improvements that a mechanic's lien can he maintained for the material used in the construction thereof when contracted for separately from the building; statutes of other states and their constructions reviewed. 2. Practice, Appellate: assignment or ebAobs. Under the present statute no formal assignment of errors is required. Appeal from the Jackson Cirmit Court.-? — Hon. J. H. Slover, Judge. Reversed and remanded (with directions).- Karnes, Holmes & Krmthoff .and S. C. Douglass, for appellants. (1) A mechanic’s lien is purely a creature of the statute, and derives its existence wholly from positive enactments. Edgar v. Salisbury, 17 Mo. 272; Camsius v. Merrill, 65 Ill. 67; Phillips on Mechanics’ Liens [2 Ed.] sec. 9; Grant v. Vandercook, 8 Abb. Pr. N. S. (N. Y.) 455; Mfg. Co. v. Hazlett, 3 Brewst. (Pa.) 98. Therefore, there can be no lien other than that which the statute creates. (2) The supreme court of this state has construed the words of this statute, and declared that the terms “building” and “improvement,” as used in the statute, are synonymous. Collins v. Mott, 45 Mo. 100; Phillips on Mechanics’ Liens [2 Ed.] sec. 174; R. S. 1889, sec. 6705. (3) A fence or stone wall for the purposes of a fence is not a build ing or improvement, in the. sense that the statute confers a lien for its construction. Wherever it has been held that fences come within the statute, it. has been where the statute specially provides a lien for the building of fences. Phillips on Mechanics’ Liens [2 Ed. ] secs. 164, 165, 170; McDermott v. Palmer, 4 Seld. (N. Y.) 383; Bank v. Curtiss, 18 Conn. 342; Gamsius v. Merrill, 65 Ill. 67; Beers v. Knapp, 5 Ben. (U. S. Dist.

(4) In the case at bar, the stone walls or fences were built under contracts, separate and distinct from those under which the residence proper, the barn and other buildings appurtenant thereto were constructed. No part of the materials furnished by the respondent was used elsewhere than in such stone walls or fences. Under such circumstances the statute gives no lien — but otherwise, if built under one general contract for the residence, walks, fences, etc., as is oftentimes done. Phillips on Mechanics’ Li'ens [2 Ed.] sec. 165; Henry v. Plitt, 84 Mo. 237; Stone Co. v. Gray, 43 Mo. App. 671; McDermott v. Claas, 104 Mo. 24, 25. Crysler, Sherlock & Stearns, for respondent. (1) The appellants’ brief contains no assignment of errors, as required by rule number 18 of this court. Honeycutt v. Bailroad, 40 Mo. App. 677-8, and cases cited. (2) Answering the second subdivision of appellants’ brief, the respondent says that the opinion of the supreme court in Collins v. Mott, 45 Mo. 100, upon examination will show that no question covered by that decision is’in issue in the case at bar, and it is no authority in this case. The supreme court has defined “improvement” to mean an “amelioration of the freehold.” Koenig v. Mueller, 39 Mo. 168. (3) “The •courts were at one time inclined to construe the lien law strictly against those who sought to avail themselves oí its benefits,” but the better doctrine now is that those statutes are highly remedial in their nature •and should receive a liberal construction to advance the just and beneficent objects had in view in their passage; “their great aim and purpose is to do substantial justice between the parties, and this should never be lost sight of in giving them a practical construction.” Dewitt v. Smith, 63 Mo. 266, at bottom. 'The court of appeals has followed this case in McAdow v. Sturtevant, 41 Mo. App. 225. (4) Appellants contend in the fourth subdivision of their brief that “the stone walls and fences were built under contracts separate and distinct from those under which the residence proper, barn and other buildings and appurtenances thereto were constructed; that the contractors were different, etc. (see their brief), and that under such circumstances the statute gives no lien. Appellant’s house was erected under different contracts, let by Yan Brunt, but “the house as an entirety,” in “the sense of one contract for the whole,” “never was let to anybody,” and the walls, steps, coping, posts, etc., for which respondent furnished material is and was a part of appellant’s general improvements, and the walls, are a part of his place “as an entirety.” These walls, steps, coping, posts, etc., were being put in as part of the general improvements at the same time the mechanics were engaged in building the house. The house was not completed until after 'February, 1890, and appellant moved into his house in May, 1890. The walls, posts, coping and other improvements are all appurtenant to appellant’s buildings and premises, and were constructed at the same time, under plans and specifications «made by the architect for the house, and are wholly on appellant’s premises, and constitute-apart of his place “as an entirety.” In the case of Henry v. Plitt, 84 Mo. 241, a lien for a sidewalk was-given. The lien is given upon “the idea that the-work, or labor, or materials, have been a benefit to the realty or enhanced its value. “Hohhour v. Meer, 59 Mo. 436; Pullis v. Hoffman, 28 Mo. App. 669. None-of these erections or improvements serve any public purpose, and the lien ought to attach where the-improvements are on the premises. Stone Go. v. Gray,. 43 Mo. .676-7. The case of McDermott v. Claas, 104 Mo. 24, decides that sidewalks which are laid in the-public street, and which the public are entitled to use, and are laid upon ground dedicated to public use, are-lienable if built under the same contract with the dwelling on the adjacent premises, reaching in principle, we-think, beyond that contended for by respondent in this-case.\",\n",

Ejectment — Misdescription of Property — Amendment to Petition— No Error. No error is committed in allowing a petition in ejectment to be amended by changing the description of the property sought to be recovered, where no contention is made that the bar of the statute of limitations has fallen between the beginning of the action and the making of the amendment. 2. Will — Reference to Property Devised — Sufficiently Definite. Where a will, after disposing of the southwest quarter of the southwest quarter and the northwest quarter of the northwest quárter of a section of land owned by the testator, in devising the remainder of the section speaks of each of these tracts as “the 40 acres” already so disposed of, although in fact neither contains quite that area, such reference does not justify an inference that by the first devise anything was intended to pass excepting the two quarter quarters described, as laid out by the government surveyors. 3. Will — Construction by Probate Court — Evidence. The admission of evidence of the construction of a will by the probate court held to be nonprejudicial, because the interpretation in support of which it was offered was correct as a matter of law. 4. Ejectment — Boundaries of Land — Recitals in Deeds — Evidence. Where the owner of a tract of land claims that he .and his grantors acquired an adjoining strip by a boundary agreement and by adverse possession, no error is committed against him in admitting in evidence the deeds through which he claims, and which make no reference to such strip. 5. Same — Tax Rolls — Evidence. In such situation no error is committed by admitting evidence that the property continued to be carried on the tax rolls by the original descriptions. 6. Trial — Evidence—Conclusion of Witness. The overruling of.objections to testimony on the ground of its stating the mere conclusions of the witness held not prejudicial where the facts were fully developed. 7. Ejectment — Adverse Possession — Evidence. The evidence held not to show conclusively that the defendant had acquired title by a boundary agreement or adverse possession. 8. Same. Instructions requested regarding adverse possession held to have been properly refused. 9. Same — Instructions—No Error. The instruction's given held not to afford ground of reversal.

TAX BILL: Improving Private Property. If\" one-half the strip sixty feet wide belonged to defendant, a ¡ special tax bill issued against his abutting property in payment for the improvements constructed thereon by the city is void. 3. -: -: Estoppel: Common Law Dedication. Whether or not the attempt of the city to condemn a thirty-foot strip of defendant’s lot for street purposes was void for that notice by publication did not amount to due process of law, the defendant may be estopped to assert titl\\'e to said strip by a common law dedication thereof to city use; and such dedication may be established by evidence showing his intention to dedicate, acts done to carry out the intention, and an acceptance by the city; and the facts shown by the city in this case, whether it be considered an action at law or a suit in equity, being sufficient to show a common law dedication of said thirty-foot strip to the city, the tax bill levied against the remaining part of his lot for the grading, paving and guttering of the street of which said strip was a part, was not issued for the improvement of private property, and hence was not void. Appeal from St. Louis Circuit Court.—Hon. G. A. Wurdeman, Judge. Affirmed. H. A. Loevy for appellants. (1) The street improvement work for which the special tax bill sued on was issued was done on private property, therefore the tax bill is void. (2) The attempted statutory condemnation of appellant’s 30 feet of ground is unconstitutional and therefore null and void, because: (a) Appellant was not made a party by name to the condemnation case. ■ Wherefore he is not bound by same, (b) Section 9415 on which the city’s condemnation proceedings intended to condemn the western 30 feet of appellant’s lot for continuation of Dickson Street are based, is unconstitutional, being class legislation, (c) The method of notice provided for therein is not dne process of law: It discriminates) between residents of the city and other residents of the State, by providing for personal notice to the former by service by the city marshal and to the latter by publication as if they were non-residents of the State instead of citizens of the same State, (d) Publication to residents who cannot be found is not publication to non-residents and cannot be substituted, (e) It does not even describe his 30\\' feet of land nor even .the entire lot which might have attracted his attention if he had ever seen the so-called newspaper. (3) There was no common law dedication thereof, because there was no intent by appellant to dedicate, there was merely use by the public of an undefined roadway, straggling within a sixty foot limit like any other country road without bonds, partly across the western end of his tract, and partly on his neighbors. That did not create a common-law dedication. Carpenter v. St. Joseph, 263 Mo. 714. (a) Proof of intention by owner to wave his right is necessary, (b) A common-law dedication requires not only intent by owner but also acceptance by the city. . Mere user does not establish a street. (c) If the right of way depends on user, the width of the way is measured by its character, for an easement cannot be broader than the user. (4) The semi-annual statement required by statute showing the city’s general revenue and debts 1907-8-9 before special tax assessments can be levied, was not complied with. Hence the bill sued-on is void. Sec. 9413, R. S. 1909. Frank J. Quinn and Geo. O. Durham for respondent. (1) Appellant having failed to demur to the evidence or request a directed finding for defendant conceded that plaintiff had made a prima-facie case and cannot complain that the court did not of its own motion direct a finding, for defendant. 38 Cyc. 1540; Dickey v. Porter, 203 Mo. 20. (2) Letting tax-bill in without objection and failing to demur to the evidence conceded owner ship and assignment and in effect conceded respondent’s ownership and right to maintain a suit for the tax-bill. Dickey v. Porter, 203 Mo. 1; Pratt v. Conway, 148 Mo. 299. (3) The evidence was sufficient to establish a common-law dedication and estoppel as against defendant; for: Appellant was claiming certain taxes alleged to have been illegally exacted of him and these taxes were not recoverable. Christy v. City, 20 Mo. 143; Roberts v. Latham, 134 Mo. 466; Pritchard v. Bank, 200 S. W. 666. And the return thereof by the City of Kirkwood was a valuable consideration which could be conditioned as the city saw fit. Under these conditions the \\'city agreed to return the money in consideration of a dedication of Dickson Street. The money was paid and accepted. The terms of such payment and the condition with reference to the dedication was clearly brought home to appellant and he acquiesced therein, ordered his fence removed, had a new fence built on new line, and had property resurveyed and platted on new line. The whole constituted a dedication and estoppel to assert that the street was private property. Naylor v. Harrison-ville, 207 Mo. 341.',\n",

The plaintiffs instituted suit in the Circuit Court of the State of Oregon in and for Washington County, for the purpose of securing a decree for the specific performance of an alleged oral contract relating to the devise of real property by will. ' The complaint alleges, at paragraph XII: “That Benjamin Scholfield died within Washington County, Oregon, on the 24th day of June, 1917, and at the time of his death was the owner, amongst other properties, of all the following bounded and described real property situate within Washington County, Oregon, and more particularly bounded and described as follows, to wit: “Beginning at a point on the base line in Section 3, Township 1 South, Eange 3 West of the Willamette Meridian, in Washington County, Oregon, where the West boundary of county road number 528 (prolonged) would intersect said base line; thence South 0 degrees 29 minutes West following West boundary of said road number 528, 2273.5 feet to the South line of the said McLinn D.

P. Ey. Co.’s right of way, and excepting a tract of land deeded to - on the - day of •-, 19 — .” The complaint further alleges: “That at the time of his death he left the following heirs at law: “Ruth A. Cornelius, a daughter. “William T. Scholfield, a son. “Rebecca Ellen Goodin, a daughter. “Mary Jane Ward, a daughter. “Harriet Eva Yoder, a daughter. “Claude Cook, a grandson. “Earl Cook, a grandson. “Iva Clark, a granddaughter. ” Paragraph XV alleges a promise to devise: “That on or about the 15th day of June, 1909, the above named plaintiffs were residents and inhabitants of Clatsop County, Oregon, and the plaintiff W. A. Goodin was at that time, and had been for a long period of time immediately preceding said date, engaged in the general contracting business, and was, and had been for many years immediately prior thereto, a successful contractor; and that upon said date a verbal and parol agreement was made and entered into by and between the plaintiffs upon the one side, and Benjamin Scholfield, deceased, upon the other side, and wherein and whereby it was stipulated, understood and agreed to that for and in consideration of the promises, covenants and agreements hereinafter contained and to be performed by the plaintiffs herein, the said Benjamin Scholfield undertook, promised, covenanted and agreed that he would make, execute, publish and declare a valid last will and testament wherein and whereby he would bequeath and devise all of the real property herein-above described in paragraph XII to the above named plaintiff Rebecca Ellen Goodin, and that upon his death he would leave such valid last will and testament bequeathing and devising to the said plaintiff Rebecca Ellen Goodin said real property set forth in paragraph XII in fee simple and that she would, at his death and by the terms of said last will and testa ment, become the absolute owner in fee simple, free and clear of all liens, claims and incumbrances, of all of the real property described in said paragraph XII.” Paragraph XVI avers the consideration: “That said last will and testament was to be executed aforesaid for and in consideration that the plaintiffs, who were then residing at Astoria, Clatsop County, Oregon, would remove from their said residence to and upon the real property hereinabove described and make their home and remain thereon until the said Benjamin Scholfield and Sarah V. Scholfield, his wife, should both become deceased; that the plaintiffs should make all necessary improvements upon said real property at their own expense, and maintain and keep up all improvements then being thereon, and that they would pay all taxes and assessments, of every kind and nature, levied and to be levied and collectible against said land, and to keep all buildings and improvements thereon in good repair and to pay to Benjamin Scholfield as long as he should live an annuity of $100 per annum, and in the event he should die before his wife, then in that event, to pay to her, the said Sarah V. Scholfield, said annuity of $100 per annum for and during the term of her natural life.” Paragraph XVII is as follows: “That said agreement and all the terms thereof were fully agreed to and accepted by the said Benjamin Scholfield upon the one side, and by the plaintiffs upon the other.” Paragraph XVIII relates to the delivery of the possession of the farm by Benjamin Scholfield to plaintiffs, the paying of the alleged annuity, and the construction of valuable improvements thereon, and paragraph XX avers that in order to carry out said oral agreement, plaintiff Goodin abandoned Ms said contracting business. Tbe complaint alleges tbat Benjamin Scbolfield died June 24, 1917, but tbat he did not perform his part of said agreement, in that although he made his last will and testament, only a portion of such real estate set forth in paragraph XII was devised to plaintiff Bebecca Ellen Goodin, a tract containing about 17.70 acres thereof having been left to the heirs of said Benjamin Scholfield. It is further alleged that the last will of Benjamin Scholfield was, bn August 2, 1917, duly admitted to probate, and that one J. W. Shute was on that date appointed, and duly qualified, as executor thereof. By the answer of the defendants, the sole issue presented is, whether or not the contract alleged was entered into between the plaintiffs, or either of them, and Benjamin Scholfield, and whether the same was performed by the plaintiffs. The court found: “That on the fifteenth day of June, 1919, plaintiffs were residents and inhabitants of Clatsop County, Oregon, and the plaintiff W. A. Goodin, was then, and had been for a long period of time * * engaged in the general contracting business * * ; that upon said date a parol agreement was made and entered into by and between the plaintiffs and Benjamin Scholfield, wherein it was * * agreed that for and in consideration of the promises and covenants * * to be performed by the plaintiffs as alleged in their complaint, the said Benjamin Scholfield undertook, promised, covenanted and agreed that he would make, execute, publish and declare a valid last will and testament, wherein and whereby he would bequeath and devise all of the real property hereinabove described to the plaintiff Bebecca Ellen Goodin, and that upon his death he would leave such valid last will and testament, bequeathing and devising to the said plaintiff Rebecca Ellen Goodin said real property * * in fee simple. “That said agreement and all the terms thereof were fully agreed to and accepted by the said Benjamin Scholfield upon one side and the plaintiffs upon the other. “That on the tenth day of October, 1909, by virtue of and in pursuance to the terms of said parol agreement, and for and in consideration of the promise to devise and bequeath to said plaintiff Rebecca Ellen Goodin the said real property, the plaintiffs removed from their residence in Astoria, Oregon, to and upon the above described lands, and * * in pursuance of said parol agreement Benjamin Scholfield delivered over to such plaintiffs the absolute and exclusive possession of said real property, and that from said date and thereafter until the death of said Benjamin Scholfield, they continued to pay to him the said annuity of $100, and that thereafter and # * until the death of the said Sarah V.

Railroad Companies—Operation op Railroad by Lessee—Duty to Fence Track—Injury to Stock—Liability por Negligence.—A railroad company which operates a railroad as lessee thereof has the same duty as would be imposed upon the lessor, if operating the same, to keep its tracks properly fenced and in suitable repair, as required by section 485 of the Civil Code, and for negligence in failing to do so the lessee is liable to the owner for injury to or loss of any domestic animals escaping upon the track without the fault of the owner thereof. Id.—Construction op Statute—Gates Part op Fence.—Gates constructed in connection with the fence for the convenience of the owner of the adjacent property are a part of the fence, and the railroad company is under the same duty to erect the gates in the first instance and keep them in repair as it is in regard to any other part of the fence; and they must be so securely adjusted that animals cannot, by pressing against them, cause them to open and escape upon the track. Id.—Prima Facie Case op Negligence.—Where there was evidence that the gate on plaintiff’s land was out of repair and was not good and sufficient for the purpose, and that defendant had notice of that fact, and that needed repairs requested were not made until after the loss and injury to animals escaping through the defective gate, without the fault of their owner, such facts, unexplained, made a prima facie ease of negligence against the defendant. Id.—Plaintiff not Required to Explain Opening op Gate—Burden op Proof.—Plaintiff was not required to explain how the defective gate came to be open; but it being known by the defendant to be defective, and sufficient time having elapsed to make the necessary repairs, the burden was upon the defendant to show that plaintiff’s mules, which may have pushed open the gate, did not escape through defendant’s negligence; and if it failed to sustain such burden, it failed to excuse its negligence. Id.—Opening op Defective Gate by Animals—Liability op Depend-ant Unaffected.—The fact that the defective gate which could not be securely fastened was pushed open by plaintiff’s animals could not affect the liability of the railroad company for the killing or maiming of the same, after having been charged with notice of the defective condition of the gate. Td.—Instructions—Bequest as to Nonsuit and Fence—Modification —Negligence as to Gate and Condition.—It appearing that a non-suit had been granted as to a second cause of action merely for negligent operation of defendant’s ears, and that the jury were properly instructed as to the nature of the cause of action to be considered/ the court properly modified a requested instruction stating the fact of such nonsuit, and that the only question to be considered by the jury was “whether defendant has or has not maintained a good and sufficient fence along its right of way,” by omitting all reference to such nonsuit, and giving in lieu of the request: “You are not to consider any testimony as to carelessness or negligence except as relates to the gate and its condition.” Id.—Sufficiency of Complaint.—Held, that the complaint is sufficient to charge the defendant with liability. It was not necessary tu allege that the defendant was the owner of the railroad. Id.—Motion for Nonsuit—Beview upon Appeal from Order Denying New Trial.—It is held that the motion for a nonsuit for insufficiency of the evidence for the plaintiff was properly overruled; but that the ruling thereupon is reviewable upon appeal from an order denying a motion for a new trial.

In an action for the breach of a covenant in a lease, evidence of the value of the lease is not admissible, because such value is not the measure of the damages for the breach of a particular covenant in it. A tenant after having been in possession of certain premises for seven years signed a new lease by which he agreed “ to keep the fences in proper repair, the material for which to be furnished by the lessor.” The landlord did not furnish any material, and the tenant did not repair the fences. Held, (1) that the covenant to keep the fences in repair was absolute and not qualified by the words “the material for which to be furnished by the lessor; ” (2) that the tenant was at liberty, and it was his duty, to use such suitable material as was on the premises to repair the fences, and if the landlord failed to furnish material when requested he could purchase it, and deduct the price from his rent; (8) that the tenant was not entitled directly or indirectly to any abatement from the rent, based on the nonperformance of his own covenant. Argued Feb. 10, 1896. Appeals, Nos. 355, 356 and 357, Jan. T., 1895, by defendant, from judgments of C. P. Delaware Co., Sept. T., 1893, No. 75, Dec.

The annual rent was $300, payable quarterly. The rent due July 1, 1893, was distrained for and the property replevied. Similar action was had for the rent due October 1, 1893, and January 1, 1894. The issue in these three several suits in replevin was made upon the tenant’s plea of no rent in arrear. The three issues were tried together. The facts appear by the charge of the court below and the opinion of the Supreme Court. Clayton, P. J., charged as follows: The great question you have to decide will be how much rent is due the landlord under this lease. The lease has been given in evidence and you have heard what the defense is. According to the terms of the lease, some $375 are due; that is to say, that if you find that the landlord has kept his covenant, then you will find there is $375 due for rent, and you will find the value of the property distrained, and that will be the valuation put upon it by the tenant himself when he gave his bond. [The defense set up to the landlord’s claim is, that by the terms of the lease, the fences are to be kept in good ordinary repair; you will know what a good ordinary fence is; one that is sufficient to restrain cattle, the usual kind, the unbreachy; no one is bound to keep up fences against breachy cattle. The fence ought to be sufficient to restrain ordinary cattle; that is the kind of fence a farmer requires. One that will protect his crops from trespass committed by other cattle, and that will sufficiently confine his own stock. The fence law of Pennsylvania is in some confusion, and it is sufficient for me to say to you that that kind, of a fence, at least under this lease, is required; under the lease offered in evidence here, the kind of fence that should be kept up on that property is one that would restrain ordinary cattle. The duty of maintaining this fence, by the lease is specifically set out, — the fences are to be reasonably good; the landlord is to furnish material, and the tenant is to perform the labor of putting up the fences; that is the pinch of the case.] [1] You will have to decide which of these two parties are in default. [If you find that the tenant performed his part, was always willing to put up the fences, gave notice to the landlord, requested the materials to be furnished, then it was the landlord’s duty to furnish the necessary materials, and if he failed to do it, or if she failed to do it, — it appears that the landlord in this case is a lady, — if the landlord failed to furnish the necessary material, having notice that they were necessary, and that they were wanted, then I instruct you that the tenant is entitled to set off against the landlord’s claim of rent whatever damages he has sustained, and the damages are to be measured by taking the rental value of the property, with good ordinary fences, and its rental value in the condition it was then'in, and I instruct you that the rental value is settled between the parties. The rental value of this property between the parties is $300 a year in good condition, so you need give yourselves no concern about finding out what the property was worth. It was worth $300; the parties have settled that by their own papers. It was worth $300 with good ordinary fences; in addition to this $300, it was worth the' labor necessary to plant these fences.] [2] [Now, you will observe, that the lease is but for one year, and can be terminated at the end of any year. It would therefore be unreasonable to ask this tenant, at his own expense, to put up fences that should enure to some other tenant after the expiration of his lease.] [3] This, I suppose, is the reason why the parties stipulated that they should be mutually liable to do certain things; that is to say, the tenant would not wish to expend unnecessary labor to put up first-class fences only for a year, and the landlord would not be willing to expend a large amount of money putting up any fences that were unnecessary, because his land is in the proximity of the built-up parts of the city of Chester, and you will notice by the terms of the agreement that the landlord has the right to sell off lots, and the probabilities are that the lots will not be used for farming purposes for years, and there is an agreement, gentlemen, and an agreement made by the parties is the law between the parties. There is nothing unreasonable or unlawful in the agreement. [The agreement is that the farm shall be kept up in good repair; the fences shall be kept in good repair; and all material necessary for that purpose shall be furnished by the landlord, and all the work necessary for planting and building the fences shall be done by the tenant.] [4] Now the landlord alleges that he was always willing to furnish the material. The defendant denies it, and the principal point of the case, and the one which I suppose will give you more trouble than any other point in the case, is the truth of these two allegations. Mr. Lyons admits that he refused to have anything to do with that and that whenever notice was given to him, or complaints were given to him, he referred Mr. Wood to Mr. Elldnton. [Mr. Wood says that he repeatedly requested Mr. Elkinton to furnish material; Mr. Elkinton says he required a list of the material, which was never furnished him, and that is the dispute between them.] [5] Now you have all the evidence upon that subject. You haye the testimony of the witnesses. [The strongest testimony in the case is that of the son of the defendant, who is absent, but whose affidavit was read, and which is to have the same effect as if he were on the stand and testified to what he has set forth. This is denied by the other side. They take the stand and say what is said there is not true, and the tenant produces a letter from Mr. Elkinton. That letter will be for you, which would seem to a certain extent to corroborate the tenant, in which he says, “ Respected Friend: Thy favor of the 15th is at hand. As far as the cutting off and opening up of the land is concerned there has been nothing done outside of our mutual understanding and acquiescence. This we all settled too long ago to take up now. On the other hand thy fulfillment of the contract made with me regarding keeping up the fences has been very unsatisfactory to me, consequently I do not see my way to make the appointment.” Now that would seem to indicate that the tenant had requested an interview and that Mr. Elkinton had refused it because something that had gone before was not satisfactory.] [6] [Now you will have to wrestle with the difficulties between these parties, and the ques tion for you will be whether the landlord here has performed his part of the contract, or whether he has been excused from performing it because of the conduct of the tenant.] [7] If what Mr. Elldnton and Mr. Lyons say is true, then it would seem that the fault was with the tenant. They say that all they requested was an estimate of the materials wanting and that that estimate never came. The tenant says that they refused to talk with him about it; that they refused to allow him for what he had done; that the $10.00 that they had agreed to pay him was never paid, and that there was a difference between them about the expense of putting up the fence around the house, and that they would not allow him for the materials he had furnished; upon the other hand it appears that Bunting’s bills were paid and that there was an allowance made on work as well as material in putting up the fence around the house. So, gentlemen, the parties differ, and the very object of the jury is to settle the differences between the parties, who are witnesses here. If you shall come to the conclusion that these fences were permitted to get out of repair and remain out of repair so that the tenant could not restrain his stock, and could not reasonably use the land for the purposes for which it was rented, and that the fault was with the landlord, and not with the tenant, then you may allow the tenant damages, and the damages, the measure of damages, will be the difference in the value of the land with and without the fences. The value of the land with the fences in good repair was $300, and the labor of the tenant necessary to put up the fences; that was the value of the land with the fences in ordinary repair. What was it worth for the purpose for which it was rented, without the fences being out of repair ? That is a question you will have to decide if you find the fault was with the landlord. If you find the fault was with the tenant, then the landlord is entitled to the whole of it. If you find therefore for the tenant, you will find the difference in the value of the property as rented between $300 a year and the necessary labor of putting up the fences, and what it was really worth for the purposes for which it was rented with the fences out of repair, and that difference you will deduct from the rent now claimed. If, upon the other hand, you find the fault was with the tenant, then the landlord would be entitled to his whole rent, and, as I before stated, you need not bother yourselves dividing up what you find between these three suits; just inform us whether you find for the landlord or the tenant, and if you find for the landlord, how much you find is due him for rent, making the proper deduction if you find the landlord was in fault in not furnishing the materials for fences; then we will mould your verdict. I do not see that I can say anything further to you. I will leave the question of fact entirely for you. You are the judges of the testimony and you will decide the questions according to the weight of the testimony. It is agreed, if you find for the landlord, that you find a certain sum due for rent.' You will find the value of the goods distrained to be $400. [So, gentlemen, you have just a simple question, whether there was or was not a breach of this contract on the part of the landlord. It all relates to the fencing. Just keep your minds upon that one point and your verdict will be right.] [8] You do not find any interest; just find the amount of rent due. That is a question to be settled hereafter. Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $100 in the first ease, $25.00 in the second case and $25.00 in the third case. Defendant appealed.

       "  'case_summary': \"Tainter vs. The Mayor of Morristown. 1. Upon a motion to dissolve, the allegations of the answer, supported by affidavits, must be taken as established. 2. The unlawful cutting down of fences, shade trees, and ornamental shrubbery is an irreparable injury, and, where established, will be suppressed by the preventive powers of this court. 3. A return of surveyors of the highways, coming up collaterally in this court, cannot be judged void, or disregarded for any irregularity or deficiency, if the surveyors had jurisdiction of the subject matter. 4. It is not necessary that a commission be appointed to ascertain the lines of an ancient highway before proceeding to remove encroachments alleged to be, thereon, when the true limits and courses thereof can be as-eew ,,V.au with accuracy and certainty, and, in fact, are bo ascertained by f;(- „vy. 5. Time will not legalize an encroachment upon a public highway. 6. The act of March 24th, 1859, (Nix. Nig. 751.) applies not to ancient highways, but to roads not opened, used, or worked within twenty years after being laid out. This was a motion to dissolve an injunction, made npon the bill and answer and the affidavits annexed. Mr. Pitney, in support of the motion. The bill impliedly admits that Elm street should be sixty-six feet wide. The courses of the lines of South and Elm streets, taken from complainant’s deed, show that those streets meet at an acute angle, making an obtuse angle of one hundred and fifteen degrees on complainant’s lot. Hence the measurement of sixty-seven and a half feet along South street was a diagonal measurement, and shows the street less than sixty-six feet wide* The northwest line of the street, as fixed by the bill, shows that the required width must come from the complainant’s lot, as we claim. The complainant is careful not to swear that the fence has stood in its present position more than thirty-seven years. The question of adverse use was settled in the case ¡of Cross v. Morristown, 3 C. P. Creen 305. See also Magyar of Jersey City v. Morris Canal and Banking Co., 1 Beas. 560-1, opinion of Whelpley, J. Hence, complainant’s case fails on the bill. If the fact of a diagonal measurement had appeared to the Chancellor, it is evident no injunction would have been granted. The answer shows a street or road laid out by surveyors in 1786. If proceedings of surveyors voidable, yet it is too late now to set up such defect. The complainant is bound by long 'acquiescence. The survey is an ancient record. The street has been-opened and used in accordance with it. It is recognized in the deed under which complainant claims title. The survey shows that Stites’ line corresponds in course with the line of actual use, excepting along complainant’s land. If there is any.mistake in Stites’ line, it is in favor of the complainant. The deed from James Wood to Albert Barnes shows that complainant’s fence encroaches on Elm street five feet and eleven inches — -just what we claim. Mr. Barnes’ affidavit is conclusive. We insist that the location of the street is sufficiently certain to dispense with appointment of commissioners, under section seven, supplement of 1866, to charter of Morristown. At any rate, commission is not necessary to show that complainant’s fence is an encroachment. It is useless to continue injunction until final hearing, as it is manifest the case cannot be changed. The fixing of thirty-seven years by the complainant, as the time that the fence has occupied its present position, shows that she knew of Mr. Barnes’ change; and affidavit of Norris shows warning and notice. The defendants should have costs. Mr. Vanatta, contra. The injuries threatened by the defendants, and complained of in the bill, viz. removing and destroying shade trees, shrubbery, and fences, and seizing land and appropriating it to public use, are irreparable mischiefs, and proper to be prevented by injunction. The intent to do the mischief is not denied, but admitted, and sought to be justified. The injunction was granted, and it rests upon the ground, that long possession of lands adjoining a street, and long ■usage of the street in conformity to that possession, are evidence of where the street is. Den d. Haring v. Van Houten, 2 Zab. 61. After so long a possession, accompanied by title, as is shown by the bill and admitted by the answer, especially ■where the possession was taken in good faith, and has been so held, as is the fact in this case, the party in possession should not be ousted, and the land wrested from her, until a paramount legal title to the loous in quo has been judicially established. And she is entitled to retain the possession until that is done. The defendants have no rights in, or power over, the premises in question, unless the grantors of the complainant, more than thirty-seven years ago, were guilty of a purpres-ture. Such a question (if this court will decide it at all) should not be decided on a motion to dissolve an injunction. To dissolve the injunction is practically to decide the whole case against her, and take her land from her at once, although it may be at the final hearing she will be able te show that the charge of purpresture made against her grantors is unfounded. The rightfulness of a possession so bona fide, and of such long duration as the complainant’s, should not be tried or decided upon ex parte affidavits. Besides that, if it should be established that the complainant’s fence does encroach upon the limits of the old road survey, the question would still remain, whether the encroachment is so injurious to the public as to require its abatement. 2 Watermans Eden on Injuno. 259, 260; Hex v. Lord G-rosvernor, 2 Starkie’s Nisi Prius 511. That question the court will hardly dispose of on a motion to dissolve an injunction. In such cases, the court will preserve the property in dispute until tins legal right is decided. 2 Waterman’s Eden on Injune. (3d ed.) 271-3, note 3. In this case, the court may order an issue to try the question whether complainant’s fence encroaches upon the highway; or the court, perhaps, may try the question of nuisance or no nuisance; but it will not try that question on a motion to dissolve an injunction, when the whole defence rests upon the lqcation of a line run in 1786, and when the possession for over thirty-seven years has been in contradic tion of the location of that line, as now made by the defendants. To dissolve the injunction on ex parte affidavits is, in effect, to allow the defendants to locate the line themselves, and to turn the complainant out of possession before her right is tried. In short, my point is this: the complainant is bona fide in possession of land by actual enclosure; it is included in her deed. Her possession has been of more than thirty-seven years’ duration. No one can, therefore, legally turn her out .of possession, on the pretext that her fence is inside of an old road survey, until after judgment against her right in a court of competent jurisdiction; and if any one attempts to turn her out before such judgment, in such manner that the eviction will work an irreparable injury, this court will restrain them by injunction. The line of the street is not so proved by the defendants, that the court can now say that the line insisted upon by the defendants is the true line. Not only are the line and monuments designated by defendants’ survey not in accordance with those established, but, on the contrary, every location and possession on the west side of Elm street, as appears by the map annexed to their answer, is a contradiction of the accuracy of that survey. It is admitted by the answer, that the complainant is occupying pursuant to the deed from James Wood to Albert Barnes, dated the 12th of March, 1829, and that she does not encroach upon the street as described in that deed. The description in that deed has been followed ever since in conveyances and possession — over thirty-eight years. It is to be assumed that Wood and Barnes understood the street to be according to that description. Their understanding at that time, of where the Street lines were, was much more likly to be correct than any conclusion Mr. Stites may now arrive at. James Wood was cotemporary with Elm street. He owned more land on the street than any one person. That deed is his testimony as to where the street was. The affidavit of Mr. Barnes shows that, in 1829, the line of the street was understood and believed to be just where the complainant claims it to be, and he located his fence accordingly. The well settled principle is, that practical location is evidence of a mistake iu the description. Opdyke v. Stephens, 4 Butcher 89, 90. This principle, where surveys have boon made by the corn-pass, is indispensable and invaluable. Without it, the utmost confusion and mischief would ensue. Without being guided and controlled by established, recognized monuments, or recognized linos of occupation, no line of any considerable length, run by the compass, can be accurately ascertained, even one day after it is run. The diurnal variation of the needle, and the variation produced by over-changing local causes, make the compass incapable of marking a long line twice iu the same place. The diurnal variation of the needle, amounting often to three-fourths of a degree in a day, in a line of twenty-four chains, would amount to over seven feet. Hence there is not one chance in one thousand that Stites has found the line run in 1786. Mr. Barnes’ affidavit is, that he placed his fence to the eastward of what was then understood to be the easterly line of Elm street. IIis deed so said; and Matthew (x. Lindsley, a very old man if he were now living, and a cotemporary of Elm street, so told Mr. Barnes. It is improbable that Lindsley advised his pastor to encroach upon the highway. If Barnes did so encroach, it is improbable that everybody, for thirty-six ye.ars after Mr. Barnes sold the property and left Morristown, would acquiesce in an encroachment. Could Mr. Barnes have been cross-examined, it would have been shown that lie placed his fence where it was thou understood the line of Elm street was. Moreover, it would have been shown that, for many years before he built his fence, there was no fence at all on the South street side of his lot. The affidavit of John Orowell shows that, from 1818 to 1829, and until Mr. Barnes put one up, there was no fence at all on the South street side of the complainant’s lot. To the same effect is the affidavit of Edwin L. Lounsbury. A perusal of these two affidavits cannot fail to convince the court that it should not, by its judgment, fix that street line upon ex parte affidavits. By Mr. Barnes’ affidavit, it appears that he terminated his fence on Elm street in a line with the fence on the Oampfield lot. Yet that fence, where it joined to Mr. Barnes’ fence, by Stites’ survey, stood over two and one half feet in the street. Again: Stites refers, and the answer does, to Nathan Ford’s deed to James Rogers, in 1804. And yet Stites’ line is two links different from the street line of that deed. His survey is wrong, because it conflicts with the practical location at every point. By Stites’ affidavit, it will be seen that he fixed the beginning of Elm street by mere assumption. He says he found the southeasterly corner of Frederick King’s lot by running over a well, &c. Then he went along Morris street northwesterly, two, chains and twenty-eight links. He says, that at the end of two chains and twenty-eight links, he “ assumed to be the southwest corner of the first lot,” &c. He does not swear that there is any corner at the end of that line; nor is there, in fact. Hence he “ assumed ” a corner, and upon that builds his whole survey. As to, the other and principal monument, namely, the division line between Nathan Ford and Ohilion Ford, and Nathan Ford and David Ford, (which division line was the centre of Elm street,) Stites does not pretend to say that he knows where it is, nor what it was. Nor does he pretend that he found that line. Although the centre line of the road survey is south 28° 80' west, yet that course is subordinated to the partition between the Fords. It is a case in which the road must be located by the monument, and not by the oourse. His whole survey is based upon an erroneous principle, and upon asr sumptions. The road was tied to a monument. He has run it by the course, and disregarded all monuments, except such as he assumed. Again; the map of Elm street, appended to the answer, shows, that at the mouth of Elm street the defendants have one hundred and eighteen feet for road purposes; fifty-five foot seven inches of that they devote to a useless park, and that hay been extended to the eastward lately. The plaintiff’s grantor purchased, in common with others, that ground, and devoted it to street purposes, and the defendants have accepted it for that purpose. The buying of the land to extend Elm street westward, implied an understanding that it should not bo extended eastward. Elaving accepted that gift on those conditions, and now having it, it is inequitable for the defendants to spread the road in the Chester lot, now complainant’s. When Mr. Chester was solicited to contribute to that purchase, he was shown a map, showing how the ground was to be used, and he paid his money upon the faith of that arrangement being carried out. By that map, there was to be a street thirty-three feet wide, between Mr. Chester’s lot and the park; a street of like width between Mr. Mnchmore’s (now Mrs. Turner’s) lot; and the residue, leaving fifty feet front on South street, was to be put into a park. The understanding with Mr. Chester was, that the park on South street should be fifty feet. Stites’ map, annexed to the answer, shows that the park on South street is fifty-five feet and seven inches. They say Mrs. Tainter’s fence encroached five feet ten inches. Brookfield’s map, put alongside the map appended to the answer, shows that the defendants’ fence encroaches five foot seven inches. Instead of admitting that Elm street is sixty-six feet wide, the iusistment of the bill is, that the street as actually used, are its proper and rightful limits. The fact that Elm street does not intersect South street at right angles abundantly appears by the bill. The bill expressly states that the measurement of the mouth of Elm street at South street, was on the easterly side of South street. The affidavit of Mr. Stone, appended to the bill, is to the same effect. Hence, it appears that it is not true, as alleged in defendants’ points, that if the fact of diagonal measurement had appeared to the Chancellor, the injunction would not have been granted. That fact did appear in every way possible. The only legal authority for laying out such a road in 1786 was the act of March 11th, 1774. Allinson,p. 387, § 3. Scarcely a single one of the requirements of that act was complied with. Its requirements were— 1. That not less than ten freeholders might apply, in writing, to the two surveyors of the town where the road was proposed to be laid, &c. By the return of the surveyors, nor in any other way, it does not appear that any such application was ever made to the surveyors. 2. That two of the applying persons should sign and fix up advertisements in three of the most public places of the township where the said road was proposed to be laid. It does not appear by the return of the surveyors, nor in any other way, that any such, or indeed any kind of notice was given. 3. The return does not show, nor does it appear, that the other requirements of the act were complied with, except that the time for opening it is named. The return fails to show any power, authority, or jurisdiction in the surveyors. Being a special statutory authority, it cannot be presumed. Hence the survey is a nullity. If good at all, it is only good so far as executed. It will not authorize the public to go beyond what they have actually used. That return per se, does not legally condemn any land to public use. If the public have rights, they must rest upon dedication and uso, and not upon the survey and return, because both were without authority of law. Outside of the occupied lines, the defendants can take nothing, except by a legal condemnation of tho land to public use. They show no such condemnation. Hence they have no right, outside of what has been used for a street within twenty years last past. Hex v. Inhabitants of Audley, 2 Balk. 526; Hex v. Crolce, Cowper 26; Hex v. Manning, 1 Burr. 371; .Rex v. Liverpool, 4 Burr. 2244; N. J, R. and T. Co. v. Buy dam, 2 Harr. 30. The return of the surveyors set out in the answer is void, because it does not show upon its face, jurisdiction in tho surveyors. The defendants are out of possession. They assert title to the premises in dispute. The onus probandi is on them. They must prove a legal title. Such a return may be admissible as evidence on a question of boundary between two adjoining proprietors. 2 Zab. 61. But to divert the title of the land owner who is in possession, it is not sufficient. Suppose they offered a sheriff’s deed, in which no execution was shown, could they recover upon such a deed ?\",\n",

Error to the District Court of Hamilton county. This is a petition in error, to reverse the judgment of the 'District Court of Hamilton county. From the pleadings .and testimony, it appears that Dr. Smith, ancestor of plaintiff owned a tract of land, about one hundred and seventy-five acres, in the northwest quarter of Millcreek township, Hamilton county, having acquired the title in 1821. The matter in controversy in this suit is about the southern line of this tract. The Smith property, as well as that south •of it, now belonging to McKay, came through Stephen Burroughs, and the concluding portion of the deed from Burroughs to Smith is this : “ Containing one hundred and .•seventy-five acres, strict measure, and in case of deficiency -or surplus, the quantity to be adjusted at the south end of ■the above described tract.” The line between Smith and McKay had been marked by a fence, put up by one Bates, through whom McKay claims. Bates erected this fence in .June, 1848. It remained there about twenty years, and until the day after the presidential election of 1868, a period of not quite twenty-one years. Upon the day named, the day after the ’presidential election of 1868, the •Smiths, claiming that this fence was some fifteen rods north of what was the true line between the parties, took it down, and reset it upon what they assert to be the true line, namely, fifteen rods south of its former location. Learning that McKay was about to tear down the fence, as newly established, the Smiths filed their petition in this case, to enjoin defendant from interfering with it. McKay’s answer claims by right of possession for over forty years, alleging that the north boundary, which is the subject of dispute, had been marked by a blazed line, and had been agreed upon as a division line. He therefore asks, by way of cross-petition, that the Smiths be dispossessed of the ground south of the said line, and that the same be-restored to defendant, and that plaintiff be required to restore the fence, etc. After trial in the common pleas an appeal was taken to the district court, where, upon hearing, judgment was rendered that plaintiff surrender to defexxdant the tract of land in dispute; that he remove the fence, and x’estore it to its oxñginal line whence it had been taken. Plaintiff took exceptions to this judgment. . A mption for new trial being overruled, a bill of exceptions, containing all the evidence, was taken, and a petitioxx in exTor filed in the supreme court. Long, Kramer & Kramer, for plaintiff in error, claimed that as twenty-one years had not run from the time the fence was erected uxxtil the mistake was discovered and corrected by the x’emoval of the fence to the true line, the-statute of limitations did not work an estoppel. That in order to acquire title under an occupancy of twenty-one-years, there must be actual occupancy, and notorious, continuous, and exclusive possession of the land. McAfferty v. Conover, 7 Ohio St. 99; Lane v. King, 13 Ohio St. 46; Abrams v. Wiley, 6 Ohio, 164; Walker v. Devlin, 2 Ohio St. 593; Yetzer v. Thoman, 17 Ohio St. 130; MeNeely v. Lang-an, 22 Ohio St. 32. That title can not be acquired,' under the statute of limitations, to land uninclosed, unoccupied, unimpx’oved, and in its wild and natural condition. And this is more especially so when it appears that the adjoining proprietors- of wild lands, in having formed an idea of the location of the division line between them of such lands, were mutually mistaken as to its proper location.

Hoadly, Johnson & Colston, for defendant in error, claimed the real question to be whether, when a man takes possession of an entire tract of land, partly cleared and inclosed, the residue being woodland, marked and defined on the ground by lines known to and acquiesced in by the adjoining proprietor, he does not hold adversely to, and exclusively of that other, as well the woodland as the cleared land, and cited Yetzer v.

EJECTMENT: Adverse Possession: Theory Submitted by Instructions: Against Defendant’s Objection. Where plaintiff claimed that defendant’s claim of ownership based upon his adverse possession for more than ten years, was conditional upon and subject to the ascertainment of the true line between their adjoining lots, and the defendant asked a peremptory instruction, which the court should have given under the evidence, unless there was evidence that defendant’s claim of title by use and occupancy was conditional upon the subsequent ascertainment of title, and defendant objected to an instruction submitting that issue, and the court gave instructions for plaintiff upon that theory, defendant had a right to meet that issue, and is not chargeable with having induced the error, and the court on appeal will still decide whether or not that issue should have been submitted, notwithstanding defendant, after his peremptory instruction was refused and his objection to submitting that issue was overruled, asked a proper instruction on the subject. 2. -: -: True Line. If defendant entered upon the lot and located the fence and barn'by mistake and in ignorance of the location of the true boundary line, yet if he had no intention of taking what did not belong to him, the fact that he may have inclosed a larger area than his deed called for would not destroy the adverse character of his possession, if his intention was to elhim and hold all that the fence inclosed. But if he located the fence on what he supposed was the true line and intended to claim only to the true line whenever and wherever it might be located, his possession was not adverse. 3. -: -: -: Facts Showing Intention. Defendant bought lots 1 and 2 fourteen years before the suit was brought and had occupied them ever since. When he took possession there was a fence and barn where they were at the trial, the fence inclosing a strip of Jot 3 from two and one-half feet wide at one end to four feet at the other, and the harn projecting that much over the line into lot 3, and the strip had been cultivated. More than ten years before suit was brought defendant had been requested by the owner of lot 3 to move his fence back, and refused and told the owner he claimed everything within the inclosure as his own, and at the trial he testified that he had always so claimed. His contract of purchase called for lots 1 and 2, and he testified that he bought the inclosure, never had the lots surveyed, never measured it, and did not know the fence was not on the true line. Beld, that it being admitted the defendant had been in actual possession for more than ten years, the court should have given a peremptory instruction for him.

Where one is indicted for obstructing a long-used public highway, by the erection of a private wall upon what he claims to be his property line, the question as to his defence is, not whether his wall is within the lines of the highway as originally laid out, reported and confirmed, but whether it is within its lines as maintained by the supervisors and used by the public. Before Paxson, C. J., Green, Clark, Williams, Mc-Collum and Mitchell, JJ. No. 21 July Term 1889, Sup. Ct.; court below, number and term not given. On January 30, 1889, the grand jury returned as a true bill an indictment charging Hoopes Marshall with unlawfully obstructing a public highway. Issue. At the trial on January 31,1889, it was shown, in substance, that one George Ashbridge, by his will made on March 30, 1773, gave two roods of land for a public highway, to be laid out north of what at the date of the alleged obstruction was the land of the defendant; that in 1849, for some reason, a proceeding was instituted in the Quarter Sessions by which a public highway was laid out and confirmed by the court to be opened thirty-three feet wide, with its south line upon the north line of the said land; that the road was afterwards opened by the supervisors and traveled by the public until the date of this trial; that there was a fence on the north side of it which had been there, at the time of the trial, for twenty-five years, but there was evidence that it was only about fifteen feet from the centre of the roadway as used by the traveling public; that there was no fence on the south side of the road, until a short time before the prosecution was begun, when the defendant, having had a survey of his land made and his north line ascertained, caused a wall to be erected a few inches within his line, as he claimed it, which left for a roadway, as claimed by the commonwealth, a width of but little over sixteen feet from the wall to the ditch on the north side of the road. Hence this case. The defendant contended, as stated in his History of the Case, “ that the road having been willed, laid out and opened thirty-three feet north from his line, it would remain so, until changed under proceedings for that purpose in court.” At the close of the testimony, the court, Waddell, P. J., charged the jury: We say to you that under the circumstances of this case and under the evidence, these supervisors must take that road as they find it, and they have no power to change its location. [If, in their opinion, it was not thirty-three feet wide, then they had the power to widen it, but in thus widening it they must ascertain as well as they can the centre of the present roadbed and widen it from that centre line sixteen and one half feet on each side.] 5 As we have suggested before, in the course of the trial, if that took down Mr. Cloud’s fence, it must come down; it it took down anybody else’s fence, it must come down. But they cannot take the whole width off Mr. Cloud any more than they can take the whole width off Mr. Marshall. Now you see gentlemen, just how far, in the estimation of the court, the supervisors of that township had power. If we are wrong, then there is an opportunity to correct us. Now what are the circumstances here ? Is there, from the testimony, or from the observation which you have had the opportunity of enjoying, a well defined, beaten track for this road ? [As I said to you, if there was a fence upon the south side, there could be no question whatever, but the absence of that fence on that side makes it necessary for you to determine the limit of the roadbed upon that side of the road.] 6 Is there a well defined roadbed there ? Does the testimony in the case, or the observation which 3mu have made, satisfy your minds that the roadbed as used and occupied and enjoyed by the public for years is defined on the ground ? I do not mean by that, gentlemen, are there tracks there where wagons have traveled,, but is there a roadbed defined, such as is customary and usual in country roads ? If it is, then that is the roadbed of this road, without regard to Mr. Ashbridge’s will, or without regard to the laying out by the former jury..... The defendant has asked me to charge you upon some points which he has submitted for my consideration, involving, as he understands it, the law in the case. 1. That the evidence adduced on the part of the defendant clearly shows that the road in question was laid out and opened thirty-three feet wide north of the defendant’s line, and upon ground dedicated to the public by the will of George Ashbridge and accepted as such by the township ; the supervisors cannot now claim more ground than thirty-three feet, and the defendant must be acquitted. Answer: I cannot affirm that point in its entirety ; I cannot say that under the circumstances of this case the defendant must be acquitted. I must therefore disaffirm that point, while there are some principles in it that I would consider were law.1 2. That the road in question was laid out and opened on the ground willed by George Ashbridge for a public road, thirty-three feet wide north of the wall built by the defendant, and, having once been laid out and opened, cannot be altered except by a new and original proceeding according to the road law. Answer: That principle I affirm; there is no question at all about that. 3. That if the jury believe that Hoopes Marshall occupied no part of the public road laid out and opened on the ground willed by George Ashbridge for a public road, the defendant is not guilty of the offence with which he is charged and shall be acquitted. Answer: That point is disaffirmed.8 4. That there is no evidence in this case for the jury to find that the ground upon which the stone wall was built was ever taken and occupied by the public for a highway according to law. Answer: That point is disaffirmed.3 5. That under all the evidence in this case the court should direct the jury to acquit the defendant. Answer: I cannot do that. I must say to you that it is a question of fact for your consideration, in connection with the principles of law as I have endeavored to explain them to you.4 —The jury returned a verdict that the defendant was guilty, etc. A rule for a new trial having been discharged, judgment was passed, when the defendant took this appeal, assigning for error: 1-4.

If the judgment entered on the verdict of a jury in a special proceeding to obtain the right of way for railroad purposes be defective in matters of form, the proper course is not to apply to this court for a writ of certiorari, but to the court in which it is entitled, for the correction of the record or vacation of the erroneous judgment. An appeal taken by the railroad company from an award of commissioners under Gen. Stat., oh. 34, title I, s. 25, brings before the district court the propriety of an increase, as well as a decrease of the damages, awarded. The road was built and in operation in the fall of 1865, over the land in question with respondent’s consent, “the question of damages for the right of way to be adjusted after the road was in operation.” Meld, that, this means the question as to how much the land owner should receive in compensation for the easement the railroad company might acquire through such a special proceeding, and\\'that the understanding of the parties must be taken to have been that such question should be adjusted, in default of purchase or voluntary gift, by such a proceeding. The respondent being called as a witness in his own behalf was asked: “What was the farm worth at the time of the commencement of these proceedings in the fall of 1870, without the railroad being upon the farm, and what was its value at that time with the railroad upon the farm? ” Meld, not to be incorrect because not confined to the time when the railroad was completed, and that although the date of the award would have been proper, yet as the time fixed in the question was, to the extent of the difference between it and that of the award, in the petitioner’s favor, it cannot complain thereof. Simmons vs. Chicago and St. P. By., 18 Minn. 184, followed, as to the propriety of the question without regard to the particular date. The witness testified that his house on the land was not built .for an hotel, that it was built the year after the road was located and graded through the landj and that the depreciation in its value by the road was one fourth of its value. Meld, that it was irrelevant and immaterial to inquire on cross-examination whether it was not built for an hotel, instead of a farm house, and because of the location of the railroad there to furnish hotel accomodations for customers which he supposed a depot at that point would bring to the house; as also to inquire whether the depreciation testified to in the value of the house, and also of the farm, was not mainly caused by the omission to locate a depot on the farm. While it is improper on cross-examination to assume facts to have been proved which have not been; as, nevertheless, error must be shown affirmatively, if the case, as settled, does not purport to contain all the evidence, no benefit can be had in this court of an exception taken at the ’trial to the ruling of the court below in allowing a question to be answered against an objection that it assumed facts not proved. Part of the respondent’s land lay north, and the rest, being an eighty acre tract, lay south of a public road, running on the line between it and the rest. Respondent testified that he bought said eighty acre .tract in 1858, of K; that K occupied it as a separate farm and had a farm house on it; that the road was there when he bought it; that it was tillable and had been cultivated by a tenant the last two years. The jury were instructed that for the purpose of assessing the respondent’s damages, his farm must be considered as .a unit, but tv hat such unit includes the jury must determine; that the petitioner contended that said eighty acres was a separate parcel of land, and not\"within the farm, and not to be considered in estimating the damages; that this was a question for them; if it was a part of -the farm, they might consider the effect of the road upon respondent’s convenience and safety in cultivating it from his dwelling in connection with his other land constituting his farm, otherwise not. Held, not to be error. Before taking these proceedings the company, at respondent’s request, had made a certain under-crossing for his accommodation. The provision of oh. 1, Special Laws 1864, sub. ch. 2, s. 2, that the company shall construct and maintain all proper and necessary farm crossings over the line of said road, means crossings from one side to the other of the railroad track, whether by passing over or under it. If, therefore, such an under-crossing, as above, in that place was proper and necessary, the jury were bound to assess the damages on the theory that it would be forever maintained. But the fact that it was built at respondent’s request,.and while the company was .using his land under the agreement aforesaid as to the adjustment of damages, would not estop him from showing that it was not thus proper and necessary; nor is it evidence tending to prove that it was necessary, nor to prove any agreement by the petitioner to maintain it forever. Whether in any case an under-crossing for cattle is, or not, necessary, is, at least, not one purely of law. The railroad company duly instituted proceedings in the district court for Scott county, .to obtain\\' the right of way over the land of Richard G. Murphy, and commissioners were duly appointed, and their report was made andfiled. Murphy and the company each appealed to the district court, and both appeals were tried together resulting in a verdict in favor of Murphy for a sum greater than that awarded by the commissioners. Judgment was entered upon the verdict, and the company appealed to the supreme court. The appeal was argued and submitted at the October term, 1872, and was subsequently dismissed. Tbe case is now in this court upon the petition of the company for a writ of certiorari to said district court, upon which an order to show cause why such writ should not be granted was issued and returned duly served. Upon the return of the order to show cause the case was submitted by both parties upon the papers used at the said October term. In all other respects the case is fully stated in the opinion.

       "  'case_summary': 'RYDALCH v. ANDERSON. No. 2054. Decided January 6, 1910 (107 Pac. 25). 1. Adverse Possession — Requisites—Payment op Taxes. Where land had been occupied under a claim of right for about twenty-four years, so as to acquire title under Comp. Laws 1876, secs. 1097-1104, requiring seven years’ adverse possession to acquire title, when Comp. Laws 1888, secs. 3137, effective in 1888, was enacted, making payment of taxes essential to the acquisition of title by the adverse possession, title by adverse possession was complete without the payment of taxes, either during the adverse holding or thereafter. (Page 106.) 2. Boundaries — Estoppel by Acquiescence — Persons Estopped— Heirs. An heir would be estopped by his ancestor’s acquiescence in an agreement with an adjoining landowner as to their boundaries, if the ancestor himself would be estopped. (Page 109.) 3. Boundaries — Estoppel by Acquiescence — Efpect op Subsequent Acts op Parties. The predecessors of defendant and plaintiff located land on sections 23 and 26, respectively, before it was surveyed and the section line run, and in 1865 they agreed upon a triangular line as the boundary, and erected a fence on the line. Thereafter the land was surveyed and the government section line run so as to cut through the triangular line, but as to the part of the lapd in controversy, the line as originally established and fenced was recognized and acquiesced in as the true line from the time it was established to 1905. Held, that defendant was estopped from claiming title to the tract in controversy within the triangular line fenced in 1865 to the extent that the parties had continued to treat it as the boundary line, and that they thereafter abandoned in part the original line and accepted the section line as the bound- „ ary for a part of the distance on either side of the tract in controversy, or that defendant’s deeds from his predecessor did not refer to any land in section 26, was immaterial. (Page 110.) 4. Boundaries — Estoppel by Acquiescence. Whether one is estopped from claiming land beyond an agreed boundary acquiesced in by him must be decided largely upon the particular facts of the case, and no absolute rule can be applied to every case. (Page 113.) 5. New Trial — Newly Discovered Evidence — Evidence on Collateral Matters. In an • action to quiet title to land, in which defendant claimed to a certain fence, fixed as the boundary by the parties’ predecessors, defendant testified that before he purchased from the heirs of his predecessor they stated that their land was bounded by the fence. Plaintiff filed with his motion for a new trial an affidavit of one of such heirs, to the effect that when defendant purchased from the heirs, affiant told him that the fence was not the true boundary, and they would sell only what they owned. Held that, even if the statement contained in the affidavit was newly discovered evidence, it was not such as to require a new trial, as its only effect was to contradict defendant’s testimony on a collateral matter. (Page 114.) 6. New Trial — Newly Discovered Evidence — Probable Epeect. Where alleged newly discovered evidence for which plaintiff sought a new trial would merely affect defendant’s credibility as a witness, and would not change the result even if defendant’s testimony on the question to which the newly discovered evidence related was eliminated, it was not ground for requiring a new trial. (Page 115.) 7. New Trial — Misconduct op Parties. In an action to quiet title, in which defendant claimed to a certain fence alleged to have been fixed and acquiesced in as the boundary by the parties’ predecessors, defendant served notice on plaintiff for the taking of a nonresident’s deposition, but did not afterwards have it taken, and plaintiff produced the affidavit of such person in support of his motion for new trial, stating that he told defendant when the latter purchased from him that the fence was not the true boundary line between his and plaintiff’s land. Meld that, in absence of a further showing by the record, defendant’s failure to take the deposition of such witness after serving notice, and to inform plaintiff’s counsel thereof, would not authorize a new trial on the ground of miseonduet. (Page 115.) 8. Judgment — Conformity to Issues. Where, in an action to quiet title, in which defendant claimed that a certain fence was the boundary, the pleadings and evidence did not raise the question as to defendant’s right to have plaintiff erect a fence upon the boundary line to which defendant claimed, the decree for defendant improperly required plaintiff to erect such fence.

Obstruction of Way — Mandatory Injunction — Final Decree — Report — Waiver — Estoppel. It is for the court, in the exercise of a sound discretion, to determine whether a permanent obstruction in the use of an easement entitles the aggrieved party to a restoration of the former situation, and a mandatory injunction will not he issued when it will operate inequitably and oppressively, nor when there has been unreasonable delay by the party seeking it in the enforcement of his rights, nor when the injury complained of is not serious or substantial, and may be readily compensated in damages; while to restore things as they were before the acts complained of would subject the other party to great inconvenience and loss. It is doubtful whether a right to pass, not in a particular line, but everywhere over the premises over which the right is claimed, may be acquired by prescription as a right of way. On the issue whether the plaintiff had acquired a right to use as a passageway the entire area of certain premises before the defendant purchased the same, where it appeared that the parties had substituted another way therefor, and had continued to use the substituted way for many years without objection, it was held that equity would not interfere to compel the defendant to remove a permanent building erected by him on the premises. Where, on a bill in equity for a mandatory injunction for the removal of an obstruction from a way, the presiding justice, as the parties could not agree, appointed, without affording them a hearing, a commission to determine the location and the width of the way, the parties being informed thereof, but making no objection, it was held to be too late for the plaintiff to make objections after the commissioners’ report had been made, and a final decree had been entered. Two BILLS IN equity, filed in the Superior Court in January, 1889, to enjoin the defendant from interfering with a way in the city of Worcester, and to compel him to remove a building and fences therefrom. Hearing before Aldriph, J., who, after the entry of a final decree in each suit, reported the cases for the determination of this court, and directed a stay of further proceedings until they should be determined. The material parts of the reports are as follows. The plaintiffs were the owners of real estate abutting on Layard Place, so called, in the city of Worcester, a way running easterly from Main Street about one hundred feet, of varying width, averaging about nine and one half feet, and then turning and running northerly by the premises of the plaintiffs with a width of twenty feet. The situation of the premises is shown on a plan given on the next page. In 1834, the land over which the way ran, and on both sides thereof, was owned by one Davis; and the land on the north side of Layard Place, at the corner of Main Street, was occupied by a building known as the Slater Block, extending about thirty-six feet in depth from Main Street, and forming to that extent the northern boundary of the way. Beyond the southeast corner of the Slater Block the north line of the passageway was not marked or defined by any structure, but at that time and for more than twenty years prior thereto, Starkie, as tenant, and all other persons who used the way, had travelled over the open space which extended eastward from the rear of the Slater Block in a northeasterly direction around the' corner of the Slater Block to a dye-house occupied by Starkie. On the 1st of October, 1872, Davis was the owner of the Slater Block and the open space in the rear thereof, as above described, and on that day he conveyed to the plaintiff Starkie certain other real estate abutting upon Layard Place, together with a right of way in said passage to and from Main Street, as said way then existed. The predecessors in title of the plaintiff Green derived their right by a conveyance from Davis in 1834, describing a tract of land on the east side of Main Street, and adding: “ Also I give and grant unto the grantees, their heirs and assigns, a right of passageway entering in at the south end of the store now occupied by Elijah A. Brigham [which was the south store in the Slater Block] and passing in the rear of my buildings, between my store and barn, to the rear of their store as it now is, and to the rear of it as it shall be extended in depth, so as to be sixty feet deep, and it is further agreed by the parties to this deed, in case the grantor, his heirs or assigns, should erect new buildings on Main Street, the passageway might be .removed further east. ... It is understood that the above passageway is to be a free and open- passageway, convenient for teams to pass and repass to and from the rear of the grantee’s store as the store now is, or as it may hereafter be, unless the depth of said store exceed sixty feet.” Teams in going to and from the premises of the plaintiff Green were accustomed, without objection from the owner of the area in the rear of the Slater Block, to pass over any part of it, turning northerly after passing the southeast corner of the Slater Block, instead of keeping on in a more easterly course and turning northerly within the limits of the twenty-foot passageway. In 1873, Davis conveyed to one Ames the lot containing the Slater Block, bounding it upon the south and east by Layard Place ; and in October, 1877, Ames conveyed the southern portion of this lot to the defendant. In the summer of 1875 Ames built a picket fence in the rear of the Slater Block, which stood until after the deed to the defendant, but there was no evidence that the fence was built for the purpose of indicating or defining the north line of the passageway, unless the existence of the fence constitute such evidence. In 1878 the defendant removed the Slater Block and the fence, and erected the building now standing on the north side of Layard Place. While he was engaged in that work, the wife of the plaintiff Starkie, who was authorized to represent him, went to the defendant as soon as the work had progressed enough to show where the walls were to be, and told him that he had gone over the passage; to which the defendant replied that his deeds were all right; whereupon the plaintiff Starkie’s wife said that her husband’s deeds were before his, and that her husband understood that he had nearly ten feet of passageway. The defendant’s new building extended east from Main Street 80.2 feet, leaving the passageway between it and the building on the south side of Layard Place of a uniform width of nine feet and four inches. The area between the east end of Richmond’s new building and the twenty-foot passageway was left open from the completion of .the building in 1878 until 1887, during which time teams passed and repassed over the open area around the southeast corner of the building to and from the premises of the respective plaintiffs. In 1887 the defendant built a fence extending from the southeast corner of his building 19.9 feet easterly on the same line, and then turning at a right angle and running northerly and enclosing said open area. In 1887, prior to.the erection of the fence, the plaintiff Green and the wife of the plaintiff Starkie had several interviews with the defendant in reference to paving the passageway from Main Street, and also the area in the rear of and up to the defendant’s new building, which was done, the expense thereof being shared by the plaintiffs, the defendant, and others who had rights in the passageway. This fence was erected by the defendant in consequence of a controversy between him and Mrs. Starkie as to the condition in which the area forming the back yard of the new building was kept, and it enclosed part of the paved surface. While the defendant was erecting his building in 1878, the plaintiff Green was abroad, and did not know of it until his return' after its completion. He did not know that the way had been narrowed till some years afterward, although he might at any time have ascertained it by measurement. Except for the conversation above referred to between the defendant and Mrs. Starkie, at the time when the defendant’s building was in process of erection, neither of the plaintiffs took any steps toward the removal of the defendant’s building or fence, or to recover damages for interference with the way, until the commencement of these, suits, nor was any further complaint made by either plaintiff until after the building of the fence in 1887. The presiding justice found that the defendant’s new building stands partly on land over which teams were accustomed to pass in the rear of the Slater Block ; and that the defendant by his building near the line of Main Street had narrowed the passage-way thirty-seven hundredths of a foot, and at the actual line of Main Street over forty-six hundredths of a foot; and that he had widened it two tenths of a foot where the southeast corner of the Slater Block stood. He refused, however, to order the removal of the building, for the following reasons. First, that the defendant had the right to occupy his rear lot with a per manenfc building, leaving a passageway convenient for teams to pass and repass to and from the premises of the plaintiff Green, and leaving a passageway for teams to pass and repass to and from the premises of the plaintiff Starkie, substantially and for all practical purposes such as was conveyed to Starkie by Davis by his deed of 1872, as he found would be done when a post and fences and other obstructions were removed, as ordered in the final decrees heretofore filed in these cases. Secondly, because the plaintiffs, long after they knew in what condition the defendant’s building left the passage, requested the defendant to unite with them and others in causing the passageway to be concreted and paved, as it then was, which the defendant did, as hereinbefore stated. Thirdly, because of the long acquiescence of the plaintiffs in the way as it was after the said new building was erected, taking no steps for its removal, until the commencement of these suits, and making no complaint until after the building of said fence in 1887. Since the filing of the final decrees, the defendant has removed the fence and post, and all other obstructions to the way, in conformity with the decrees, so that the passageway is now in width and form substantially as it was during the nine years from 1878 to 1887. After the hearing and before the entry of the final decrees, the presiding justice called the counsel together, the plaintiff Green being also present, and informed them orally that he had determined that the defendant had encroached upon the north side of the way by his building and fence, and that, if the parties found, on conferring together, they could not come to an agreement in the matter, he should employ a surveyor, and with his aid mark on the surface of the earth the limits of the way, so as to establish them for all time. Later, having been informed that the parties could not agree, he appointed a commission of three experienced men, one of whom was a civil engineer and surveyor, “ to determine the location of, and the width for, a convenient passageway for teams, over a passageway called Layard Place, leading easterly from Main Street in Worcester.” This commission was selected by the presiding justice without a hearing being given on the question of its constitution or appointment, but the parties were informed of its appointment, and the plaintiff Green was personally told by him that the commissioners would meet at the way at an hour named, and mark out the way, and Green went to the place at that hour. There were but two of the commissioners present, and they were inspecting the way. At this same meeting a son of the plaintiff Starkie was present. There was no evidence, however, that he was authorized to act as his representative. Starkie did not see the commissioners afterwards, nor was he notified of nor did he share in their later inspections of the premises, or in their deliberations, nor know of their conclusions, or the terms of their appointment, except, as above stated, that they would meet and mark out the way, until their report was filed and the decrees in the cases entered. Since the final decrees were filed, the plaintiff Green has informed the presiding justice that he did not express to the commission his wishes in relation to the location of the way. Green did not see them afterwards, nor was he notified of nor did he share in their later inspections of the premises, or in their deliberations, nor know of their conclusions, or the terms of their appointment, except, as above stated, that they would meet and mark out the way, until their report was filed and the decrees in the cases entered. The plaintiffs made no objection to the appointment of said commission until after the filing of the final decree in each case. The final decrees were based upon the evidence introduced at the hearing, upon the view of the premises taken by the court, as aforesaid, and upon the report of said commissioners. F. P. Goulding R.

Taxation — Action to Recover Land Sold for Taxes — Limitation under Washington Statute. Code Wash. 1881, § 2939, limiting the time for bringing suits to recover lands sold for taxes to three years, was a part of Act Dec. 1, 1881, “to provide for the assessment and collection of county and territorial revenue,” and was repealed by Act March IS, 1893, p. 385, c. 124, § 137, which expressly repeals “all acts and parts of acts heretofore enacted by the Legislature of the territory or state of Washington providing for the assessment and collection of taxes in this state.” 2. Same — Pleading—Admissions in Bill. In a bill to set aside a tax title, which sets out the proceedings for selling the property, and alleges their invalidity, a statement that a deed was issued, “whereby and by the terms of which said county treasurer granted and conveyed” the property to the grantee, cannot be construed as an admission that the title passed by such deed. 3. Same — Right to Maintain. In a suit under Ballinger’s Ann. Codes & St. Wash. § 5521 (Pierce’s Code, § 1156), by one in possession of lands, to set aside a tax title thereon, plaintiff is not required to plead title in himself, nor to prove it even if alleged. 4. Trespass — Title to Support Action — Tax Title — Constructive Possession by Purchaser. An invalid tax deed does not give the holder constructive possession of fhe property, so as to render another who enters upon and takes actual possession of it a trespasser, nor does the continued payment of taxes thereon by the holder of such deed. 5. Quieting Title — Suit under Washington Statute — Possession to Support. Under Ballinger’s Ann. Codes & St. Wash. § 5521 (Pierce’s Code, § 1156), which authorizes any one in possession of real property to maintain a suit to determine an adverse claim thereto, it is immaterial that possession was taken for the purpose of instituting the suit, if it was not tortious or in violation of the prior possession of another. 6.

A dam built across an arm of the sea, into wliicli a fresh water creek empties, to exclude the salt water for the purpose of creating a fresh water pond, upon which to cultivate and harvest ice for the market, without direct authority of the legislature or the delegated action of harbor commissioners, if the case falls within their jurisdiction, is in the same sense a public nuisance as it would be to build a solid wall across a road or street. Without such authority such a dam never acquires the right to exist by prescription. Where, by the terms of a lease, the lessor agreed to keep up such a dam during a certain portion of the year, in consideration of the covenants of the lease, it was held to be an illegal contract. No rule precludes either parly from showing the illegality of a lease void from public policy. A deed of a tide-mill privilege, mill dam, wharf privilege and the right to flow the creek and adjoining lands to high water mark, “and all the rights and highways connected with and belonging to said mill privilege,” gives the grantee no right to ice cutting, nor title to the ice formed upon a fresh water pond raised by changing the dam so as to exclude the salt water. ON REPORT. The case is stated in the opinion. The law court was to render such judgment as law and justice require. Webb and Haskell, for the plaintiff. These defendants do not claim any right to prevent the plaintiff from utilizing his mill property as an ice field in the winter season, why then should they he upheld in willfully appropriating to their own use the product of the plaintiff’s property ? The use of the mill is lost to the plaintiff in order that he may harvest ice from his mill pond. The controversy here is not whether the plaintiff has unlawfully • shut out tide water, but whether, having done so and made an ice pond, the defendants who neither do nor can lawfully object,. are justified in trespassing upon bis possession and carrying away his ice. If the defendants were not lessees when the ice sued for was taken they were strangers to the title and had no right to enter upon the premises. 8trout and Holmes, and E. P.

Basement fob Light and Aib—User—Ownership of Adjoining Lot. The doctrine that a proprietor of land may by user acquire an easement over adjoining land for the passage of light and air does not prevail in this country, and merely owning the adjoining lot cannot give the proprietors such an easement. Id,—Poweb of Legislature—Nuisance.—It is not competent for the legislature to vest in an adjoining proprietor the power to prevent his neighbor from building such structure as he pleases, provided it is not a nuisance, and it is not a nuisance merely because it obstructs the passage of light and air. Id.—Act Regulating Division Bences—Constitutional Law.—The act of March 9, 1885, regulating the height of division fences and partition walls in cities and towns is a general law, and is to be construed so as to not render it unconstitutional; and so construed, it prevents the erection of a partition wall or division fence resting upon the division line between adjoining proprietors more than ten feet in height; but it does not prevent the erection of any kind of a structure of greater height wholly upon the land of an adjoining proprietor, although such structure may prevent the passage of light and air into the windows of the adjoining building. Id,—Injunction Against Division Fence—Effect of Judgment.—A defendant may be properly enjoined from erecting or maintaining any fence more than ten feet high on the division line, and may be required to remove all that portion of the division fence which is more than ten feet high, and be enjoined from obstructing the light and air coming from his premises into the windows upon the adjoining land by any division fence or wall more than ten feet high; but such judgment has no effect upon the right of the defendant to erect any structure of greater height upon his own land. Appeal from a judgment of® the Superior Court of Santa Clara County, and from an order denying a new trial. The facts are stated in the opinion. William L. Gill, for Appellants. No easement in light and air exists in this state, and the act of the legislature of March 9, 1885, regulating the height of division fences is unconstitutional. (Const., art. XI, sec. 11; Const., art. I, sec. 11.) D. W. Burchard, for Respondent.

In an action involving a dispute as to the boundary between the north and south halves of lot 2 in a block of four lots numbered from the south, which contained more land than that shown on the official plat of the city, wherein defendant, owning lot 1 and the south half of lot 2, claimed that the surplus was a part of the street bounding the block on the south as originally surveyed and platted, evidence held to support findings in favor of defendant’s claim as to the location of the line, and to show that plaintiffs thereby received the land they bought.

The city hid not exceed or abuse its power to the prejudice of plaintiffs by waiving whatever title or right it had to such surplus. (Page 624.) 4. Costs — Statutory Provisions — Strict Construction. As costs were not recoverable at common law and the right to costs is purely statutory, statutes authorizing them are strictly construed. (Page 625.) 5. Costs — Cost Bill — Time for Filing and Serving. Under Comp. Laws 1907, Sec. 3350, providing that the party in whose favor judgment is rendered and who claims his costs must deliver to the clerk and serve upon the adverse party within five days after the verdict or notice of decision of the court or referee a memorandum of the items of his costs and necessary disbursements, the filing and service of the cost bill before the entry of the finding and decree was not a substantial compliance with the statute, and the cost bill should have been stricken.

This is an action to quiet title to a portion of lot 2, block 19, plat E, Salt Lake City survey, Utah. Block 19, of which the land in dispute forms a part, is bounded on the south by Third North street, formerly called Plum street; on the north by Fourth North street, formerly called Peach street; on the east by Wall street; and on the west by North Main street, formerly called Oak street. Block 19, as platted, consists of a tier of four lots. The lots, commencing at the south end of the tier, are numbered 1, 2, 3 and 4. According to the official plat of Salt Lake City, filed April 2, 1888, the width of each of the four lots north and south is as follows: Lot 1, 5 rods; lot 2, 7 rods; lot 3, 10 rods, and lot 4, 12 4/10 rods. It is conceded that Block 19 in a. northerly and southerly direction contains approximately 52 feet of surplus ground. The defendant contends that the 52 feet of surplus ground is the south end of the block and abuts on Third North street, and that the distance from the north side of the street to the north boundary line of lot 2 is approximately 250 feet. Plain-iffs, on the other hand, insist that the distance between these points is 198 feet — J.2 rods. And they, in effect, claim, if we correctly understand their position, that the 52 feet of surplus ground lies between the north boundary line of lot 2 and the south boundary of lot 4. That is, lot 3, which the maps and plats in evidence of block 19 show to be 10 rods only in width in a northerly and southerly direction is in fact a little in excess of 13 rods in width. John A. Houghton, one of the plaintiffs, testified in part as follows: “I owned the north half of lot 2, and if there was any excess up there it was either in lot 3 or we had a quitclaim deed to it. * * * I don’t know where the excess is. I said I owned everything between the south half of lot 2 and 4. Where the boundaries of lot 3 are I don’t know. If there is any excess in there I claim it.” Plaintiffs allege in their complaint, and in their reply to defendant’s counterclaim, that they and their predecessors for more than 7 years last past have owned and possessed all of the south half of lot 2 in said block 19, described as follows: ‘ ‘ Commencing at a point 140.25 feet north, 28 deg. 8 min. west of the southwest corner of lot one (1) in said block, said southwest corner of said lot one (1) being 26.13 feet east and 22.5 feet north of the present monument located at the intersection of Main and Third North streets in Salt Lake City; running thence northwesterly along Main street 57.75 feet; thence east parallel with the south boundary line of lot one (1) to Wall street; thence southeasterly along Wall street to a point 57.75 feet northwesterly along said Wall street from the northeast corner of Margaret L. Taylor’s land, and from the northeast corner of said lot one (1); thence west parallel with the south boundary of lot one (1) to place of beginning. ’ ’ Defendant, in his answer and counterclaim, among other things, alleges that he and his predecessors, for more than 20 years next preceding the commencement of this action, have owned and have been in the actual possession of the following described property in block 19, plat E, Salt Lake City survey: ‘' Commencing at a point 26.13 feet east and 22.5 feet north from the present monument located at the intersection of what is called Main and Third North streets, Salt Lake City, Utah, running thence north 24 deg. 8 min. west 192.12 feet; thence east on a line parallel with the monument line on Third North street aforesaid 216.78 feet; thence south 30 deg. 11 min. east 115.60 feet to the northeast comer of Margaret L. Taylor’s land; thence west along the north line of Margaret L. Taylor’s land and parallel with the monument line on Third North street aforesaid 81.55 feet to the northwest corner of said Margaret L. Taylor’s land; thence south 75.4 feet to the southwest corner of said Margaret L. Taylor’s land; thence west and parallel with the monument line on Third North street aforesaid 114.815 feet to the place of beginning. ’ ’ It is further alleged: “That during all of said time defendant and his predecessors have occupied, cultivated, and improved said property and have subjected the same to ordinary use; that they have maintained and protected the same by substantial inclosures, and have paid all the taxes that have been levied and assessed against the same according to law; that such possession, during all of said time, h’as been continuous, perpetual, peaceable, and without interference or disturbance of any character, and has been open and notorious and adverse against these plaintiffs and all the world. ’ ’ He also alleges that plaintiffs’ cause of action is barred by the provisions of Comp. Laws 1907, section 2859, which reads as follows: “No action for the recovery of real property, or for the possession thereof, shall be maintained, unless it appear that the plaintiff, his ancestor, grantor, or predecessor was seized or possessed of the property in question within seven years before the commencement of the action.” On the issues presented by the pleadings the trial court made the following findings of fact: “(1) That in 1887, one Ezra Jarvis purchased and received an executed deed, transferring to said Ezra Jarvis, the north half of lot 2, block 19, plat E, Salt Lake City survey, situated in Salt Lake County, Utah; and the said Ezra Jarvis immediately took possession of certain property in said block, and believed by the said Ezra Jarvis to be the said north half of said lot and block, and upon which said Ezra Jarvis constructed a brick dwelling house consisting of two rooms. “ (2) That in about the year 1889 one Hyrum Barton entered into the possession of the following described property in Salt Lake County, Utah, to wit (describing the property above mentioned in defendant’s counterclaim). “(3) That upon the said property described, possession of which was taken by said Hyrum Barton, and near the northwest corner of.the same, was situated the said brick house which was constructed by said Ezra Jarvis. That upon taking possession of the said property, including the said brick house, the said HyrUm Barton constructed fences around and inclosed the same, and that since about the year 1890' the defendant herein and his predecessor, Hyrum Barton, have been in the actual, open, undisturbed, peaceable, and notorious possession of the said property, claiming the same as owners thereof, and planted thereon rose bushes and trees, and constructed and maintained fences thereon and constructed and maintained buildings, and also the said Hyrum Barton constructed reservoirs and irrigation ditches to be used for the purpose of irrigating the vegetation on the said property ; * * * and that during all of said periods, and up to the time of the trial of this action, defendant and his predecessors in interest have held continuous, perpetual, undisturbed, and peaceable possession of said property, and claim to be the owners thereof as against the plaintiffs in this action and all other persons whomsoever. * * * “ (5) That for a'period of moré than 7 years immediately preceding the commencement of this action the plaintiffs, nor either of them, nor their predecessors in interest, nor any of them, at any time, have been seized or possessed, or in possession, of the said property hereinbefore described, or any part thereof. ‘«^6) * * * “(7) That in the year 1899 the property whereon the said house constructed by said Ezra Jarvis was situated, and which said land is hereinbefore specifically described, and which the said Hyrum Barton was then in possession of, together with the said house, was assessed to Hyrum Barton and thereafter continuously and to and including the year 1909, the said property, together with the said house, was assessed to Hyrum Barton, and that he, the said Hyrum Barton, and his successors in interest paid the taxes on the said property for each and every year, and remained in possession thereof, claiming to be the owners thereof. ■ “ (8) That in the year 1901 the said Hyrum Barton died, and that thereupon this defendant, together with the other heirs of the estate, entered into and held possession of the said property, claiming the same exclusively and by right of absolute ownership in fee, and paid all taxes assessed against the same, including taxes for sewer, water tax, and general tax; and that in the year 1912 the defendant laid cement sidewalks in front of the said property, both where the same abuts on Wall street and where the same abuts on Main street. “ (9) That the plaintiffs are owners of the north half of lot 2, block 19, plat E, Salt Lake City survey, Salt Lake County, Utah, and that the defendant is the owner and is entitled to the possession of the south half of lot 2, said block, plat, and survey, and that the dividing line between the said properties should be located as follows: Commencing at a point north 24 deg. 8 min. west 192.12 feet from the south.west corner of block 19, plat E, Salt Lake City survey as now claimed, and which said comer of block 19 is 26.13 feet east and 22.5 feet north of the present monument located at the intersection of what is known as Main and Third North streets. From said point of beginning running east 216.78 feet more or less to Wall street on a line parallel with the monument line on Third North street as now established.” The conclusions of law and the decree made and entered by the court are responsive to, and in conformity with] the findings of fact.

Eminent domain — Measure of compensation—Temporary inconveniences— Cause of action—Damnum absque injuria. Where, in the construction of the subway in the city of New York through that part of Fourth avenue lying between Fourteenth and Seventeenth streets opposite Union Square, the contractor began work on the west side of the roadway and excavated a trench twenty-five feet deep, extending eastward to a point near the street railway tracks, and then, in order to take care of the railway, which was operated by electricity, and the electric cables and conduits that belonged to it, built a structure, elevated above the surface of the street, upon which the car tracks were laid and through which the cables ran, so that the work of excavation might proceed beneath it and eastwardly to the east curb of the roadway, which structure was fenced on the sides, except at the street intersections where a sloping incline led down to the level of the side streets; and where it appears that the structure could have been avoided, if the excavation had been begun from the east side, and that it might have been built over the excavation on the west side; but that, on account of the character of the excavation, the hazard to the buildings would have been greater if begun on the east side and, on account of the surrounding conditions, the erection of the structure for the railway on the west side would have unduly delayed the work and increased its costs and, for such reasons, the suggested changes in the method of prosecuting the work, though possible, were not feasible; and where it appeared that the plaintiffs, who had a drug store on the southeast corner of Fourth avenue and Seventeenth street, suffered loss in their business in consequence of the inconvenience to their patrons who came in carriages, resulting from the elevated structure in front of their store, where was the only entrance to it, held, that the action of the contractor was authorized by law; that it exercised the skill and care contemplated by the law in the execution of its work and is not liable in damages to the plaintiff.

In order to constitute an estoppel in pais against the legal owner of real estate, by reason of his voluntary representations in regard to a boundary line, it should appear that the party sought to be estopped, must have been guilty oí constructive fraud or gross neglect in regard to the subject matter claimed as an estoppel, in order to conclude him from asserting the fact as it really exists. Or, in other words, there must have been an express design that the act or statement should influence the action of another. This action was brought to quiet the title to certain real estate in Ramsey county, under the statute relating to actions to determine conflicting claims to real estate. Stats, of Mm,., p. 595, chap. 64. The issues of fact were referred to Geo. L. Otis, special referee to hear the testimony, and from his report 'the Court below found the following facts: On the 17th January, 1855, one Staples conveyed to one Eleanor Story a certain portion of lot three, block sixty-two, in Irvine’s enlargement of Rice and Irvine’s, addition to St. Paul, describing it by metes and bounds, so as to front 57 feet on Pleasant street and running back 106 feet. Eleanor Story .and husband conveyed the same to the Plaintiff, Combs, on the 20th April, 1855. That on the 7th March, 1855, said Staples, conveyed to one Charles H. Parker “ lot number three, in block sixty-two, (in same enlargement,) being fifty-seven feet on Oak street and ninety feet deep, more or less.” On the 10th September, 1855, Parker and wife conveyed the property last described to the Defendant Cooper. The deeds were all warranty deeds, and were duly recorded at or about their respective dates. That the two descriptions contained in these deeds comprised the whole of said lot three — the westerly portion thereof, fronting on Pleasant street, having been conveyed to Combs, and the easterly portion thereof, on Oak street, to the Defendant. The depth of the lot, between said streets, was 190 31-100 feet. That soon after the date of the deedhforesaid to said Plaintiff he entered into actual possession of said prémises, and commenced the erection of improvements thereon. That the said Charles II. Parker, at or about the same time, commenced the erection of improvements upon the lot conveyed to him as aforesaid. That a short time prior to the date of the deed aforesaid to the Defendant, the said Plaintiff and said Parker had a conference as to the situation or location of the dividing line between them. That the said Parker pointed out to the said Plaintiff' a certain stake as the point of intersection of the north line of said lot three with said Pleasant street. That said Plaintiff (believing said stake to be the true point of intersection of said line with said street,) and the said Parker, then measured off on said line a distance oí 106 feet from said Pleasant street, leaving as the distance to said Oak street ninety feet, and which included in its limits a certain spring of water which previously had been walled up and rendered suitable for use by the said Parker. That thereupon the Plaintiff and the said Parker, mutually believing that each was obtaining his full quantity of land, according to their respective deeds of the same, expressly agreed that said point of termination of 106 feet from the stake aforesaid should be considered the division corner between their respective portions of said lot three, and that a fence should be constructed from said division corner by a line parallel with said Oak street to the southerly line of said lot three. That said fence should be considered the division line between them. That said fence was thereupon built along said line, and was so built at or soon after the date of the deed aforesaid to said Defendant, and the same is still standing. That the portion of lot three, so designated as belonging to said Parker, contained upon it the spring of water aforesaid at the date of said deed to defendant, and was thereby greatly enhanced in value. That the said Defendant, just prior to the date of his purchase of said easterly portion of lot three, had a conversation with said Plaintiff in regard to the division line between the said property. That at the time of this conversation the division fence aforesaid had not been completed, but its location was designated and mai’ked out, along the lino agreed upon as aforesaid, by stakes and pieces of board, so as to be plainly visible. That said Defendant, during said conversation, stated to said Plaintiff that he (Defendant) was about to purchase said property of the said Parker, and wished to ascertain the division line. That said Plaintiff thereupon pointed out the said stakes and pieces of boards as indicating the said line of division, and stated that Mr. Parker had agreed to build the division fence along said line. That at this time said Plaintiff and Defendant supposed and believed that said line was the true dividing line between the said property, according to the terms of their said deeds. That said Defendant purchased the said property of the said Parker, relying upon the aforesaid statements of said Plaintiff as to the said line of division. That said Plaintiff, shortly after the said conversation, erected, at considerable expense, a fence, along what he supposed to be the line of Pleasant street, in front of his said part of said lot, as designated by the stake pointed out by the said Parker as aforesaid. That he built upon his said lot a dwelling house, the location of which was determined by the said supposed line of Pleasant street. That said front fence remained some three years, when it was removed by order of Street Commis sioners, as being in said Pleasant street, and not on the easterly line thereof. That the true line of Pleasant street was and is 6 feet and 6-10 of a foot farther east than was indicated by the said front fence. That the said division fence was the same distance further east than the true division line between the property aforesaid, according to the terms of the said deed to said Plaintiff. That there was a strip of land 6 6-10 feet in width across the whole width of lot three aforesaid, set over to that part of said lot three, purchased by said Defendant, which did not belong to it according to the terms- of the said deed to the said Plaintiff. That said Defendant has been in possession of said strip of land since the date of his said deed and until the present time, and is still in possession of the same by virtue of the said agreement between said Plaintiff and said Parker. That said Plaintiff, before the commencement of this action, duly demanded possession thereof of the said Defendant, which was refused. That no survey of said lot three (3), for the purpose of ascertaining the true line of division between said Plaintiff and said Parker, was made until long after the purchase by said Defendant as aforesaid, and no line of division between said parties existed prior to the making of tbe division line as aforesaid. That the line of division so marked out by the said Plaintiff and the said Parker was acquiesced in as being the true line of division for three’ years by the said Plaintiff. That in the year 1857 the Plaintiff, being about to sell his said premises, procured a survey thereof to be made, when he discovered for the first time that the said division fence did not stand on the true line between himself and said Defendant, but was 6 6-10 feet further east than it should have been in order to give to said Plaintiff the number of feet called for in his said deed. Upon the foregoing facts the Court found, as conclusions of law, that an express agreement as to the location of a division line between owners of contiguous lands, when the true line had not been previously ascertained, though by parol, if executed immediately and possession taken in accordance therewith, is binding and conclusive upon the parties to such agreement, and those claiming under them. That in case of such express agreement and immediate execution, where the same have had the effect to induce a party to purchase and erect valuable improvements, neither party ought to be allowed to rescind the agreement, although it was made in ignorance of his rights, and does not locate the line truly according to the title deeds of the said lands. That the Plaintiff is estopped from claiming as his own any part of said lot three which lies east of said division fence. I further find that said Defendant is entitled to judgment in this action according to the prayer of his answer herein. From this decision of the Court the Plaintiff appealed.

       "  'case_summary': \"John McElrath, plaintiff in error, vs. Sallie B. Haley et al., defendants in error. (Atlanta, January Term, 1873.) 1. Wills — Evidence—Acts and Sayings of Testator. — In 1862, Roath purchased lot number forty-five, in the city of Augusta, with a front of sixty feet, and running from Ellis to Greene street, and was residing on it when, in March, 1866, he purchased lot number forty-four, a vacant lot adjacent to number forty-five, of the same front and running the same length as number forty-five. He used part of lot forty-four as a flower garden, and part as a vegetable garden. There was a fence around both lots, and a fence divided them when Roath purchased forty-five, and the evidence is conflicting as to the time when the dividing fence was taken down by Roath, whether it was before or after the execution of his will. In Roath made his *will, and in one item “devised and bequeathed my house and lot on Ellis street, in the city of Augusta, where I- now reside, to my wife for her natural life, and after her death, to my two nieces, M. and S. B. Crocker.” In another item, he gave all the balance of his estate, real and personal, to his wife, absolutely. Testator died in November, 1867: Held, That the acts and sayings of Roath, which go to show that, at the time of the execution of the will, he considered and treated the two lots as one and as constituting the house and lot where he then resided, are competent as evidence in behalf of the .remaindermen in an action of ejectment brought after the death of the wife of Roath to recover lot number forty-four. 3. Evidence — -Admissions “With a View to Compromise” — New Trial. — The widow of Roath had built a house on forty-five, had married again and died, ’and the action was against her second' husband. On the trial, one of the plaintiffs testified, by interrogatories, that the widow of Roath, some time after the building of the house, said to her, (plaintiff,) “She was a fool for building the house, and if she had her way she would tear it down, if she could get her money back.” And further testified, over defendant’s objection, “She also said she had been to see her lawyers, Barnes & Cumming, and they told her * * * she offered, if we would do -this, to give us up the house on Ellis street, but this was never done:” ■ Held, That it was error to admit that portion of the testimony objected to by defendant. If it was an^ offer of compromise, it was illegal testimony. If otherwise admissible, the whole of what she said should have been stated, and if stated, should have gone to the jury. Where the evidence is conflicting, and illegal testimony be admitted which might, and probably did, injure the party objecting, a new trial will be granted. Will. Evidence. New trial. Offers of compromise. Before Judge Twiggs. Richmond Superior Court. October Term, 1872., Sallie B. Haley, formerly Sallie B. Crocker, and Mabel E. Crocker, brought complaint against John McElrath for lots numbers forty-four and forty-five, in sub-divisions of the city of Augusta, as found on map prepared by William Phillips. The record fails to disclose the plea filed by the defendant. The evidence made the following case: On July 1st, 1862, David L. Roath purchased from W. J. Reed lot number forty-five, in the city of Augusta, with the improvements thereon, fronting on Ellis street sixty feet, and running back to Greene *street, of the same width. Roath resided on this lot until his death, in the fall of 1867. On March 22d, 1866, he purchased from Henry H. Cumming lot number forty-four, fronting sixty feet on Ellis street, running back of the same width to Greene street; and adjoining on the west lot number forty-five. At the time of this second purchase, there was a dividing fence between the two lots. The evidence is conflicting as to when this fence to the rear of the house on number forty-five was removed. Roath used the front portion of this last purchase as a flower garden, and the back portion as a vegetable garden. On September 22d, 1866, he made his will, containing the following provisions: ‘■‘Item 1st. I devise and bequeath my house and lot on Ellis street, in the city of Augusta, where I now reside, to my dear wife, Frances A., for her natural life, and after her death to my two nieces, Mabel E. and Sallie B. Crocker, to be held in trust for my two nieces during their lives. “2d. My accounts as guardian of my nieces, Mabel E. and Sallie B. Crocker, show a considerable indebtedness from them to me. I discharge and release this indebtedness entirely. “3d. All the rest and residue of my estate of every kind and description, real and personal and mixed, notes, bonds, money and accounts I give, devise and bequeath to my said wife, Frances A., absolutely and forever. “4th. I direct that there be no inventory or appraisement of my estate made, and expressly relieve my executrix from the necessity of making annual or any other returns to the Court of Ordinary or to any other Court. “5th. I appoint my said wife, Frances A. Roath, executrix of this my last will and testament.” Sallie B. Crocker married E. W. Haley, on October 10th, 1868. Mrs. Roath built a house on lot number forty-four during the year 1868. She spent in improvements over $2,400 00, which amount she realized from the sale of railroad stock. After she completed the house she married the defendant. She died on June 10th, 1871. The plaintiffs sought to show by the acts and declarations *of the testator that at the time of the execution of his will he considered lots numbers forty — four and forty-five as together constituting one lot, to-wit, the lot whereon he then resided; that he treated them as one lot, and that in all the plans for the future, in connection with his house, he was governed by this idea. All of this testimony was objected to, the objection was overruled, and the defendant excepted. In answer to 9th interrogatory propounded to Sallie B. Haley, she stated that Mrs. Roath “remarked to her, some time after she had built the house on Greene street, that she was a fool for building it; that if she had her way she would tear it down, if she could only get her money back. She also said that she had been to see her lawyers, Barnes & Cumming, and they told her * * * She offered, if we would do this, to give up the house on Ellis street, but this was never done.” The defendant objected to the last two sentences of this answer. The objection was overruled and the defendant excepted. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs. Whereupon, the defendant moved for a new trial upon the following, among -other grounds: 1st. Because the verdict is contrary to the law and the evidence. 2d. Because the Court overruled the objection of defendant to the admissibility of other parol testimony than what was 'necessary to ascertain and fix the lot in dispute, the objection being that no other parol testimony was admissible in this case to aid in the construction of the will. 3d. Because the Court erred in overruling the objection of defendant to the admissibility of the following testimony, contained in the answers of Mrs. Haley to 8th direct interrogatory addressed to her, to-wit: “She also said she had been to see her lawyers, Barnes & Cumming, and they told her * * * She offered, if we would do this, to give up the house on Ellis street, but this was never done;” and allowed said testimony to go to the jury, *the ground of objection being that said testimony was irrelevant, and improper to be considered by the jury. The motion was overruled, and the defendant excepted upon each of the grounds aforesaid. Barnes & Cumming, for plaintiff in error. Frank H. Mirrer, for defendants. * Evidence — Admissions—“With View to Compromise” — New Trial. —“Evidence that the owner refused to pay the broker, but offered as a compromise to pay a fixed amount and to give another specified amount to a church, is inadmissible under the rule that propositions made with a view to a compromise are not proper evidence.” Emery v. Atlanta, etc., Exchange, 88 Ga. 321, 14 S. E. Rep. 556, citing with approval the principal case. Same — Same—Same.—“Where plaintiff was interrogated by defendant on the stand touching certain admissions made in the presence of certain persons and at a certain time, and did not set up what he said was in reference and with a view to compromise the case, but gave his version of the conversation, the defendant should be allowed to give his version of the same transaction by himself or the witnesses present, and such version of plaintiff’s admissions should not be ruled out because made in reference to compromise.” Scales v. Shackleford, 64 Ga. 173, is distinguished from the principal case.\",\n",

In construing the description of the premises, contained in a deed, what is most material and certain governs that which is less so. Upon this principle a known stream, marked tree, or monument, governs both course and distance ; and in such case the call for course and distance is disregarded. 2. A grant is to be taken most strongly against the grantor; and where a deed may enure in different ways, the grantee shall have his election which way to take it. 3. Where the property to be described and conveyed by a grantor owning land extending from Greenwich to Washington street, was a portion fronting on Greenwich, and not on Washington street; and the description commenced at a fixed point on Greenwich street, and the deed then called for seven courses, each course running a certain definite distance; these courses and definite distances leading to a certain, definite fixed point; Held that when the deed said that that point was distant 86 feet 6 inches, or thereabouts, from Washington street, the indefinite and uncertain point indicated by the word “ thereabouts ” must give way to the more definite and certain point fixed by the courses and distances from Greenwich street. 4. Held, also, that under both of the above principles, the southern line of the property intended to be conveyed must be regarded as terminating at this definite point; and under the second of those principles, the northerly line at the point to which the distance from Greenwich street would carry it, as that was the more favorable to the grantee. 6. If the boundaries of the land intended to be conveyed can be easily and definitely settled by construing the description in the deed in accordance with established principles of construction, evidence of declarations or user is inadmissible to aid in such construction. 6. The doctrine appertaining to actual location of a boundary only applies where it is shown that both parties, or those -under whom they claim, agreed on the location qi the boundary; or where the party claiming the location to be incorrect, or those through whom he claims, himself or themselves made the location. 7. The doctrine respecting the settlement of a disputed boundary only applies when there has been a dispute as to the boundary, and that dispute has been adjusted by running the line according to the agreement for its adjustment. (Before McCunn and Jones, JJ.) Heard December 14, 1867; decided December, 1868. Appeal from a judgment entered upon the report of a referee. On the 2d day of July, 1835, Eli Hart, being the owner of a certain plot of ground extending from Greenwich to Washington street, sold and conveyed to William J. Bunker a portion thereof, fronting on Greenwich street. The description of the property conveyed to Bunker, as contained in the deed to him, was as follows: “ Beginning at a point on the westerly side of Greenwich street, distant fifty-six feet and three inches or thereabouts from the northerly side of Courtlandt street, and funning thence westerly along ground’ now or formerly of the heirs or devisees of George Marshall, and along ground now or formerly of the heirs of Michael Price, and along ground now or formerly of the heirs of John Rogers, ninety-five feet; thence northerly along ground now or late of George P. Rogers, • four feet six inches; thence westerly along ground now or late of the said George P. Rogers, thirteen feet nine inches ; thence southerly along ground now or late of said George P. Rogers, four feet six inches; thence westerly along ground now or late of the said George P. Rogers, ten feet four inches; thence northerly along ground now or late of Daniel B. Dash, thirteen feet; thence westerly' along ground now or late of said Dash, fifteen feet six inches, to a point distant eighty-six feet six inches or thereabouts from Washington street, being to the middle of a certain brick wall or fence, running across the rear of the lots hereby conveyed; thence northerly along the middle of said fence or wall forty feet five inches, or thereabouts, to ground now of formerly of John L. Van Kleeck, at a point distant ninety-eight feet six inches, or thereabouts, from Washington street; thence easterly along ground now or formerly of said Van Kleeek, one hundred and eight feet and nine inches, or thereabouts, to Greenwich street; thence southerly along the westerly side of Greenwich street fifty-two feet six inches, more or less, to the place of beginning.” The plaintiff is now the owner of the portion conveyed to Bunker, claiming through several mesne conveyances. Eli Hart never sold the remaining portion fronting on Washington street, and it still belongs to his estate. The defendants, however, are lessees thereof from his estate. The dispute in this case is as to where the westerly line of the property sold to Bunker is. The plaintiff claims it is line A B on the annexed diagram; the defendant that it is line C D. The action is brought to restrain the defendants from using the rear wall of the building fronting on Greenwich street, which is erected on line C D, and also from occupying or using the space between lines A B and G D. The action was referred. The referee reported that the plaintiff’s westerly boundary line was G D, and therefore the defendants had a right to use the triangular space. He also reported that the plaintiff’s wall, built on line C D, was out of plumb and encroached on the defendants’ property by leaning over it, and that the defendants had a right to use it, to the extent of such encroachment. He therefore gave judgment for the defendants, on the whole, case, and the plaintiff appealed. Charles Jones, for-the plaintiff, appellant. 8. H. Lyon, for the defendants, respondents.

In an action for damages caused by sheep destroying plaintiff’s hay, where the petition charged that the sheep were intentionally driven upon the hay and intentionally permitted to eat it, plaintiff could recover only on proof of a willful trespass. 2. In an action for damages caused -by sheep in eating, trampling down and destroying plaintiff’s hay, evidence held to prove a willful trespass. 3. Owners of sheep driven or intentionally permitted by a herder to go upon and destroy hay belonging to another are liable to him for damages unless he is so far without right in the premises as to justify a willful appropriation. 4. Where a purchaser of hay was permitted to leave it on the premises for' a reasonable time, sheep owners who subsequently purchased a lease, though entitled to the exclusive possession of the premises, were not entitled to intentionally permit sheep to eat and destroy such hay, though at such time the purchaser of the hay had no rights on the premises. 5. Where a purchaser of hay was permitted to leave the hay stacked on land for a reasonable time, and the land was thereafter sold to one who consented that the hay might remain on the land, to which arrangement a lessee and lessee’s assignee made no objections, the hay was upon the premises rightfully by license while the premises were in possession of such assignee, so as to entitle the purchaser of the hay to recover for the willful destruction thereof by the assignee’s sheep. 6. A license may be created by parol as well as in writing, and may be implied from the acts of the parties, from their relations, and from usage and custom. 7. When the owner of land, with full knowledge of the facts, tacitly permits another repeatedly to do acts upon the land, a license to do such acts may be implied from owner’s failure to object. 8. In an action for damage caused by defendant’s sheep eating and destroying plaintiff’s hay stacked on land occupied by defendants as lessees, testimony that lessor had permitted hay to remain on the land held admissable as against objection that the lease was the best evidence and contained no such reservation, such testimony being competent to prove license by lessee’s predecessors, and the subsequent consent of the lessee recognizing and continuing such license. 9. In an action for damages involving the issue whether defendant’s sheep had been driven or intentionally permitted to go upon plaintiff’s hay, evidence as to the condition of the fences inclosing the haystaeks was admis-sble, being competent to show what plaintiff had done to distinguish his hay from other hay on the premises, and to serve as a foundation for other testimony on an issue of whether trespass was intentional or willful. 10.In an action for damages caused by sheep destroying hay on premises in possession of defendants, the admission of evidence as to the condition of the fence enclosing haystacks was not rendered erroneous by an instruction that whether haystacks were enclosed by a lawful or any fence was wholly immaterial, if the jury should find that the sheep had been driven or intentionally permitted to go upon plaintiff’s hay; there being no inconsistency between the evidence and the instruction. 11. Where a witness, being cross-examined, evaded giving re-sponsivé answers to counsel’s questions, and addressed insulting remarks to counsel, such as “You better clean out your ears,” the action of court in admonishing witness by a statement, “This is no vaudeville show,” and „ “The court is incensed with the attitude of the witness on the stand,” held not objectionable, as against the contention that the court’s statement constituted a comment on the credibility of witness. 12. The conduct of a witness may require comment by the court by way of caution, admonition, or censure, and, when such comment is within due bounds and appropriate to the character of the occurrence, it will not be subject to a valid exception. 13. In an action for damages caused by sheep destroying hay stacked on land occupied by defendants, who were charged with willful trespass, an instruction on the duty of the parties as to fences stating that plaintiff was not required to fence, and that it was the duty of defendants to restrain their sheep, held not objectionable as imposing on defendants the duty of guarding plaintiff’s hay. 14. An action for damages caused by sheep destroying hay stacked on land occupied by defendants, whether plaintiff could have done more than he did to prevent the damage after discovery of the trespass, held, a question for the jury. 15. In an action for damages caused by sheep destroying hay stacked on land occupied by defendants, a requested instruction that plaintiff could not recover for loss of “any” hay left on land which he could have used, or for a loss of his cattle through lack of food, held properly refused, because plaintiff was not seeking to recover for hay not destroyed, and because he was thereby denied recovery for loss of cattle regardless of quantity of hay left. 16. In an action for damages caused by sheep destroying hay, where the court charged that defendants would not be liable except on proof of a willful driving of sheep on hay or the intentional permitting them to go thereon, a requested instruction that no duty was imposed on the defendants to dog their sheep for the purpose of keeping them from plaintiff’s hay was properly refused, as misleading. 17. In an action for damages caused by sheep destroying hay, an instruction that defendants were Háble for the acts of their employes, including the foreman in charge of the sheep, held, warranted by evidence that such foreman was present at the time of the trespass complained of. 18. Evidence held sufficient to sustain a verdict as to damages for loss of hay destroyed by trespassing sheep and for loss of cattle deprived of food. Appeal from the District Court, Johnson County, Hon. James H. Burgess, Judge. Action by John B. Kendrick against Patrick Healy, Jr., and Alexander Healy, co-partners doing business under the firm name of Healy Brothers, to recover damages alleged to have been caused by trespassing sheep. Judgment for plaintiff and defendant appeals. Sill and Griggs, and E. E. Enterline, for Appellants. The case was presented, by plaintiff in the trial court upon the theory that defendants were bailees of the hay in question. It was sought by the plaintiff during the trial to fix responsibility upon the defendants for the care of the hay, plaintiff declining to assume any responsibility whatever for the care of the hay at the time of the alleged trespass; (5 Cyc. 165; 3 R. C. L. 72) ; there had been no delivery or acceptance by defendants; at the trial, plaintiff amended his petition by interlineation; thereunder a mass of testimony was received with reference to the character of the fence surrounding the hay stacks, it being the apparent purpose to show that the stacks were surrounded by a lawful fence as defined by See. 2578 C. S. 1910, Chapter 18, Laws 1917. This was received over objection of defendants and was prejudicial; damages in such case being limited to horses, mules and cattle who breach a lawful fence, 2581 C. S. 1910. The court erred in admitting testimony of witness Duffy with reference to hay on the Redman land; the court erred in- excluding cross examination of witness Duffy which was material on the question of possession; defendants were under no obligation to keep their sheep away from the vicinity of the stack yards since they were entitled to posses sion of all parts of the' premises; plaintiff purchased the hay at $3.00 per ton; there was evidence that much of it was spoiled and worthless; plaintiff sued for $20- per ton which was allowed by the jury; neglect of the herder to keep the sheep away from stacks did not establish willful trespass. The agreement between the Northern Wyoming Land Co. and Hoffman was in writing and was therefore the best evidence of the nature of plaintiff’s possession; The court’s attitude toward the witness Hoffman was prejudicial to defendants and a clear invasion of the province of the jury; a number of instructions given on request of plaintiff were highly prejudicial to defendants and defendants were prejudiced by the refusal of the trial court to give the instructions requested by defendants; it devolved upon plaintiff to make some effort to prevent the alleged damage, (13 Cyc. 71); to use reasonable efforts to lessen the result in damage, (8 R. C. L. 446; Sweeney v. R. R. Co., 25 Mont. 543; Devine Min. Co. 1. Mallin, 165 Pac. 1113) ; the court instructed in substance that it was defendants’ duty to restrain their sheep from going upon plaintiff’s hay and that plaintiff was not required to fence or protect his hay against defendants’ sheep; this instruction was inconsistent with the other instruction given on the question of trespass. (Eckman v. Westman, 20 Wyo. 143; Pac. 89); defendants’ possession of the land was clearly established, and defendants were entitled to an instruction as to their right of possession. (Kahn v. Ins. Co., 4 Wyo. 419) ; plaintiff was allowed $845.00 for 13 head of cattle alleged to have died for want of feed, when, as a matter of fact, it was shown that plaintiff’s cattle had foot and mouth disease, and there was no proof that any cattle had died for want of feed, the verdict of the jury having undoubtedly been influenced by prejudice and passion, and should be set aside. Metz & Sacketi, and Robert Rose, for Respondent. Plaintiff’s action for damages caused! by trespassing sheep of defendants’; answer first denies generally, and offers affirmative defenses: 1. An exclusive right to the land where the hay was stacked. 2. The stacks were unfenced. 3. Absence of fence precludes the remedy for loss of the hay. 4. Plaintiff removed the fence. 5. It was impossible to keep the sheep away from the hay. 6. The hay was worthless. The second defense, which includes the foregoing points practically admits intentional trespass; it is admitted that the fence question is immaterial as sheep could pass through a lawful fence; testimony showed that plaintiff’s hay was not invaded by the sheep until defendants’ hay was all gone and no hay could be obtained in the community; it never was a custom for sheep to run at large; the only fence ever required in the Avest is against horses and cattle; the right of stock to run at large does not apply to sheep in the care of a herder. (Willard v. Mathesus, 7 Colo. 76; Healy v. Smith, 14 Wyo. 287; Light v. U. S.., 31 SCR. 488, 2 col., 477 foot 2nd col. and top 1st col. 488; Lazarus v. Phelps, 14 SCR. 478, foot 1st col. and 2nd col, arguendo: Cosgriff v. Miller, 10 Wyo. 216-17, 223, 225; Thompson v. Corpstein, 52 Cal. 653) ; plaintiff had a license from defendant to keep his hay on the premises; the evidence clearly established a license; defendants ’ sheep were herded away at night and brought back to plaintiff’s hay in the morning and were herded into and upon the stacks; the loss of plaintiff’s hay also resulted in the loss of about 25 head of cattle ; the court placed the burden upon plaintiff of proving that all damages were caused by the intentional trespass ; this was certainly as far as the court could go in favor of defendant; the court instructed the jury that defendants had a right to run their sheep on the premises and were not required to fence plaintiff’s hay, but were required not to drive or intentionally permit their sheep to destroy plaintiff’s hay; defendants could not well complain of the instructions ; the court instructed the jury that it was immaterial whether the stacks were enclosed by a lawful fence or any fence at all, so long as it was shown that defendants intentionally permitted their sheep to go upon and eat and destroy plaintiff’s hay. There was nothing misleading about this instruction; there was a clear preponderence of evidence establishing intentional trespass.\",\n",

       "  'case_summary': \"John Emrich v. Michael Ireland. 1. Ejectment. Damages at common law. Since the action of ejectment was adopted as a mode of trying title to real estate, it is well settled, as a rule of common law, that the jury, in the assessment of damages, are confined to a compensation for the injury sustained by the ejectment, which, being fictitious, the damages can only be nominal. 2. Same. The action originally. Mesne profits, how recovered, since its adoption to try title. The action of ejectment was originally a remedy for a tenant who had been, ejected, and he recovered his term and damages for the time he had been kept out of possession, which included the profits of the land. But when the action lost its primary characteristic, and was adopted merely .to try title, that which originally was a reality — the lease, entry, and ouster — was retained as mere fictions, and mesne profits were recovered in a subsequent action. 3. Same. Mesne profits under the code of 1871, section 1557. Under the Code of 1871, section 1557, it is optional with the plaintiff to demand and recover the mesne profits in his action of ejectment, or he may pretermit them and recover them, in a subsequent action, after the recovery in ejectment. 4. Same. Damages for waste, at common law. At common law, damages for waste could be recovered in an.action for mesne profits, if specifically counted for and demanded in the declaration. Qucere: Can damages for waste apd for injuries to the freeholder be recovered in an ejectment suit, under Code of 1871, section 1557? 5. Trespass quare clausum eregit. Who may maintain the action. The general rule is that only the party in possession can maintain the action of trespass quare clausum fregit. But, after the disseizee regains possession, he . can maintain his action against the disseizor for acts intermediate the disseizin and reentry. 6. Fixtures. Fences are. It is well settled that fencing is a fixture, and part of the freehold. 7.- Purchaser Bona Fide. Who is. A purchaser of land who does not entertain the honest belief that he is the true owner cannot assume the merit of being a purchaser in good faith, and is responsible in damages for the removal of fixtures which he himself placed on the land.

Davis purchased the lot at a tax 'sale, and, as he thought, got the tax-collector’.s deed for the same, and, in August 1875, sold and conveyed to John Emrich the said lot, following the description contained in the tax-collector’s deed. This description, as it turned out, called for a wholly different lot, and did not embrace any portion of Ireland’s lot. In March, 1876, Ireland brought an action of ejectment in the Circuit Court of Marshall County, against John Emrich, to recover the possession of said lot, claiming in his declaration only nominal damages, according to the form laid down in the Revised Code of 1871. The defendant, in his plea, denied possession, and admitted the plaintiff’s title, and thereupon a judgment was rendered for the possession of the lot, in plaintiff’s favor, without damages. At the time that the defendant, as he thought, purchased the lot and took possession thereof, the only improvement upon it consisted of a double log-cabin, worth, according to the testimony, some $25 to $75. The defendant, shortly after his supposed purchase, placed a common rail-fence around the lot. In March, 1876, whilst the action of ejectment was pending, the defendant’s son, then a member of defendant’s family, removed from the lot and placed upon defendant’s land the log-house and fence. The proof went to show that the hauling was done with the defendant’s team, and at a time when the son was in defendant’s service, or acting as his agent. The present action was brought by the plaintiff, shortly after the termination of the ejectment suit, to recover damages for injury to the freehold occasioned by the removal of said house and fence. The following charge, amongst others, • was given for the plaintiff below : “ 2. If the jury believe from the evidence that whilst John Emrich, Jr., was removing the house from the lot of Ireland, without his knowledge, he was acting as the agent and under the authority of his father, John Emrich, Sr., then such removal was the- act of John Emrich, Sr., and he is liable therefor, if such removal took place after the action in ejectment, and they must find the value-of said house for the plaintiff.” The giving. of this charge is assigned as error by plaintiff in error. The court below refused to give the following charges asked by the plaintiff in error. “3. If the jury believe from the evidence that John Emrich, the defendant, had color of title to the lot, and in good faith put the only fence on the lot that was on fit, and that the same was a valuable, and not an-ornamental, improvement, the plaintiff in this action cannot recover the value of .such fence.” “4. If the jury believe from the evidence that plaintiff brought his action of ejectment, and claimed damages in said action, and that the judgment of the court in said suit was for the possession of the lot, without damages, then plaintiff cannot recover in this case, if the jury believe from the evidence that the damages sued for in this case occurred before said judgment was rendered.” “ 5. Under the proof introduced by the plaintiff in this case as to the action of ejectment, plaintiff cannot recover for any damages done by defendant before the 31st March, 1876.” The action of the court in refusing these charges is assigned for error by the plaintiff in error. Walter & Walter, for the plaintiff in error. 1. Under the common-law rule the action of ejectment was strictly a fictitious action, settling merely the right of posses-, sion, and sounding only in nominal damages; an action for damages being an action in personam, and not in rem, the judgment for damages would necessarily be nominal as against an imaginary person. The tendency of our law-makers has been to do away with all of the forms and fictions that incumbered this action. Acts 1846; Acts 1850; Code 1857. The' legislation of 1846 and 1850 was received with disfavor by the courts, as in Davis v. Doe ex dem. Delpit, 25 Miss. 445 ; and it was not until the legislation of 1857, after all the fictions had been abolished, and after it had been twice enacted by statute, that the court held, in Garner v. Jones, 34 Miss. 505, that mesne profits and damages could be sued for and obtained in an action of ejectment. Since Garner v. Jones, supra, it has been the uniform tendency of this court to give more scope to the remedy afforded by ejectment. Nixon et al. v. Porter et al., 38 Miss. 401; Learned v. Gorbey, 43 Miss. 687. Plaintiff in the court below introduced in evidence a trans cript of the record of an action in ejectment against plaintiff in error, in which he had sued for damages, and had recovered judgment on March 31, 1876. 2. Defendant in error had the right to sue for damages in his action of ejectment. Garner v. Jones, 34 Miss. 505 ; JSTixon et al. v. Porter et al., 38 Miss. 401; Learned v. •Corbey, 43 Miss.' 687 ; White, Admr., et al. v. Tucker, 52 Miss. 145 ; Cole v. Johnson, 53 Miss. 94 ; Gaines v. Kennedy, 53 Miss. 103; Rev. Code 1871, sec. 1557; 4 Cal. 291; 3 Wall. 478; 18 B. Mon. 541; 8 Minn. 254; 12 Barb. 481; 23 How. Pr. 247; 4 Dali. 138; 13 Ired. 439; 4 Wheat. 230. In Alsop v. Peek, 2 Root, 234, it was held that the jury might assess damages in ejectment, not only for the rents and profits, but for waste committed on the premises. The damages sued for occurred prior to the rendition of the judgment in the ejectment suit. Defendant in error could not declare for damages in his ejectment suit and then bring a separate action for the same relief. u Rev. Code, secs. 1547, 1557 ; Learned v. Corbey, supra. In Gaines v. Kennedy, 53 Miss. 103, it was held that an adjudication in ejectment “ covers, not only all that was proved in the issue, but all that might have been established,” putting the action of ejectment upon the same footing with any other action at law. All rights of action accruing prior to the judgment in ejectment were res adjudicata, and, in consequence, the court erred in granting plaintiff’s second instruction, and in refusing defendant’s fourth and fifth instructions. In the action of ejectment, defendant in error did not sue for nominal damages, as in Form No. 1, Revised Code of 1871, section 1547, first part, but for actual damages ; and the judgment in ejectment was “ that plaintiff recover possession of the property in plaintiff’s declaration mentioned, without damages. Clearly, defendant in. 'error is es-topped from bringing any action for damages. White, Admr.f et al. v. Tucker, 52 Miss. 147. 3. Plaintiff in error asked the court to instruct the jury as follows: “If the jury believe from the evidence that John Emrich, the defendant, had color of title to the lot, and in good faith put the only fence on the lot that was on it, and that the same was not an ornamental improvement, then plaintiff in this action cannot recover the value of such fence.” Which charge the court refused to give, and erred in so refusing. The charge falls literally within the provisions of section 1557 of the Eevised Code of 1871, as amended by the act of February 22, 1872 (Pamphlet Acts 1872, p. 25). dole v. Johnson, 53 Miss. 94, citing Learned v. Corbey, 43 Miss. 687. As to what constitutes color of title, see Cole v. Johnson, supra, 99-101, citing Greeny. Biddle, 8 Wheat. 1, and on this point overruling Learned v. Corbey, supra. 4. Did the jury, under the facts in the case, have the right to find for exemplary damages ? In the court below the testimony was very conflicting as to the value of the property removed from the lot in controversy, it, however, being estimated as worth greatly less than the verdict rendered for damages. There is a broad distinction between the measure of damages for trespass in personam and trespass in rem. The former is much more stringent than the latter — exemplary damages' being given by way of punishment, and to operate by way of example. Bell v. Morrison, 5 Cushm. 68 ; New Orleans, St. Louis & Chicago R. R. Co. v. Burke, 53 Miss. 202. In actions for damages, where the taking is unaccompanied by fraud, malice, oppression, or willful wrong, this court has held the measure of damages to be the value of the property at the time of the taking, with interest to the time of the trial ;• ■ and this is a rule of law for the court, about which the jury have no discretion. Whitfield v. Whitfield, 40 Miss. 352; Briscoe v. McElween, 43 Miss. 556 ; Jamison v. Moon, 43 Miss. 598. In Stormy. Green, 50Miss. 103,it was held that, “ when willfulness, fraud, malice, or oppression, evincing a disregard of the rights of others, characterized the wrongful act complained of, the jury are not limited to the mere-value of the property and interest,” but may assess exemplary damages “¡is a punishment to the willful trespasser.” The factsin the case at bar are the reverse of those “ evincing a disregard of the rights of others.” Same principle as in 8 Ired. 236 ; 1 E. D. Smith, 196; 20 111. 37; 23 Cal. 306 ; Loleer v. Damon, 17 Pick. 284. In actions of tort for the destruction of property, its value furnishes the measure of damages, from which, if the jury materially depart, the court will order a new trial. Bailey v. Jeffords, 2 Spears, 27T; Whiibeck v. New York etc., R. R. Co., 50 Barb. 612; Harvey v. Sides, etc., Co. 1 Nev. 539. 5. Part of the property was removed by the son of plaintiff in error, and without his sanction, dr authority. Full knowledge on the part of the principal must be shown, in order to make a receipt of the fruits of an unauthorized act of an agent a ratification. Watson & Smith, for the defendant in error'. 1. The second charge asked by plaintiff in error, on thé trial was properly refused for two reasons : First, the proof in the case excluded the idea that the plaintiff in error had “ color of title” to said lot, or put the fence around it in good faith; hence the charge was not applicable to the facts. Charges must be applicable to the facts as proven. O’Reilly v. Hendricks, 2 Smed. & M. 299 ; Wright, v. Clark, 5 Ga. 116; Fairly v. Fairly, 9 Ga.. 280. Second, even admitting that the plaintiff in error had color pf title to said lot, and in good faith put the fence around it, he had no right to remove the fence and convert it to his own use whilst the action of ejectment was pending. When the fence was'erected, it became as much a part of the freehold as the soil itself, and, the plaintiff in error having failed iii the ejectment suit to claim compensation for improvements, the legal presumption is that the mesne profits fully compensated him. The right of a party who has made improvements under color of title, and in good faith, to claim compensation therefor against the rightful owner certainly does not justify him in.tearing down and removing these' improvements whilst the action of ejectment is pending ; and if he does this, he is undoubtedly liable for damages to the true owner. It cannot be questioned that the fence became, by the act of building-, a part of the freehold. Wentz v. Fencher, 12 Ired. 297; 1 Washb. on Beal Prop., 3d ed., 115, sec. 4. 2. The fourth charge asked by plaintiff in error proceeds upon the theory that the rights of the defendant in error, as to damages, were finally settled in the action of ejectment, and that, no damages having been awarded him, the whole matter is now res adjudícala. This view of the case is manifestly erroneous. In all actions of ejectment, even where mesne profits are claimed, the damages are .merely nominal; and nothing more in the -way of damages could have been assessed by the jury. Davis v. Doe, ex dem. Delpit, 25 Miss. 447, 448. At common law the action of ejectment was brought to recover damages for the-alleged ouster only; now, the object of the action is to recover the term, and not damages. 3 Bac. Abr. 436, title “ Ejectment,” H. For damages done to the freehold, a separate suit-must be brought.. Facquette v. Ficlcness, 19 Wis. 325. Such being the well-established law of the'case, the fourth instruction asked by plaintiff' in error was properly refused. 3. The refusal of the court to give the fifth charge asked by the plaintiff in error was strictly in accordance with the law of the case as laid down in the foregoing authorities, and, hence, not error. The fifth charge embodies, in a slightly changed form, the doctrine contained in the fourth charge, which we have-shown was rightly refused. Plaintiff in error claimed to be in possession under a deed worthless on account of misdescription ; and, therefore, his possession was tortious Cole v. Johnson, 53 Miss. 100; Sign v. Frye, 62 111. 507 ; Wright v. Mattison, 18 How. 56. And it is claimed that he, having put the fence around the lot, could remove it. This position is erroneous. Where one builds with an evil intent, with his own timber, on another’s soil, it becomes the owner’s of the soil. Stillman v. Hamer, 7 How. 425 ; Gray v. Oylee, 2 Bush, 261. And if such buildings are removed by the party placing them there, he is liable to the owner of the soil for their value. Sheebschaum v. McHenry, 29 Wis. 655. In our declaration in ejectment we demanded the land and the appurtenances, and the judgment was for the property described in the declaration ; and, hence, their removal was tortious. A plaintiff in ejectment is as much entitled to recover the improvements as the land. McMinn v. Mayes, 4 Cal. 209. All things- attached to the realty which are necessary to its full and free enjoyment, are fixtures. English v. Foster, 8 Smed. & M. 451; Pottery. Oromwell, 40 N. Y. 295; Bucleley v. Buckley, 4 Barb. 45 ; Farris v. Walker, 1 Bailey, 540 ; Gh-een v. Phillips, 26 Gratt. 752. Fences are necessary for the full and free enjoyment of the freehold, and are fixtures. Mitchell v. Billingsly, 17 Ala. 393 ; Gliddeny. Bennett, 43 N. H. 306 ; Wentz v. Fincher, 12 Ired.; Smith v. Oarroll, 4 Greene (Iowa), 146 ; Gibson v. Vaughn, 2 Bailey, 389 ; Voorhees v. McGinnis, 48 N. Y. 282 ; Gaper v. Peckham, 35 Conn. 88. The defendant in error haying the right of property and of. immediate possession, he can' maintain the action of trespass, though not in actual possession. Dejarnett v. Haynes, 23 Miss. 600 ; Mason v. Leiois, 1 Iowa, 494. 4. The court did err in giving the second charge for defendant in error. The proof was ample that John Emrich, Jr., was in the habit of acting as his father’s agent. This being a question of fact for the jury, they decided he was. John Emrich, Sr:, received’the benefit of his son’s .acts with full knowledge of all the facts, and the law, under these circumstances, would make him an agent, and his principal liable. 53. Miss. 238'; Story on Ag., secs. 89, 242, 244. The mere fact that the agent was a trespasser does not excuse the principal. 6 Ga. 391. Plaintiff in error has had two fair trials, and both times judgment has been rendered against him. The case is one mostly of facts, and this court will not reverse or disturb the judgment when the successful party, upon the whole, was entitled to recover. 53 Miss., 200, 307; 52 Miss. 547. The question for this court to determine in considering whether the verdict of a jury is sustained by the evidence is, not whether the verdict is clearly right, but is it manifestly wrong.

       "  'case_summary': \"HUBBARD et al., Appellants, v. SWOFFORD BROTHERS DRY GOODS COMPANY. Division One, February 26, 1908. 1. DEED: By Agent: Purpose. A deed “by and between J. W. Summers, as agent for Chester Hubbard and Mary Hubbard, his wife, of the county of Jackson and State of Missouri, of the first •part,” reciting that “the said party of the first part, for his heirs, executors and administrators, covenant and agree with said party of the second part... .In testimony wheieof the said J. W. Summers, as agent for Chester Hubbard and Mary Hubbard, his wife, of the first part, has hereunto,” etc., and signed by “J. W. Summers, Atty. for Chester Hubbard,” not only purports to be the deed of Hubbard and wife, but one would have to yield his common sense interpretation of it to a very narrow technical one to reach the conclusion that it was the personal deed of Summers. Although Hubbard and wife lived in Iowa and Summers in Jackson county, yet as Hubbard had lately prior thereto executed a power of attorney to Summers conferring on him plenary power to sell any and all real estate in Jackson county belonging to Hubbard, and the land belonged to Hubbard, and the 'grantee accepted the deed as convéying the title to him, its evidént intention was to convey Hubbard’s title. 2. -: Seal: No Scroll. Where no seal appears in the record copy, but the closing .clause of the deed declares it is under seal of the grantor and the acknowledgment is .that it was duly executed, the law presumes the deed was sealed. 3. -: -: By Agent. Where the deed manifests the. maker’s intention to act as attorney for his principals in making the deed, and not for himself, the seal attached by him was their seal. 4. -: Acknowledgment: Before “Mayor of Kansas.” By an acknowledgment in Jackson county before “the mayor of Kansas in said county” is meant an acknowledgment before the mayor of “the City of Kansas,” the official name of a city at that time (1856) in Jackson county. No one could be mistaken as to the municipality referred to. 5. -: -: Officer's Seal. Where the deed recites that it was given under the official seal of the officer taking the acknowledgment, it, will be presumed that the omission of the “(L. S.)” in the certified copy was the mistake or oversight of the recorder making the copy. 6. LIMITATIONS: Adverse Possession: Break in Continuity: 1 Remaindermen. The property was sold in 1856, and the grantee built a three-story brick house thereon, and inclosed the lot with a close fence, and lived in it until the fall of 1863, and then placed a tenant in it, and sold it in January, 1864, and that grantee testified it was vacant when he bought it. Held, that even if the original deed made in 1856 was insufficient to convey title, the continuity of the adverse possession was not broken by the fact that, for a short time, in 1863, less than three months., the property was not occupied, and as the original grantee did not die until 1861, the Statute of Limitations began to run against him in his lifetime, and his remaindermen cannot claim that it did not begin to run against them until the death of their mother, who died in 1899 — the original owner leaving a will by which he gave all his property to his wife for life, remander to his children, the plaintiffs. Appeal from Cass Circuit Court. — Eon, W. L. Jarrott, Judge. Affirmed. English & English for appellants. (1) The deed should not have been admitted in evidence at all. It was a copy of the record. The proof of the inability to produce the original was insufficient. The record constituted no evidence because the acknowledgment was not authenticated under the seal of the City of Kansas. Laws 1853, Approved Feb. 22, 1853, sec. 6, art. 3. (2) The deed was ineffective because it did not purport to be Hubbard’s deed at all and did not purport to be sealed with Hubbard’s seal. The deed would be wholly void at common law as Hubbard’s deed. Story on Agency, 147; 2 Kent, -631. Thie statute authorizing the use of a scroll as a seal (R. S. 1889, sec, 2388), which had been in force long before the deed in question was dated, recognized the fact that private parties usually used the scroll, and required the instrument, when the scroll was used, to recite that it was under seal. When this recital is made, it will he presumed that the original was sealed even though the copy shows no seal. In this case the record shows no seal. The instrument recites that Summers’ seal was affixed, but it contains no recital that Hubbard’s seal was affixed nor does the copy purport to show Hubbard’s seal.

(1) The failure of the mayor of Kansas City to insert in his certificate of acknowledgment the words .“the City of” before the word “Kansas,” was a mere clerical omission. This is made perfectly clear by the other recitals in the certificate. The certificate recites that it was given tinder the mayor’s hand and official seal, and the presumption is that the official seal'1 was affixed, although the (L. S.) does not appear on the certified copy of the deed. Jones'on Eeal Property, sec. 1075; 25 Am. and Eng. Ency. Law, 78 ; Hammond v. Cordon, 93 Mr. 223; McCoy v. Cassidy, 96 Mo. 429; Macey v.

(3) There can be no question but that it was the intention of Summers, in executing this deed, to act for Hubbard, and not for himself.

The deed introduced does not purport to be under Hubbard’s seal, nor does the certified copy of the record recite that it was under his seal. The only recital of the record is that it was under Summers’ seal. Since it did not purport to be under Hubbard’s seal, the deed could not be read in evidence. Walker v. Kirk, 8 Mo. 301; McCoy v.

Kailroad Corporation—Killing of Cattle by Trains—Maintenance of Fences—Lack of Negligence.—In an action against a railroad company for damages for the loss of cattle killed by its trains, the evidence is insufficient to show negligence on the part of defendant in the matter of its duty, under section 485 of the Civil 'Code, to maintain fences along its right of way, where the cattle were all killed at a place where the country was composed of sand, which shifted and changed into banks and dunes at different points with the blowing of the winds, and the fences were frequently buried by dunes permitting the passage of cattle upon the tracks. Id.—Exercise of Keasonable Diligence.—A railroad company is bound to use reasonable diligence in keeping its right of way fences in repair, and it need not resort to extraordinary means, such as the maintenance of a special patrol, to insure that its fences will not be broken or that they are promptly repaired, if broken. Id.—Death of Suckling Calf—Liability of Railroad Company.— In an, action against a railroad company for the loss of a cow and her suckling calf, the defendant is liable for the death of the calf where the death of the cow resulted from the negligence of the company and the death of the calf from starvation following the loss of its mother. Id.—Maintenance of Fences—Duty of Bailroad Company.—It is incumbent upon a railroad corporation, by virtue of section 485 of the Civil Code, to maintain good and sufficient fences on both sides of its track and property, and there is no duty imposed upon adjoining land owners where the country is composed of sand, which shifts and changes into banks and dunes with the blowing of the winds, to erect windbreaks or other obstructions to prevent the sand from drifting and covering such fences. Id.—Breaking of Gate and Fence—Killing of Cattle—Liability of Company.—A railroad company is not liable for the loss of cattle killed by one of its trains where the animals entered upon the defendant’s right of way through a break in its fence caused by the throwing down of a gate and a part of the fence, in the absence of evidence that the gate or fence was defective or unfitted to meet ordinary conditions.

A written agreement by the grantor of the right-of-way to a railroad company, to fence it on each side through his lands, will not affect the right of a subsequent purchaser to require the company to fence its road, under the provisions of Sections 3324 and 3325, Revised Statutes, where ■ the purchase was made without actual or constructive notice of the existence of such agreement. 2. Such agreement not being recorded, the mere use and occupation of the right-of-way by the company and its successors for the purpose of a railroad, will not constitute constructive notice of the existence of such agreement. (Decided November 13, 1888.) Error to the Circuit Court of Clinton County. In the original action the plaintiff sought to recover of the-defendant $570.00 as the reasonable cost of building a fence on each side of its right-of-way through his lands, under the provisions of sections 3324 and 3325 of the Revised Statutes, imposing the duty on railroad companies of fencing their roads, and giving the abutting owner the right to build the ffences- and to recover the reasonable cost of the company, where it. fails to do so. The defendant answered, relying on an agreement by which one A. W. Miller, who in 1852 granted the right-of-way to its-predecessor, bound himself to keep up and maintain the fences-on the line through his lands, and from whom the plaintiff by intermediate conveyance, derives his title. A demurrer to this having been overruled, the plaintiff replied denying the existence of the agreement, or any knowledge of it- at the time he purchased. The ease was submitted to the court on an agreed statement, of the facts, which is as follows: “agreed statement oe facts. “ The parties to this action agree that the following statement contains and shall constitute the facts therein : “ 1. That the facts stated in the petition are true. “ 2. That the plaintiff derived his title to the lands described in the petition through, by, and under Andrew Miller. “ 3. That on the 17th day of June, A. D. 1852, the said Andrew Miller was the owner of said lands, and on that day executed and delivered to the Cincinnati, Wilmington & ZanesvilleRailroad Company a certain paper writing, in the words and figures as set forth in a copy thereof hereto attached, marked exhibit “ A,” and made a part of this agreed state of facts, and under, and by virtue of which said company entered upon said lands and built its road through the same. “ 4. That the railroad stock specified in said paper writing was delivered to said Andrew Miller, and said crossing and cattle-guards built as in said paper writing required. “ 5. That said paper writing was on the 21st day of January, A. D. 1884, recorded in the office of the Recorder of Clin ton county, Ohio, and after the commencement of this action, and at no other time. “ 6. That the plain tiff had no actual notice of the existence or contents of said paper writing, his only notice being the use and occupation of the roadway through said lands by the defendants and the several companies through and under which it claims as stated in its answer. “ 7. That the defendant occupies and possesses said railroad by virtue of a lease thereof from the Cincinnati & Muskingum Valley Railway Company for the term of ninety-nine years, not yet expired. That said Cincinnati & Muskingum Valley Railway acquired the title to said railroad and all interests and property connected therewith, including rights of way, by means of certain mortgages and judicial sales thereof, thereunder, and at and from the said Cincinnati, Wilmington & . Zanesville Railway Company as fully as such proceedings could transfer them, and the said Cincinnati, Wilmington & Zanesville Railway Company has long since ceased to exist as a corporation. “ The above agreed statement of facts is submitted to the court as containing all the facts in the case to be entered of record as such, and upon which the court is asked to pronounce the law alone. “ EXHIBIT ‘A.’ “ State of Ohio, Clinton County. “ In consideration of one dollar to me paid by the Cincinnati, Wilmington & Zanesville Railroad Company, I do hereby grant and release to said company the right to enter upon any lands I own, which lie on the line of said company’s road, surveyed and adopted by (hem, (or intended to be surveyed or adopted by them) and the right to run in curves and amend the line on the final construction of such railroad over said land, and to hold and use a strip thereof to be selected by the engineers, not exceeding 100 feet in width, for the purpose of a railroad so long as may be necessary, and to use the material standing or lying on said strip for the construction and repair of said road. I also agree to build and sustain all fences on. each side of said roadway, and to pay all taxes on said land during the occupancy by said company of the same ; and also the right of crossing other parts of my land to get at said railroad in construction and repair of said road. I will require said company to construct a farm crossing at the nearest surface grade, or within two feet thereof where I select; also a cattle guard on either side, and I hereby demand for said privilege four hundred and fifty dollars to be paid in stock of said company. » “Witness my hand and seal the seventeenth day of June, A.

The word “ plea ” should have been used instead of “ pretense ”; and because the true doctrine is that although the slayer provoked the combat, or produced the occasion, yet, if be done without any felonious intent, intending, for instance, merely an ordinary battery, or trespass, the accused may avail himself of the plea of self-defence. 4.

But if the fence had been built by the accused on his own land, such removal would not be a tortious act at all. And in either event, if, to prevent such removal, deceased had made an attack upon accused with a deadly weapon, under circumstances calculated to excite in the latter’s mind a reasonable apprehension of death or great bodily injury to himself, under which he kills his assailant, he would be entitled to avail himself of the plea of self-defence. An instruction to the contrary ; Held : Erroneous. Error to judgment of circuit, court of Grayson county, rendered October 31, 1890, whereby the plaintiff in error, Columbus Hash, was sentenced to the penitentiary for six years, in accordance with the verdict of the jury found on an indictment charging him with the murder of Anderson Rutherford. On the 3d day of June, 1890, Columbus Hash and Rowan Hash were jointly indicted in the county court of Grayson county for the murder of Anderson Rutherford, in said county, and, on their arraignment in said county court, the prisoner, Columbus Hash, demanded to be tried in the circuit court of said county; whereupon he was remanded for trial in said court, and the proceedings had in said county court Avere duly certified to said circuit court. The prisoner, by his counsel, moATed the court to cpiash the indictment, but the court overruled the motion. At the trial the attorney for the commonwealth asked the court to give to the jury six instructions, the first, second, third, and fourth of Avhich Avere given without objection, but the court refused the fifth and sixth of the instructions, and gave in lieu thereof tAVO others, of its own motion, AA'hich in the record are designated by corresponding numbers; to the giving of which two instructions the prisoner, by his counsel, excepted. And the prisoner, by his counsel, asked the court to give to the jury ten instructions, to the seventh and eighth of which the attorney for the commonwealth objected, which objection the court sAAst-ained, and refused to give said seventh and eighth instructions, but gave all the others, so asked for by the prisoner; and to the action of the court refusing said seventh and eighth instructions the prisoner, by his counsel, also excepted. All the instructions asked for on both -sides, as well as those given by the court in lieu of instructions live and six, asked for by the attorney for the commonwealth, and instructions seven and eight, asked for by the prisoner, and refused by the court, are set forth in the one bill of exceptions taken by the prisoner to the rulings of the court objected to ; and in the same bill of exceptions the court certifies all the evidence adduced at the trial. . The jury returned the following verdict: “’We, the jury, find-the accused, Columbus Hash, guilty of murder in the second degree, and fix his confinement in the state penitentiary for a term of six years.” And thereupon the prisoner, by his counsel, moved the court to set aside the verdict and grant him a new trial, upon the ground that the same ivas contrary to the law and the evidence, and for other causes, but the court overruled the motion, and refused to set aside the verdict and grant a new trial, and thereupon proceeded to pronounce sentence upon the accused in accordance with the verdict of the jury; and to such ruling and judgment the prisoner, by his counsel, also excepted, and on application obtained from one of the judges of this court a writ of error and supersedeas to said judgment.

Adjoining the track on the south side of the station, and separated from it only by a fence, was a parkway, the property of the railroad company, which for many years was used with the company’s permission by those going to and from the station in wagons and other conveyances, and the company had opened the fence and built and maintained a passageway from the parkway to the station platform, over which passengers passed from their vehicles to take trains on either track. Held, that the permission or invitation, to persons going to the station to take a train on the north track,\" to cross the south track ■from such parkway, placed upon the railroad company the duty to protect the plaintiff against the peculiar hazards of that way, as they might be increased or diminished by the movement of trains across it, and the measure of care and protection which they had a right to expect was not affected by the fact that other ways of reaching the station were provided, not requiring the crossing of the track on the company’s premises. |Ed.

While the filing of a plot, showing streets thereon, constitutes a dedication to the public, the filing of a plot of land on the seashore, showing the location of the ocean, does not amount to a dedication of the beach. Verbal declarations of a dedicator, made contemporaneously with the dedication, are admissible in evidence to show the scope, where such declarations are against interest and a part of the res gestae. Where the directors of a company orally declared, when selling lots from a plot of lands fronting on the ocean, that no buildings should be placed between certain lots on the ocean, and none were maintained there for over twenty years, such declaration was sufficient to show a dedication to the public. Where the directors of a corporation engaged in selling its lots informed the purchasers that the space between the ocean and a certain street should be open, the authority of the directors to make such declarations cannot be questioned in a proceeding to secure a preliminary injunction to restrain the obstruction of such space. While acceptance is a necessary element of dedication, an acceptance by the public will be presumed, where the dedication is beneficial to the public and imposes no burden; and such presumption will be exercised, where land between a street and the ocean was dedicated to public use. Where the land between a street and the ocean was dedicated to public use, and it was provided that no buildings should be erected thereon, the erection of a bathhouse and a fence on the shore line was an obstruction of the right of a person who had bought a lot upon the street upon faith in the dedication. Where the land between a street and the ocean was dedicated as a space that should ever be open and unobstructed to the view of the ocean of those persons living on and using the street, the right of such persons was not lost because the ocean washed away the land up to the street line. Property dedicated to the public for one purpose cannot be used for another public purpose inconsistent with the dedication, or which interfered with the original purpose. Where the charter of a municipality granted by the General Assembly authorized the town to grant franchises to erect wharves and piers on the beach, the town had no authority to permit the erection of a bathhouse on the beach which had been dedicated to the public use. Where a property owner was injured by the erection of a bathhouse on the ocean beach, which had been dedicated to the public, he could enjoin such erection, though an indictment would lie to prevent the encroachment, and though upon conviction of an encroachment the Court might order a removal, and though it was the duty of the municipality to prevent encroachment. Where an owner of land had the right to a view across land which had been dedicated to the public to be kept open, he was entitled to enjoin an obstruction of this view; there being an injury peculiar to him and different from that to the general public. Where the land between the ocean and the street upon which complainant’s property abutted had been dedicated to the public, to be kept, open and uninclosed, the complainant could enjoin the erecction of buildings upon the land which would cut off his view of the ocean; such erection causing him pecuniary damage by decreasing the value of his property. Where a bathhouse had already been built upon a beach dedicated to the public, a mandatory injunction will not be issued to enforce its removal, on rule to show cause for a preliminary injunction to restrain its erection and maintenance. Injunction Bill. The Rehoboth Beach Camp Meeting Association of the Methodist Episcopal Church was mcorporated by special act of the Legislature of Delaware in 1873 and became the owner of a large tract of land along the Atlantic Ocean in Lewes and Rehoboth Hundred, and the land was plotted and laid out in building lots. In the plot certain avenues, streets and highways were dedicated to the use of the public. Among the avenues so dedicated was one known as Surf Avenue, which extends along the ocean front and parallel thereto, and Baltimore Avenue, which leads into Surf Avenue at right angles thereto, and the space between Surf Avenue and the ocean, it is claimed, was also dedicated to the public as a space that should be ever open and unobstructed to the view of the ocean by persons living on and using said avenues. The bill alleged that the complainant was the owner of a lot at the corner of Surf Avenue and Baltimore Avenue, on which a dwelling house was erected in 1878, and since that time said house has been used as a residence during the summer months; that he was entitled to and possessed of an easement in the right to the free and unobstructed use of the whole of said avenues, as well as the right to an unobstructed view of the ocean from his dwelling house, and also to use all that portion of the shore between Surf Avenue and the ocean for the purposes to which it was dedicated. The Commissioners of Rehoboth, one of the defendants, had control of and sujeervision over the said avenues, streets and highways, and in January, 1911, leased a part of Surf Avenue and the shore at the foot of Baltimore Avenue to Charles P. Hill for the purpose of erecting thereon bath houses. The bill further alleged that under the terms of said lease the said Charles P. Hill was permitted to build a board fence, inclosing the bath houses on three sides, to such a height as to obstruct the complainant’s view of the ocean and to prevent his use of the whole of Surf Avenue and the shore for the purposes for which they were dedicated. At the time of the filing of the bill the bath houses and fence were being constructed under the direction of Edward Hill, an agent or servant of the said Charles P. Hill, and further work thereon was restrained • and a rule issued requiring the said Commissioners of Rehoboth, Charles P. Hill and Edward Hill to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not be granted restraining them from obstructing and interfering with the right of way, view and easement of the complainant. At the return of the rule the cause was heard on bill, affidavits and exhibits. Daniel- 0. Hastings, for the complainant. Willard Saulsbury and Albert F. Polk, for the defendants.',\n",

From Marion: William Galloway, Judge. Statement by Mr. Chief Justice Eakin. The controversy in- this case arises in a proceeding by J. G.

There is but little contorversy as to the principal facts, namely: That in March, 1885, the defendant made a homestead entry upon the southwest quarter of section 28, township 7 south, range 1 east, Willamette meridian, and at that time commenced making his improvements, which, by mistake as to the location of the west line of the homestead, he placed upon a portion of the 10.3-acre tract in controversy, and inclosed the same with a fence, and has occupied the portion so inclosed since said time until the year 1909, claiming it as a part of his homestead; that in May, 1909, the defendant sold his homestead to the applicant, Lais, in this proceeding. Findings were made and decree rendered by the circuit court in favor of plaintiff upon the ground that the defendant’s holding was not adverse, and defendant appeals. Affirmed. For appellant there was a brief over the names of Mr. John H. McNary, Mr. Charles L. McNary, and Mr. Walter L. Spaulding, with an oral argument by Mr. Spaulding. For respondent there was a brief over the names of Messrs. Rauch & Seitz, with an oral argument by Mr. Maurice W. Seitz.',\n",

In trespass to try title, evidence held sufficient to support the jury’s finding of adverse possession of defendant’s predecessor, 2. Appeal and error <§=>1002 — Jury’s verdict on conflicting testimony cannot be disturbed on appeal. In trespass to try title, where the evidence as to when land was fenced, and whether the fences were continuously kept up by a land company, so as to exclude the stock of others, was conflicting, the matter was for the jury, and their finding cannot be disturbed on appeal. 3. Evidence <⅝=14, 588 — Witness’ statement that he built fence within three years after a party took possession is not destroyed by inability to remember the year. The inability accurately to remember dates, and hesitancy under cross-examination, especially with illiterate witnesses, to name the exact' date of a past occurrence, is a matter of common knowledge, and a witness’ statement that he built a fence inclosing the land in controversy within three years after a certain party took possession of it is not destroyed by a witness’ further statement that he cannot remember the year. 4. Adverse possession <§=>l 14(1) — Evidence held to sustain findings for defendant on issue of adverse possession of his predecessor in title. In an action in trespass to try title, evidence held to sustain finding in favor of the defendant on the issue of limitation of 10 years accruing under the possession of one of his predecessors in title and the executors of such predecessor while acting as defendant’s agents and tenants at will. 5. Adverse possession <§=>25 — Express contract of lease or rental is not essential to holding of adverse possession by one person for another. An express contract of lease or rental is not essential to the holding of possession by one person for another, and, if one who has entered land including a parcel claimed by another recognizes and acknowledges claimant’s title, and there is an understanding between them as to the use thereof, and claimant thereafter permits or suffers the occupant and those succeeding to his estate to occupy the parcel, they are estopped to deny claimant’s title in an action in trespass to try title. 6. Adverse possession <§=>89 — Finding on issue of five years’ limitation cannot be sustained in the absence of sufficient evidence of payment of taxes. In trespass to try title, jury’s finding in favor of the defendant upon the issue of five years’ limitation accruing under certain of defendant’s predecessors in title cannot be sustained where there is insufficient evidence of the payment of taxes by the defendant or his predecessors during such occupancy. , Appeal from District Court, Brazoria County; M.

Railboads (§ 103 ) — Fences — Statutory Provisions — “Field.” The word “field,” in Rev. Civ. St. 1911, arts. 6595-6598, requiring every railroad company whose road passes through a “field” to place and maintain cattle guards at the points -of entry, etc., means land inclosed by a fence which will prevent the ingress of live stock, and a railroad company need not provide cattle guards unless its track passes through an undivided field inclosed by the owner, as distinguished from separate fields so inclosed.

Where a railroad company maintaining a track through a plantation fenced its right of way, and constructed cattle guards at the points of entry, and the owner subsequently inclosed the land and joined his fences to the right of way fences without intending to subdivide his land into separate fields, the track passed through a field within Rev. Civ. St. 1911, arts. 6595-6598. [Ed. Note. — For other cases, see Railroads, Cent. Dig. §§ 315-332, 762, 763, 767, 769, 772; Dec. Dig. § 103. ] 3. Damages (§ 62 ) — Injuries to Property-Mitigation. Where a railroad company failed to maintain proper cattle guards at points of entry into a field, the owner damaged by trespassing hogs passing over the cattle guards was not required to minimize damages by fixing the cattle guards and the right of way fence built by the company. [Ed. Note. — For other cases, see Damages, Cent. Dig. §§ 119-132; Dec. Dig. § 62. ] Appeal from District Court, Bowie County; P. A. Turner, Judge. Action by Luck Lee against the St. Louis Southwestern Railway Company of Texas. From a judgment for plaintiff, defendant appeals. Affirmed. Appellee owns a plantation of about 500 acres in Bowie county, which the appellant’s line of railroad enters on the east, running through in a southwesterly direction to the west side. The conclusion is reasonably warranted that appellee cleared and inclosed the land after the railway was built. Prior to the injury in suit, the railway company had erected a fence on its right of way, on both the east and the west side, entirely through ■the tract of land. Appellee’s fences around his land joined to the right of way fences. In addition to the right of way fences, the appellant had constructed cattle guards or .stops at the points where the railway enters the appellee’s farm on the east and west. 'There is evidence that the right of way fenc- ■ es were insufficient to prevent hogs from entering the appellee’s cultivated land, which was situated on each side of the right of way fences, if the hogs once entered the inclosed railway track at the cattle guards or stops on the east and west sides of the farm where the railway enters the same. It was established, without conflict of evidence, that hogs entered appellee’s inclosed farm by first getting over or through the cattle guards or stops on the east side, and then getting through the right of way fence into appel-lee’s growing crops, and destroyed a large amount of same. The suit, among other things, was to recover the value of the crops thus destroyed. It was alleged as ground for suit that appellant had neglected and failed to place, and keep same in good repair, good and sufficient cattle guards or stops at the points where its line of railroad entered ap-pellee’s inclosure, as required by law. The court charged the jury: “The evidence shows that the railroad of defendant enters the inclosure or field of plaintiff in two places, one on the east and one on the west. It was the duty of defendant to put in cattle guards where its railroad enters the field of plaintiff that would prevent stock of every kind from entering said field. If you believe from the evidence that hogs crossed either of said cattle guards and thereby entered the field pf plaintiff and injured or destroyed any of his corn or peas standing therein, and thereby damaged plaintiff, then you will find for plaintiff as to this item of damage.” Glass, Estes, King & Burford, of Texarka-na, and E.

Section. 1289 of the Code, providing that railway companies “ shall be liable for all damages by fire that is set out or caused by the operation” of their roads, does not create an absolute liablity, but makes the fact of an injury so occurring only prima fade evidence of negligence, which may be rebutted by proof of freedom from negligence. Argument 1. The statute provides that the manner of recovery shall be the same as for injury to stock, but in the latter case the company can escape liability by showing freedom from negiigence. Argument 2. Exposure to fire is a part of the injury for which . right-of-way damages are allowed, and it is presumed to be paid for when such damages are paid. Argument 3. Where a statute is of doubtful construction the public interest should be considered, and public interest would forbid the making of railway companies absolute insurers for all the property which may happen to be destroyed by fire set by the operation of their roads. Argument 4. At common law the doctrine prevailed in this State that contributory negligence would defeat a recovery for property destroyed by fire set by a railway company. Beck, Oh.

Burt sued Edmond Blackmon, May 9, 1889, for lot number 990 in tbe 20th. district \\'and 3d section of originally Cherokee, now Haralson county. She obtained a verdict for the premises, and defendant’s motion for a new trial, on the general grounds alone, was overruled. Plaintiff put in evidence the plat and grant from the State to Joseph McKee, dated June 15, 1850. Also-, certified copy of the will of Joseph McKee, with power therein to convey the land, and letters testamentary to, his wife Ann J. Also, deed from the executrix to plaintiff. Defendant introduced deed to himself from S. J. Car roll, dated January 12, 1881, and testified: I am in possession of the land. Took possession right after the purchase under this deed, in 1881. Tom Carroll was in possession when I bought, living on it in a little log house, and had between a half and three quarters of an acre cleared. I have cultivated that pretty well all the time fox three or four years, \\'and then puit a family of people in there and they stayed some three or four — I don’t know hardly how long, but I have had it in possession all the while, nearly all of it under fence, and since cleared more, some three or four or five acres cleared now on the place. I had under fence about the full lot. I suppose I bought the property like any other man would, because I wanted it, and I bought it in good faith rand thought I was getting a genuine title. I was buying from a man I thought would not handle anything else but good titles, Tom Carroll and his wife. The deed is from Tom Carroll and his wife. I never knew of her dealing in lands before that; hadn’t known her very long. I suppose Carroll had been dealing in lands. Think he signed the deed, but don’t say positively. Really don’t know for certain whether I bought from his wife. The house was near the center of the lot. I added a very little to the patch the next year. I cleared about three years later on. Nobody lived in the house in 1881, and I don’t think there was anybody in 1882 or 1883. I am not positive, but my recollection is Mr. \"Williams’ folks stayed there in 1881 and they lived there in 1885. I think they stayed there three years. I don’t know that any one was in it in 1887, but would not be positive of it. It never had been vacant until it rotted down. I have had some plunder on it, using it as a bam. \"Was using it as a bam in 1883. It is about a quarter from my house, and the lot joins my other lands. I don’t recollect any one living in the house in 1888. I had wheatstraw, fodder, etc., in it. Thé house.is not right on the road, but is in sight of the road. At the time the suit was filed, I reckon there were three acres in all cleared. It was in the southwest comer of the lot. I don’t know exactly what year I did clear it up; didn’t charge my mem017 with the date. I cleared about two acres in this year. Have had between three and five acres fenced in ever since I have been in possession of it, some of it right on the road and some not. The fence I ran right up on the road, but I don’t remember whether it was or was not since the suit was filed. All the fence was not there in 1889, but I think some was. The lot is now all in woods pasture. I have cultivated that ever since I cleared it, and put out that fence three years ago when the stock law came back. Bight at the house and the patch around the house was not in \\'any field. The field I spoke of clearing after that was over in the southwest comer of the lot; in the fall of 1885, is my recollection. I added to the other field; that took in the lot. The house is about 150 yards from the road. There is a wagon road goes out to it, which has been there ever since the house was put there. It is not a public road, and the other one is a church road and a mill, and the road goes down to the house like any other wagon road a man would have to go to his house. The church road goes through the northeast comer of the lot of land, but the patch in the southwest corner caniiot be seen from it, though it can be seen from another public road.

       "  'case_summary': 'The Sussex Trust Company, Executor of the Last Will and Testament of Joseph W. Marsh, Deceased, vs. Margaret E. Polite and Others. Sussex, Jan. 15, 1919. Declarations, whenever made by a testator as to his intentions in using certain words in his will, or as to a proper construction to be made of them are inadmissible in evidence. Evidence\\'is always admissible as to the state of the testator’s property, and his purpose in acquiring it, as distinct from evidence of his declarations as to the meaning, of the words of his will. The testator’s purpose in acquiring property may be shown by his declarations or acts. The intention of the testator must be drawn from the language of the will, viewed in the light which the situation and circumstances connected with the property may shed upon it. Where testator, after devising forty-five acres, sold part of it and acquired a new parcel contiguous thereto, and actually used it as part of the tract theretofore owned, so that the acreage was increased beyond forty-five acres, on the issue whether the enlarged tract passed under the devise, testimony was admissible of testator’s declarations as to his reasons for making the changes and as to the use made of the after-acquired land. The Delaware statute as to after-acquired land applies to general and not specific devises. In a will devising to one all that \\'parcel of land, situate in S. County, “where I now reside,” containing forty-five acres, more or less, the word “now” is not a limitation, but an item of description, and does not of itself exclude from the devise after-acquired property, annexed to and enlarging the devised tract. A devise of a described tract “on which I now reside” held to pass to the devisee a tract of thirty-three acres which was acquired after the making of the will by the testator for the purpose of adding it to the tract on which he resided, and which he did in fact annex thereto, by effecting a unity of possession and actual occupation. Bill By Executor for Instructions. Joseph W. Marsh by will dated January 19, 1916, directed his executor to sell all his property \"excepting, however, the lands and chattels hereinafter more particular devised or bequeathed,” made certain legacies, pecuniary and specific, and by the fifth item devised, as follows: “Fifth: I give and devise unto Margaret E. Polite, should she be living at the time of my death, all that certain tract, piece or parcel of land, situate in Sussex County, Delaware, where I now reside, lying on both sides of the county road leading from Millsboro to Lewes, adjoining lands of Joseph Moore, Erasmus W. W. Marsh and others, containing forty-five acres, more or less, for and during the term of her natural life, and at her death the said property to go to Dr. Joseph M. Martin, his heirs and assigns forever.\" The testator died March 1, 19-17, and letters testamentary were granted to the executor, the complainant. Both Margaret E. Polite and Dr. Joseph M. Martin survived the testator. At the time the will was made the testator owned and resided on a tract of land described as sét forth in the will, and containing about forty-five acres. Thereafter he conveyed twelve acres, part of this tract, being a lot not contiguous to the rest of it, and about the same time acquired by deed another lot containing thirty-three acres and located contiguous to the land which he had theretofore owned and devised as aforesaid. At the time of making the will he resided on the tract described therein, and at his death resided on the tract as changed as above stated. By the bill the executor alleged that Margaret E. Polite, the life tenant under item fifth, and Joseph M. Martin, the devisee thereunder in remainder, claimed that this thirty-three acre tract was a part of the tract devised to them, and that the residuary legatees claimed it to be a part of the estate of the deceased which had not been particularly devised, and, therefore, should be sold by the executor. The executor further represented that it could not convert, or fully administer, the estate as directed until the question so raised was settled, and asked for instructions. All of the devisees and legatees were made parties defendant. A demurrer to the bill by Margaret E. Polite for want of equity was overruled, and thereafter she answered the bill, claiming therein that the testator by the exchange of the two tracts intended that the thirty-three acre tract of land acquired after making the will became a part of the land described in the fifth item as “the place where I now reside”; that he in his lifetime declared such to be his intention; and that as further evidence of such intention he used and occupied the after-acquired tract as part of the place on which he resided at the time of making the will and at the time of his death. At the hearing of the cause, evidence was produced to show that by declarations by the testator his purpose in acquiring the thirty-three acre tract was to make it part of the home place. It was also shown that he removed the fence separating it from the land .theretofore owned by him, and cultivated and used it as part of the place or farm on which he resided until his death. This evidence was admitted after objection, and subject to be disregarded or stricken out if the court should conclude that it was inadmissible in evidence. Joseph L. Cahall, for complainant and for some of the residuary legatees. Robert C. White, for life tenant.',\n",

Case — Remote damages — Not the necessary consequence of injury complained ■ of— Cannot be shown under declaration charging such injury as the result of the direct act of the defendant — Highway commissioner — Order for removal of encroachment — Properly served on occupant of land — Bo held where legal title was in wife under unrecorded deed from husband, the occupancy remaining unchanged and husband controlling the la/nd —In suit by wife against highway commissioner for removal of such encroachment — Proceedings under statute against husband for maintaining same, based on such order for removal, a/re admissible as a defense— Legislature might authorize such removal without notice — Commissioner is justified only when encroachment exists — And is liable for trespass if existence of highway is successfully negatived — Law of 1881 (How. Stat. sec. 1871) extends to all public highways, whether actually laid out or such by user — Order for removed — Object of is to define extent of alleged encroachment— When it does this it is sufficient. 1. Plaintiff sued defendants in case to recover damages for the alleged wrongful destruction of a fence on her land, and for injuries to growing trees, all caused by the direct acts of defendants. On the trial she was permitted to testify that, by reason of the removal -of the fence, her husband or herself had to stay at home all the time; and at night, if the dog barked, she had to go out herself on account of her husband’s sickness, and had to keep the children out of school, all to prevent injury to the land orchard, and crops by cattle. Held, that these elements of damage were not the necessary consequence of the injury complained of, and that the testimony was inadmissible under the declaration, which counted merely for the destruction of the fence and injury to the trees by the direct acts of defendants. 2. Where a husband conveyed the home farm to his wife, the deed not being recorded, and the occupancy remained unchanged, the husband managing the farm the same as he did before such convey anee,, andi among other things built a fence which encroached on the highway; and, failing to remove the same on the order of the commissioner of highways, that officer took such steps as resulted in a judgment under the statute fixing the husband’s liability for the encroachment, the order for removal having been directed to and served upon him, of which facts the wife had full notice:— Held, in a suit brought by the wife to recover damages for the removal of the fence by the commissioner, that the order was properly served on the husband as occupant of the land; and that the proceedings in the suit wherein the husband’s liability for maintaining such encroachment was adjudicated were admissible as evidence in favor of the commissioner in the damage suit brought by the wife. 8. The statute (How. Stat. § 1371) purposely names the occwpant of land as the proper person to proceed against for the removal of an encroachment on the adjoining highway. To require such service to be made upon the owner involves an impossibility in many cases where such owners are infants, non-residents, or unknown; and the Legislature wisely regarded the occupier of the inclosure formed by the encroachment as the responsible party, upon whom service should be had. 4. It would have been competent for the Legislature to authorize the commissioner of highways to proceed and remove all encroachments upon the highways without any notice to the owner or occupant of adjoining lands; and certainly a law which provides for notice to the occupant cannot be held invalid to protect such officer because it fails to also require service on the owner of such lands. 5. A highway commissioner proceeding to remove an encroachment from the highway is justified only in the fact that the highway is encroached upon, and is liable for any trespass he may commit if it proves not to be a highway and an encroachment thereon. 6. The provisions of the highway law of 1881 (How. Stat. § 1371) relating to the removal of encroachments extend to all public highways, whether actually laid out or such from user. 7. Where the order of a commissioner of highways for the removal of a fence designated the alleged encroachment as “ a strip of land two rods in width, across the land of Frederick Krueger, the south end of private claim. No. 32, which now lies inclosed' by said fence,” and ordered “that such fence be removed, so that the road shall be opened and unobstructed, and of the width originally intended, which shall befourrods,”— Meld, that the object of such order and notice is to point out clearly the extent of the supposed encroachment, by declaring how far the fence lies from where it ought to be (People v. Smith, 42 Mich. 139), and that the order above described does this explicitly. Error to Wayne. (Jennison, J.) Argued May 5, 1886. Decided June 24, 1886. Case. Defendants bring error. Reversed. The facts are stated in the opinion and head-notes. George H. Prentis and B. T. Prentis, for appellants: Upon the record the land appeared to be the husband’s property, and plaintiff had lived there as his wife and only' in that right; and nothing had transpired to suggest that the husband had made the property over to her. Atwood v. Bearss, 47 Mich. 72. The statute seems to have provided for just such a case by making the occupant the party to be dealt with. But in this case the husband was such occupant, absolutely and for all purposes. Snyder v. People, 26 Mich. 106; Rowe v. Kellogg, 54 Id. 206. The husband is the head of the family: Powers v. Russell, 26 Mich. 179 ; and the wife is not obliged to take upon herself the management of the farm because it is deeded to her: Page v. Kendrick, 10 Mich. 300; Hill v. Bowman, 35 Id. 191. Under the facts in this case the possession was that of the-husband : Boos v. Gomber, 24 Wis. 499; and possession does not follow title in such a case: Lyon v. Green Bay & M. Ry. Co., 42 Id. 548. But even if the deed had been recorded, the husband’s possession “had continued>for so long a period as to afford ground for a probable inference or presumption that he must, as between himself and plaintiff, have either retained or acquired some right to the land or to its possession Bennett v. Robinson, 27 Mich. 30. The township records and map were admissible in evidence : Potter v. Safford, 50 Mich. 46. Proof of user for fifteen years was competent. Under the 1881 statute, the encroachment provisions apply to roads actually laid out or such by user. Finally, the alleged trespass was committed in what was actually used as a public road, and not on plaintiff’s land. Long practical acquiescence in the line of a highway will bind the public: Ellsworth v. Grand Rapids, 27 Mich. 250; Gregory v. Knight, 50 Id. 61; and if the public is bound, why not the owner ? Sylvester Lamed and Henry M, Cheever, for plaintiff : The admission of testimony after plaintiff had closed her case was a matter within the discretion of the court: White v. Bailey, 10 Mich. 155 ; D. & M. R. R. Co. v. Van Steinburg, 17 Id. 99; Kempsey v. McGinniss, 21 Id. 123; Duhois v. Campau, 24 Id. 360; People v. Saunders, 25 Id. 119; Morse v. Hewett, 28 Id. 481; Hutchins v. Kimmell, 31 Id. 126; Hulbert v. Hammond, 41 Id. 345. The fact that plaintiffs husband lived upon the land with her did not divest her of the legal title and the possession which followed it: White v. Zane, 10 Mich. 333; Agricultural Ins. Co. of Watertown v. Montague, 38 Id. 548. The-title being in plaintiff, and both being occupants of the premises, ejectment should have been brought against both in order to affect her rights and disturb her possession : Hodson v. Van Fossen, 26 Mich. 68 ; Hendricks v. Rasson, 42 Id. 104; Bunce v. Bidwell, 43 Id. 544. But this action is not to protect such joint possession, nor could its final result disturb the same; hence it does not fall within the rule laid down in Henry v. Gregory, 29 Mich. 69. The husband and family jointly occupying the land with the wife, who held the legal title, he could have complained of any unlawful interference therewith, but the wife could also complain : Rowe v. Kellogg, 54 Mich. 206. The encroachment proceedings, offered as a defense, were properly excluded. They were against the husband, and the notice of removal was of an “ obstruction,” not an “ encroachment.” Our laws make a marked distinction between obstructing a public highway and encroaching upon it: City of Grand Rapids v. Hughes, 15 Mich. 57; Roberts v. Highway Commissioners, 24 Id. 182. The mode of dealing with the two offenses is always different, and different penalties are provided. Code of 1827, 396-7, §§ 25-6; Code of 1833, p. 111; R. S. 1838, p. 128; R. S. 1846, p. 138; Comp. Laws 1857, p. 366; Laws of 1861, p. 153; How. Stat. § 1371. The penalty for obstructing a highway cannot be enforced by indictment or information : Pettinger v. People, 20 Mich. 336. The statute providing for proceedings in case of an encroachment applies only to roads actually laid out: Roberts v. Highway Commissioners, 25 Mich. 23; Campau v. Button, 33 Id. 525; Gregory v. Stanton, 40 Id. 271; Willson v. Gifford, 42 Id. 454; People v. Smith, Id. 138. The order to remove the encroachment was properly excluded, because it failed to properly designate the existence of the same: People v. Smith, 42 Mich. 138.\",\n",

       "  'case_summary': \"[Civ. No. 1065. Third Appellate District. April 25, 1913.] CORNELIA L. JANKE, Respondent, v. WALFRED H. McMAHON, Appellant. Adverse Possession—Mere Occupancy of Land—Payment of Taxes. Mere occupancy of land, not under a claim of title, is insufficient to establish title by adverse possession, although the statute at the time of the occupancy does not require the payment of taxes to vest such title. Id.—Evidence of Advepse Holding—Burden of Proof.—The burden of proof is upon the person in possession and claiming against the holder of the legal title, to show that his occupancy is hostile and not subordinate to the legal title; he must prove all the essential elements of adverse possession. Id.—Open Possession not Necessarily Adverse.—Possession may be open and notorious, and still not adverse. Id.—Claim op Title—Beliep as to Boundaries.—The belief of a landowner that his lot extends to the limits of his inelosure is not equivalent to a claim of title or right, and is therefore not sufficient to sustain an adverse possession. Id.—Occupancy op Land—Claim op Right—Code Sections.—The “occupancy” referred to in section 1007 of the Civil Code must be construed in connection with the corresponding provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, and to overcome the legal title the occupancy must be under a claim of right, or adverse, as that term is used in the law. Id.—Evidence Against Adverse Holding—Assessment op Taxes.— The fact that one in possession of land does not have it assessed to himself is strongly persuasive that he does not claim to be the owner. Id.—Boundaries—Mistake—Estoppel to Claim True Line.—Where there is an acquiescence in a wrong boundary when the true boundary may be ascertained from the muniments of title, it is treated as a mistake, and estoppel to claim the true line does not arise. Id.—Acquiescence in Boundary—Absence op Dispute or Uncertainty.—Where a boundary fence is built on what the parties suppose to be the true line, and there is no dispute, and it is not known that there is any uncertainty, the establishment of a boundary by implied consent and acquiescence does not follow therefrom. Id.—Action to Recover Real Property—Improvements—Findings.— In this action for the recovery of real property it was proper for the court to find the facts as they existed at the time of the filing of the complaint, thereby not taking cognizance of improvements made thereafter by the defendant. Id.—Findings—When Immaterial.-—Findings attacked by the appellant are immaterial where they could not have altered the judgment if they had been in his favor. Id.—Failure op Court to Find on Some Averments.—A contention by the appellant that the trial court failed to find upon certain averments of the answer does not demand specific consideration on appeal if certain findings of the court, which are supported by the evidence, control and uphold the judgment. Id.—Action to Recover Real Property—Improvements—Evidence.— In an action for the recovery of land, where the court is justified in concluding that at the time the defendant made improvements the plaintiff believed they were not located upon his land, and that the defendant knew, or had ready means of knowing, that they were located upon the plaintiff’s land, evidence that the plaintiff' permitted the improvements without protest may properly be excluded.

Forcible Entry and Detainer — Questions presented. — In actions of forcible entry and detainer two questions are presented, viz. : Was plaintiff at tbe time of tbe entiy by defendant exercising sucb acts of dominion over the property as constitute actual possession in law; and did defendant forcibly deprive plaintiff of this possession ? 2. Title not involved, but Character and Extent of Possessory Eights. — The ownership of the premises is not involved and title is not tried; but evidence of title is sometimes received for the purpose of showing the character and extent of the plaintiff’s possession or the origin of defendant’s'alleged right of possession. 3. Judgment on Conflicting Evidence. — The supreme court will ordinarily not interfere with the findings or judgment of the trial judge predicated upon conflicting testimony; such testimony having been received in open court. 4. Acts showing Legal Possession under Tax Deed. — M. received a tax deed in pursuance of purchase at a tax sale; he paid taxes • for the period of nine years thereafter; he posted a notice on the premises advertising it for sale by himself; he made a contract of lease, first verbal, afterwards written, with one Y. to occupy the premises for gardening purposes; he furnished posts and wire for fencing and plowed the ground; Y. set the posts and attached the wire thereto; under this arrangement for seven years the ground was plowed every year, three times by M. himself; M. gave ahorse and pony to Y. to aid in cultivating the premises; seven years after receiving his deed he had two surveys made and erected posts according to a new survey, putting wire on some of them: Held, that the foregoing acts showed actual possession inlaw: Held, also, that evidence tending to show that during the period named W., the lessor of P., deraigning title from the United States through patent and mesne conveyances, had constructed or partly constructed a fence around the premises, was not such an interruption of M.’s possession as to change M.’s legal status. 5. Acts constituting a Forcible Entry upon the Property. — P. in collusion with others caused a frame dwelling to be moved upon the premises occupied by the lessee of M. ; nine or ten men and six teams were employed in the removal; not more than ten min utes were consumed in cutting the fence wires, digging up posts and getting the house upon the ground from the adjacent street: V., the agent of M., objected to the proceeding; P. immediately after the removal brought up furniture which was upon a wagon standing in a hollow near by, and took possession of the house: Held, that a forcible entry was sufficiently shown. 6. Who may maintain Forcible Entry and Detainer. — The owner of realty may maintain in his own name the action of forcible entry and detainer, though the premises are at the time occupied by an agent under a verbal arrangement to take care of the same.

Trespass; Lands; Evidence Mitigating Damages. — Where the action was for trespass to land by removing a house therefrom, the defendant on proof of his ownership to the house may invoke in mitigation of damages the provisions of section 6026, Code 1907, under the plea of the general issue. 2. Sarnie; Jury Question. — Under the evidence in this case it was a question for the jury whether or not in erecting the house shown to be on the lands of another by a subsequent survey, the defendant believed in good faith that it was on his own land, so as to entitle him to the material therein and not to render him liable for trespass for removing it. 3. Same; Instructions. — Where the evidence was uncertain as to whether the house was on the plaintiff’s land or on defendant’s adjacent land, a charge asserting that there was no evidence of the taking and carrying away of any property of plaintiff, and that the jury could not estimate any damages on account thereof, was invasive of the province of'the jury, and properly refused. 4. Same. — Where the only witness who knew of the boundary line between plaintiff and defendant was not positive that the house alleged to have been removed was on plaintiff’s land, a charge which assumed that the house removed was on plaintiff’s land was erroneous. 5. Samo. — Where it appeared that defendant’s grantor built a house on land subsequently shown to belong to plaintiff and one of the issues under the evidence was whether the defendant’s grantor knew when he built the house that it was on the lands of another, a charge asserting that fourteen years was not a reasonable time within which to remove the house asstunes that the builder knew that the house was on the land of another when he built it, and was erroneous. O. Same.- — In an action for trespass to laud, a charge asserting that if the jury believe that the trespass was malicious, they might assess exemplary damages assumed that a trespass was committed, and was erroneous. 7. Same; Right to Recover. — In order to recover in'trespass'to land by the removal oí a house therefrom, the plaintiff is under the necessity of showing possession either actual or constructive, of the house at the time, and where he relies on constructive possession under title, he must show that the house was on his land. 8. Improvements; Location by Mistake; Boundary. — The purpose of section G02G, is to prevent one who innocently and mistakenly erects a building on the land of another from losing the materials in the structure; and where the location of a boundary line is doubtful and improvements are made under the honest belief that they 'are not placed on the' land of another, the person making such improvements does not lose the right to the ownership thereof, though a subsequent survey places them on the land of another. 9. Same; Effect of Making; Removal. — -Where one did not know positively that a house previously erected by him was on the lands of another until after survey, it was not incumbent on him to remove the building until after the ownership was settled by the survey, although it might have been constructed for many years prior thereto. 10. Appeal and Error; Instructions; Partly Bad; Exception Thereto. — Where part of a charge is bad and confusing and the other part good, the court will not be put in error for giving it if the exception thereto does not separate the bad from the good.

Lamont against tbe Marbury Lumber Company ancl others for trespass to land. From a judgment for plaintiff, defendants appeal. Reversed and remanded. Tbe trespass counted on is entering upon tbe lands of tbe plaintiff and tearing down and removing a bouse, or a part of tbe bouse and using tbe materials so taken away to build or repair a bouse on the lands belonging to tbe defendant. Tbe contention of tbe defendant was that tbe bouses were built by mistake across tbe line on Mrs. Lamont’s land, and were used by them for some years as tenant bouses until 1905, when a • survey was made showing tbe bouses to be on the land deeded to Mrs. Lamont. There was evidence pro and con as to tbe knowledge of tbe defendants of the line in question, or, rather, of his predecessor in title. Tbe court gave tbe following charges at tbe instance of tbe plaintiff: (B) “I charge you that 14 years is not a reasonable time in which to remove property.” (A) “If the jury believe that tbe trespass was malicious, they may assess exemplary damages in their discretion for tbe effect upon and example to tbe community.” The following charges were requested by tbe defendant: (4) “Under tbe evidence in this case, I charge you that there is no evidence of tbe taking or carrying away of any property of tbe plaintiff, and you cannot estimate any damages on account of such.” Tbe following part of tbe oral- charge was objected to.: “Now, on the other hand, if tbe Marbury Lumber Company knew that this was the property of another, and they went and, with utter and gross carelessness, and willful violation of tbe law and utter disregard of another’s rights, did, or had done, this act,' why, of course, from tbe evidence, if you should so decide, it would be your duty to find for the plaintiff; and, furthermore, if you should find for the plaintiff, then there comes another point as to the amount of damages. The actual damages, as I have said, have been proved. The next point will be as to the punitive damages. I charge you, if you find punitive damages, if you find from the evidence the parties did it in a wilful, reckless, wanton, or malicious violation of the law and rights of others, if the evidence has so impressed you. why, then, of course, you should give such damages as you see proper.” Ray Rushton, for appellant. The defendant was entitled to take advantage of the provision of section 602(5, Code 1907, and to adduce proof to show his honest belief and intention in erecting the house, under die plea of the general issue.

In an action against a borough to recover damages for personal injuries caused by a fall into a hole in a sidewalk upon a street in the built-up part of the borough, it appeared that the sidewalk had originally been paved up to the fence line, but the municipal authorities had required the property owners to move the fence back about two feet, which left within the lines of the new sidewalk space a strip about two feet wide depressed to considerable depth below the general level of the sidewalk. This space had partially been filled in, with cinders and other materials, but at the point where the plaintiff was injured there had been suffered to remain for over a year a depression about eight inches deep which extended into the sidewalk a distance of two feet. The plaintiff was walking along the street leading her child, snow had recently fallen to a considerable depth and a narrow path had been beaten down through the snow by pedestrians. The plaintiff permitted the child which she was leading by the hand to walk in the track beaten through the snow, she herself walking on the sidewalk by the side of the path. The drifting snow had filled up and thus concealed from view the depression in the sidewalk, and the plaintiff stepped into it, fell and was injured.

Trespass: Gutting of timber: Aiding and abetting: Vendor and purchaser: Disputed boundary: Judgment: Gonclusiveness: Title' to land: Dismissal of action: Oosts: Appeal: Printed case. 1. One who sells and conveys the timber on his own land is not liable for a trespass upon adjoining land committed by the-purchaser while removing such timber, unless he aided and abetted the commission of such trespass. 2. Where the vendor of timber on certain land told the purchaser that a fence had been built on what he supposed was the west, boundary but that the purchaser should have the line surveyed and satisfy himself, and the purchaser afterwards employed a surveyor who found that the fence was substantially on the-true line, the fact that the vendor was present when the survey was made and, with others, shared the expense thereof because he wished to know where the line was, would not, if he acted in good faith, render him liable for a trespass by the purchaser in cutting to the line of the fence, which was not the true line. 3. Nor could such vendor be deemed to have aided and abetted such trespass merely because, when sued therefor, he denied in his-answer that any trespass had been committed, and upon the-trial sought to show that the line surveyed was correct. 4. While a final judgment is conclusive as to issues arising on the-pleadings which were or might have been litigated, it does not, in itself, necessarily determine what was litigated or how each-particular question was decided; and the facts in that regard may be shown by the findings, by the verdict, by the bill of exceptions, or by extrinsic evidence. 5. Thus, in an action for trespass to land, where defendant denied plaintiff’s ownership and the jury found that plaintiff owned the land but that defendant did not trespass thereon, a judgment dismissing the complaint would not have the effect to deprive the plaintiff of his land, but on the contrary would be conclusive as to his ownership; and such judgment in the case-would be proper. 6. Costs for a printed case violating Supreme Court Rule 6 are disallowed under Rule 44. Kerwin, Siebecker, and Timlin, JJ., dissenting, are of the opinion that the evidence shows that the vendor of the timber- aided and abetted tlie commission of the trespass in cutting to the line of the fence mentioned; and that, even if that were not so, upon the pleadings and the finding of title to the disputed strip in plaintiff the latter was entitled to judgment for nominal damages and costs. Appeal from a judgment of the circuit court for Juneau ■county; J. J. FRüit, Circuit Judge. Reversed. The plaintiff brought suit to recover the value of some logs •and timber alleged to have been wrongfully cut and removed ■from his lands. The defendant denied that any trespass was committed upon the lands of the plaintiff, and set up as ■a separate defense that, if any timber was cut upon plaintiff’s lands, it was cut without the knowledge, authority, or direction of the defendant, by one Blakeslee, to whom the defendant sold the timber on certain parcels of land owned by him and adjoining those of the plaintiff. The' answer also set up some facts tending to show that the plaintiff was es-topped from claiming any recovery against the defendant because of the alleged trespass. The jury by a special verdict found that Blakeslee cut and removed certain timber from the lands of the plaintiff, but also found that the defendant did not aid, abet, counsel, or advise Blakeslee to cut the timber beyond the true boundary line between the lands •of the plaintiff and the defendant. The value of the standing timber so cut and removed was found to be $12.50, and that the highest market value of the logs into which such timber was cut was $25.

       "  'case_summary': \"NEW YORK COMMON PLEAS. Jonathan N. Havens agt. Christian Klein. Special Term, February, 1875. Basements—light and aim —fire-esea/pe—permanent injunction. Where a common owner of two tenements—the windows of one of which overlook the yard of the other and receive light and air therefrom, its shutters swing out over such yard, and access from its fire-escapes, which overhang the yard, being had to such yard—severs the same by conveyances to different persons, an easement in favor of the tenement so overlooking the other, it being the one first conveyed, is created in respect to light and air, the swinging of the shutters, and access to and from the fire-escapes. Such easement is an apparent one. The grantee of the servient tenement, the one later conveyed, is deemed to have actual notice of such easement, and takes his title subject thereto. In such case it is immaterial whether such severance be by deed or mortgage, inasmuch as by foreclosure the mortgage is ripened into a deed. The facts in this case were as follows: Plaintiff was the owner of the premises No. 125 East Fiftieth street, in New York city, situated on the north side ■of Fiftieth street, sixty feet west of Lexington avenue, and being twenty feet in width by forty-nine feet deep. Defend..ant owned premises on the west side of Lexington avenue, forty-nine feet north of Fiftieth street, twenty feet in width and eighty feet deep. A house on plaintiff’s lot— a French flat — extended the whole depth of his lot. A house on defendant’s lot, likewise a French flat, extended sixty feet ■deep. So that the northeasterly corner of plaintiff’s house impinged the southwesterly comer of defendant’s house. The relative positions are shown on the following diagram: Plaintiff’s house had five stories, with three windows in each, looking out over the yard belonging to defendant. These windows each had shutters which swung out over defendant’s said yard. • And in the angle of the houses were built fire-escapes for ■each story, for the mutual use of each house, access thereto being had from the windows of the same. These premises, in the state described, had at one time been owned by a common owner, one. Buddensick, who, while owner of both lots, had in 1871 built the houses in the manner stated. He thereafter mortgaged both, executing, the mortgage upon the Fiftieth street house first. It was also recorded first. This mortgage contained the usual grant of said premises with all the “ rights, privileges, hereditaments and appurtenances thereunto belonging.” Both mortgages were in time foreclosed. And under the decrees in foreclosure, and sundry mesne conveyances, the title to the Fiftieth street house became vested in plaintiff; that to the Lexington avenue house in defendant. In November, 1874, defendant built in his said yard, close to plaintiff’s house, but upon his own land, a scaffolding forty-five feet high, upon which, opposite each of plaintiff’s windows, he affixed boarding, flat up against the wall of plaintiff’s house, in such a manner that none of the shutters of plaintiff’s rear windows could be opened, access to the fire-escapes out of the windows was prevented, and all light and air through the windows excluded, and the value of the house in that state, as an inhabitable dwelling, reduced to almost nothing. Upon these facts the plaintiff brought this fiction, to restrain the defendant from continuing such obstructions, and to have his right to light and air through such windows from defendant’s land, and to swing his shutters on defendant’s land, and to have access undisturbed to said fire escapes declared and enforced, and for a perpetual injunction. According to the practice of the state of New York, an order to show cause why an injunction should not be granted pending the action, was obtained, with- a temporary injunction meantime, and on the return of such order, defendant appeared to show cause, and moved to vacate the temporary injunction, plaintiff moving to make it permanent.

The evidence showed that the fence\\'was two feet north of the northern line of the land described in the complaint, and that defendant had constructed the south wall of his building so that a portion of it extended over a part of the two foot strip, and parallel with the driveway. Held, that notwithstanding there was evidence tending to show that the fence had been for twenty-five years considered the boundary line by plaintiff and defendant’s grantors the judgment enjoining defendant from maintaining the wall was not authorized by the complaint and was outside of the issues.

This is an action in trespass and for the plaintiff to maintain it she must have been in the possession of the premises upon which the trespass was committed at the time of its commission. “In order to maintain trespass quare clausum fregit there must have been an actual possession by the plaintiff at the time when the trespass was committed, either by himself or his authorized representative.” (28 Am, and Eng. Ency. Law [2 Ed.], page 573; Newcomb v. Love et al., 70 N.. W. 443 ■,Kenney et al. v. Ferguson, 59 N. W. 401; Buggies v. Sands, 40 Mich. 559; Uttendorffer v. Saegers, 50 Calif. 496.) The phrase, “dedicated to the use of the public,” is defined in sec. 2066, Compiled Laws of Utah 1888: “All roads, streets,\\' alleys and bridges laid out or erected by others than the public, and dedicated or abandoned to the use of the pub-lis, are highways. A highway shall be deemed and taken as dedicated and abandoned to the use of the public when it has been continuously and uninterruptedly used as a public thoroughfare for a period of ten years.” This was in force at the time Tuckfield took down the sign, quit paying taxes on, and abandoned the premises to the use of the public.- In the Bevised Statutes of Utah of 1898 this section is divided into sections 1114 and 1115, the later section is as follows: “A highway shall be deemed to have been dedicated and abandoned to the nse of the public when it has been continuously used as a public thoroughfare for a period of ten years.” A man may dedicate his land to the use of the public to be used as a street, with or without writing by fencing it out to be used as such, or by acquiescence in such use, or by expressing his assent to such use or his intention to dedicate may be inferred from his acquiescence in its continued use as a road, or street, or an alley. (Wilson v. Hull, 7 Utah 90; 9 Am. and Eng. Ency. of Law [2 Ed.],, p. 34; Morgan v. Railroad Co., 96 U. S. 716-723; Oity of Cincinnati v. White’s Lessee, 6 Peters 440; 2 Greenleaf on Evidence, sec. 662; Elliott, Roads\\'and Streets, pp. 91-92-98 and 99; Jones on Easements, sec. 424; Bchettler et al. v. Lynch et al., 23 Utah 305.) The court under the pleadings was called upon to decide whether a trespass had been committed on certain described premises, and it goes outside of those premises and finds that the plaintiff, by adverse possession, held the title to other premises, that the adverse possession was because a certain fence had been an undisputed boundary between properties for over thirty years, and found that trespass had been committed upon that property in a way entirely different from that laid in the complaint, and enjoined the defendant from maintaining a building thereon. If there ever was a case in which the court found issues not made by the pleadings, this is that case. That the findings and judgment must conform to and be within the issues made by the pleadings is an elementary principle of law and is well established by many authorities, a few of which we cite below. 11 Ency. PI. and Pi\\\\, p. 872, states the rule as follows: “This rule is of universal application, and whether the action or suit be at law, in equity, or under the code, the judgment must be secundum allegata et probata.” “Judgment based upon issues not made by the pleadings are coram non judice and void and may be set aside or disregarded even in a collateral proceeding.” {11 Ency. PL and Pr. 878; Burneit v. Stearns, 33 Cal. 837; •Gregory v. Nelson, 41 Cal. 244.) “The plaintiff cannot declare on one • theory and •recover on another.” (Peay v. Salt Lahe Oity) 11 Utah 331; Idaho F. Oo. v. Insurance Oo., 8 Utah 41; Poynter v. Ohapman, 8 Utah 442; Turner v. Utah Title, etc., 10 Utah ■61; Vance v. Whalen, 7 Utah 44; Bachman v. Sepulveda, 39 Calif. 688; Northern B. Go. et al. v. Jordan et al., 87 Calif. 23; 11 Ehcy. PI. and Pr., 868; Kennedy & Shaw Lumber Oo. et al. v. Priet et al., 115 Cal. 98; Sowles et al. ■V. Glawson, 76 Pac. 1067.) RESPONDENT’S POINTS. Appellant says that the plaintiff was not in the possession of the property, and therefore cannot maintain her action. He cites the Encyclopedia, second edition, volume 28, page 573, to the effect briefly, that in order to maintain trespass there must have been an actual possession by the plaintiff at the time when the trespass was committed. He omits to ■quote from the same section these words, “or failing that a ■constructive possession in respect to that right being actually vested in him.” The three Michigan cases ■ cited by him do not liold that a constructive possession is not sufficient, and are not in point at all, for the reason that Michigan is a common law State, and distinguishes very closely and nicely between trespass and case. Which distinction is unknown to ■our Code of Civil Procedure. The case in 50 Cal. did not involve the question of constructive possession at all. In that case the court held that the defendant could properly show that a third person was in actual possession as tenants, and as affecting the measure of plaintiff’s damages. Actual possession is not necessary to maintain an action of trespass where the party has the title to the soil. The title ■drawing to the possession. (Gairo, etc., By. Oo. v. Woolsey, 85 Ill\". 370; Warren v. Gochran, 80 N. H. 379.) One having the legal title to a strip of land over which another claims a right of way has constructive possession and maintains trespass against tbe other for wrongful entry, tearing down fences, etc. (Hurt v. Adams, 86 Mo. App. 73.) Tbe defendant claims tbat tbis rod of ground became a highway under sec. 2066, Compiled Laws of 1888, and see. 1115, Revised Statutes of 18198. It is a sufficient answer to. tbis to say tbat tbe evidence wholly fails to show tbat tbis rod of ground has been continuously and uninterruptedly used as a public thoroughfare for tbe statutory period. The evidence shows tbat whatever travel over tbis rod of ground there was, or whatever use was made of it by any person other than tbe owners, was in connection with tbe rest of tbe T\\'uckfield property, and tbat its use was tbe use which is ordinarily made of a private way. A private way cannot be transformed into a public way by user. (City of Indianapolis v. Kingsbury101 Ind. 201.) “Where there is nothing more than a mere license there is no dedication; where the use is merely permissive, with authority in the owner in the servient estate to put an end to the use of his pleasure, there is no dedication. Nor in such a case are there such acts as will enable the courts to infer an intent to dedicate.” (Elliott on Roads and Streets [1 Ed.], 96.) Dedication is never to be presumed without evidence of unequivocal intention on the part of the owner. (Quinn v. Anderson, 70 Cal. 454.) A mere permissive use does not ripen into a right. (Harhness v. Wood-mansee, 70 Utah 227.) Counsel say: “Each city lot is 165 feet wide.” Who says it is ? Mr. Paul says so, and he says so because Mr. Doremus assumed, contrary to the fact, that it was so, and drew a map upon such assumption and filed it in his office. It needs no argument nor authority we take it to convince this court that titles cannot be divested nor acquired by any such nonsensical proceedings. Where the boundaries of a tract of land are, are questions of fact for the jury. (1 Thompson on Trials, 1461. White v. Spreclcles, 75 Cal. 610.) Where parties acquiesce in a certain line as thé boundary for twenty years • neither can thereafter claim beyond such line. {Strichley v. Hill, 22 Utah 257; Larsen v. Onesite, 21 Utah 38; McMaster v. Morse, 18 Utah 21; Burris v. Fitch, Y6 Cal. 395.) A judgment must sbow what part of plaintiff’s close was trespassed tupon or the judgment will not be a bar in a subsequent suit. (Howard v. Allen, 100 Mass. 236; Dunkel v. Wiles, 11 N. Y. 420.) To say that findings must conform to‘the pleadings is not to imply that they must be identical therewith in language. In the case at bar the complaint is ¡general: For trespass on certain\\'land. The findings show ■specific trespass on particular part of the land, in\\'every respect, therefore, within the issues. STATEMENT OE-EACTS. Plaintiff, as the administratrix of the estate of Charles IB. Tuckfield, deceased, brought this action to recover damages\\' for trespass alleged to have been committed by defendant ■on certain premises belonging to said estate, and for an order perpetually restraining and enjoining defendant from •continuing such trespass. The allegations of the complaint upon which plaintiff relies for a recovery of damages and injunctive relief are as follows: “That the estate of said ■Charles B. Tuckfield, and the plaintiff as the administratrix thereof, at all times herein, mentioned, was the owner of the ■certain premises in Sale Lake County, Utah, described as follows, to-wit: Beginning at a point three rods north of the ■southwest corner of lot 4, in block 35, plat A. Salt Lake City survey; thence north one rod; thence east twelve rods; thence south one rod; thence west twelve rods, to place of beginning, and a certain fence on the northern line of said premises. That on or about the — day of May, 1901, the defendant forcibly broke and entered upon said land, the same being in the possession of the plaintiff, and took down a large part) of said fence, and also then and there disturbed the plaintiff in the use and occupation of said land, and prevented her from enjoying the same as she otherwise would have •done. That the defendant has since said last-named date continually trespassed upon and over\\'said premises, and all against the repeated protests of plaintiff, and has continual ly and almost daily driven horses and wagons and other vehicles over said land and used the same as a driveway and means of entrance upon and into certain other premises occupied by defendant” — to plaintiff’s damage in the sum of $200. The defendant in his answer admitted using the land described in the complaint as a driveway; but alleged that, during the twenty years prior to the commencement of th& action the strip of land mentioned was a public thoroughfare,, and “had been by the owners thereof dedicated and abandoned to \\' the use of the public as and \\' for a public highway for more than ten years prior to the commencement of the action.” The strip of land in question is situated between Fifth and Sixth South \"streets and extends from State street east to the center of block 35, and for more than ten years prior to the commencement of the action had been used as an alleyway. In-December, 1900, defendant purchased a strip of ground fronting on State street two and one-half rods in width and twelve rods in length, joining and paralleling the plaintiff’s, premises on the north, and constructed thereon a brick building, the south wall of which extends 1.8 feet south of the line of an old fence which was erected on or near the boundary line betwéen plaintiff’s and defendant’s premises. The-court, among other things, found that the strip of land in question (describing it by metes and bounds, as alleged in the complaint) belonged to said estate, and that no part of the same had been dedicated as a public highway, and “that the premises extended to, and the plaintiffs were the owners thereof, a line coincident with the line of a certain fence which formed the northern boundary line of said premises,” and that the south wall of a brick foundry owned by defendant is over and upon plaintiff’s said premises a distance of 1.8 feet. Judgment was entered awarding plaintiff $24 damages, and defendant was perpetually enjoined from trespassing on said premises and.from maintaining the said south wall of his said foundry upon the 1.8 feet of ground referred\\' to.

       "  'case_summary': 'Dorlan v. Westervitch. Statutory Action of Ejectment. 1. Ejectment; plaintiff can prove that deed offered in evidence includes lands described in complaint. — In an action of ejectment, it is competent for the plaintiff, upon the examination of a civil engineer who had surveyed the land sued for, to ask the witness if the lands described in the complaint constitute a part of the lands described in a deed handed to the witness, and which the plaintiff offered in evidence. 2. Same; adverse possession; proof of how much land plaintiff claimed. — In an action of ejectment, where the plaintiff claims title by virtue of adverse possession under a deed constituting color of title, it .is competent upon the examination of plaintiff as a witness, to ask how much land the plaintiff had been claiming to own after the execution of the deed under which the plaintiff claimed. 3. Adverse possession; void deed admissible in evidence, as constituting color of title. — In an action of ejectment, where the plaintiff claims title to the land sued for by virtue of adverse possession under color of title, a deed purporting to convey said lands to the plaintiff, though not properly executed and void as a conveyance, is admissible in evidence to show the extent of the plaintiff’s possession, and as constituting color of title. 4. Tenants in common; oo-tenant can maintain ejectment. — A tenant in common has such an interest in the lands of the co-tenancy as entitles him to the enjoyment of the entire estate as against a stranger; and, therefore, one of several co-tenants can alone maintain an action of ejectment against a stranger to try the title to the lands owned in common. 5. Ejectment; color of title; admissibility of deed with uncertain description.- — To constitute color of title, it is not necessary that the deed under which the party claims should be so definite in the description of the lands admitted to be conveyed, that there should be no uncertainty in it, provided it is such as will enable a surveyor to ascertain and locate the. land, and, therefore, a deed, though uncertain in its description, if sufficiently certain to enable the land to be located, is admissible in evidence0 as color of title. 6. Ejectment; proof of possession by tescimony of third person. In an action of ejectment where the plaintiff and the defendant claim title by adverse possession, the testimony of the witness for the defendant that the father of the defendant, under whom the defendant claims, was in the possession, of the lands for ten or fifteen years, is admissible; such testimony tending to support a claim of adverse possession on the part of the defendant and those under whom he held. 7. Ejectment; adverse possession; charge of court to jury. — In an action of ejectment, where the plaintiff and defendant each claims adverse possession for the statutory period necessary to perfect title in himself and neither shows muniment of title better than the other, and there is evidence on the part of each tending to support his claim, charges which assume that the plaintiff had a better right of possession to begin with than the defendant, and which takes away from the jury the consideration of the conflicting evidence as to who had prior possession, are erroneous and should not be given. 8. Same; same; same. — In such a case where there is evidence tending to support the hypothesis thereof, a charge asserts a correct proposition, and should be given at the request of the defendant, which instructs the jury that if they believe that the plaintiff limited her claim to the land mentioned in the deed made to her, “although she has not claimed the land described in the complaint for ten years continuously under said deed, then she would not be entitled to recover, although the jury may believe the land sued for is embraced in the description contained in said deed.” 9. Deed as color of title; not necessary for it to he recorded. — It is not necessary to make a deed effective as a color of title that it should be recorded. Appeal from the Circuit Court of Mobile. Tried before the Hon. Wm. S. Anderson. This was a statutory action of ejectment brought by the appellee, Elizabeth Westervitch, against the appeh lant, George Dorian, to recover certain lands, specific-, ally described in the complaint. The claim to title on the part of both the plaintiff and defendant was derived from adverse possession. The plaintiff’s right of possession was based upon a deed from one Joseph Rose to the plaintiff and her husband, by which deed the said Rose attempted to convey unto the plaintiff property which included the property sued for in this action. This deed was executed in 1884. The said Joseph Rose claimed under a deed executed to him by one G. Horton, judge of probate. This deed was dated April 23d, 1874, and recited that the taxes on the lands therein described had not been paid for the years 1866 to 1871, inclusive, and that the said Rose was the purchaser of said lands at the tax sale. Said deed was not acknowledged before any officer or attested by any witness, and was not filed for record until April 15th, 1886. The defendant claimed to derive title from his father, Mulford Dorian, who held a deed from one Powell, who was the purchaser of the lands at an execution sale; said execution having been issued upon a judgment recovered against one Phillip Ignard, and levied upon the said land as belonging to said Ignard. The defendant also offered in evidence a deed from one John A. Cuth-bert to said Phillip Ignard, purporting to convey the said land. This deed, however, was not allowed to be introduced in evidence. There Avas evidence introduced on the part of defendant tending to show that after Mul-ford Dorland purchased the property from Powell, he went in possession thereof, and permitted one Oriminell and one Shambeau, each of whom was a son-in-law, to build two houses upon said property, each of which said houses was occupied by said Criminell and Sham-beau, respectively, at different times. There was also evidence introduced on the part of defendant tending to show that the plaintiff admitted to one Tam, who was the tax commissioner of Mobile county, that the land in question belonged to said Dorian. The plaintiff introduced evidence tending to show that since the purchase of said lands by herself and her husband from Joseph Rose, she had been in continuous possession thereof, exercising acts of ownership over said lands, and that one \\' of the houses that was built upon said lands was occupied at the time of the institution of this suit by one Dr. Davis, under a contract of lease with her. It was also shown that the husband of the plaintiff was dead at the time of the institution of suit. The other facts of the case necessary to an understanding of the decision on the present appeal are sufficiently stated in the opinion. The court, at the request of the plaintiff, gave to the jury, among others, the following written charges, to the giving of each of which the defendant separately excepted : (1.) “The court charges the jury that under the evidence in this case, if believed by the jury, the plaintiff is entitled to recover all of the land described in the complaint except that portion thereof upon which is located the two houses, one of which is spoken of in the evidence as having been built by Criminell, and the other of which is spoken of in the evidence as being occupied by Doctor Davis; and the court further charges the jury that the evidence in the case, if believed by the jury, also entitled the plaintiff to recover the land upon which each of these houses is built, unless the jury is reasonably satisfied from the evidence that the defendant and those under whom he claims have been in the open, notorious, exclusive and adverse possession thereof continuously for a period of ten years.” (2.) “The court charges the jury that the undisputed evidence in this case, if believed by the jury, entitles the plaintiff to recover all of the lands sued for in the complaint which are outside of the enclosure around the two houses, one of which is spoken of in the evidence as having been built by one Criminell, and the other of which is spoken of in the evidence as being occupied by Doctor Davis.” (3.) “The court charges the jury that under the evidence in this case, if believed.by the jury, the plaintiff is entitled to recover all-of the lands sued for in the complaint except such portions thereof as the jury may be reasonably satisfied from the evidence have been in the actual, open, notorious and exclusive possession of the defendant and his father for a continuance period of ten years, if the jury are so satisfied as to any part thereof.” (5.) “The court charges the jury that there is no evidence in this case that the defendant or his father ever had any possession of any portion of the land in question, except such as ivas occupied by the houses which were erected thereon by Criminell and Shambeau.” (6.) “The court charges the jury that the defendant has not shown any right whatever, to any part of the lands sued for in the complaint, unless\\'the jury believe from the evidence that the defendant and his father have been in the open, notorious, continuous, adverse and exclusive possession of some part of said land for a period of ten years; and even if the defendant has reasonably satisfied the jury that they have been in such possession of a part of said land, then this would confer upon him the right only to that part of which they had such actual possession.” (9.) “The court charges the jury that the evidence in this case, if believed by the jury, entitles the ■plaintiff to recover all of the land described in the complaint not occupied by either of the houses spoken of in the evidence as having been built by Criminell and Shambeau, respectively, and also entitles the plaintiff to recover the land occupied by these houses unless the jury are reasonably satisfied from the evidence that the defendant and his father, under whom he claims, were in the possession of one or both of said houses, and that this possession was not only open, notorious and exclusive, but that it continued consecutively for ten years, and the defendant can defeat the plaintiff’s recovery, if the jury believe all of the evidence, only as to Avhatever portion, if any, the jury may find that the defendant or his father acquired the title to by means of such open, notorious, exclusive, adverse and continuous possession for ten years.” (10.) “The court charges the jury that there is no evidence in this case that the defendant ever bad any right or title to any part of the land sued for, whatsoever, unless it was obtained by the open, notorious, exclusive and adverse possession thereof for a continuous period of ten years, and there is no evidence that he ever had any such possession of any part of the land sued for except as was occupied by the two houses built by Criminell and Shambeau, and the question whether he ever had such possession of the land occupied by either of such houses is a question for the determination by the jury from the evidence.” (11.) “The court charges the jury that while the tax deed in this case was void and of itself conveyed no title, yet if Rose entered into the possession of the land claiming the same thereunder, and then conveyed the land to the plaintiff and she took possession under the deed, this would give her a good right to the land as against the defendant and all other persons having no title thereto, and her claim could not be defeated by them without proving that they had subsequently-taken the possession of the land and retained it for ten years in their open, notorious, actual exclusive possession.” The defendant requested the court to give to the jury the following written charges, and separately excepted to the court’s refusal to give each of them as asked: (1.) “The statute of limitations, or claim by adverse possession, under the tax deed to Joseph Rose was not set in operation until it was recorded.” (3.) “If the jury believe from the evidence that the plaintiff limited her claim to the land mentioned in the deed made to her by Joseph Rose, on the north side by the south line of the land sued for, and if she has not claimed the land described in the complaint for ten years continuously, under said deed, then she wmuld not be entitled to recover although the jury may believe the land sued for is embraced in the description contained in said deed.” (4.) “If the jury believe the evidence, they should find the defendant not guilty.” The second charge refused to the defendant being admitted to have been properly refused, is not set out. There were verdict and judgment for the plaintiff. The defendant ap peals and assigns as error the several rulings of the trial court, to which exceptions were reserved. L. H. & E. W. Faith, for appellant. The court erred in allowing appellee to ask her witness Bart — and allowing his answer to go to the jury — this: “State whether or not the land described in that complaint is included in the land described in that deed?” The question called for a mere conclusion of the witness, and not for such a shorthand rendering of a collection of facts, as is sometimes permissible. — S. & N. R. R. Go. v. Mc-Lendon, 63 Ala. 276; Homes v. Broionlee, 63 Ala. 277; Doe, ex dem. v. Edmondson, 127 Ala. 445. A party to a suit may testify to his open acts and conduct, but not to his undisclosed intentions. — E. T. Vo. & Go. R. R. Go. v. Davis, 91 Ala. 615. Where a person claims a certain body of land described in his deed by section, or section lines, but that deed makes no- mention of the number of acres, it may be competent to show the number of acres contained in the land described to show the quantity claimed, but it would not, we apprehend, be permissible to show by the oral testimony of a party to the suit that he claimed a certain number of acres to define the quantity of land embraced in the deed, or to locate or describe the land in suit. — Garter v. Beck, 40 Ala. 599; Hodges v. Denny,. 86 Ala. 229.

The court erred in not allowing the defendant to introduce in evidence as color of title under which the defendant claimed the land, the deeds from Cuthbert to Ignard, the judgment and execution against Ignard in the levy and sale, and sheriff’s deeds thereunder to Pow ers, and the deed from Powers to Dorian. The fact that there was uncertainty in the description of -land in any of these instruments offered in evidence, was not sufficient to authorize their exclusion. Where a land described in a deed may, by search and inquiry, be located, the deed is admissible in evidence as •color of title. — Black v. Pratt Goal Go., 85 Ala. 510; Black v. Tcnn.

Were it conceded appellee had prior possession, still the burden was on her to prove that Dorian was a trespasser to entitle her to recover the land from him. Alexander v. Savage, 90 Ala. 383; Gist v. Beaumont, 104 Ala. 352; Adeems v. Pearson, 129 Ala. 157, 167,168. So, therefore, the facts, we respectfully submit, showed affirmatively that Dorian was not a mere naked trespasser, and not being a trespasser, appellee was not entitled to recover upon her mere claim of prior possession, but should have been put to proof of her legal title, which the record shows she never had and never pretended to have.\\' — Braclshano v. Emory, 65 Ala. 208; Bernheim v. Horton, 103 Ala. 394; Jernigan v. Flowers, •94 Ala. 508. Adverse possession of land does not necessarily mean that the land must be enclosed, or built upon. There may be marks or indicia denoting an actual possession of land other than that afforded by a fence or other enclosure, or by buildings. — Bell v. Denson, 56 Ala. 444; Doe, ex dem. Hughes v.

If the owner knows of the adverse holding, then it becomes immaterial to prove that such holding was “open and notorious” in a suit between the owner and such adverse holder — Robinson v.

Mr. Bart, being upon the stand, and having been shown to be a competent surveyor, was asked to state, “whether or not the land described in the complaint is included in the land described in the deed?” There was an objection to this question as incompetent, illegal. That the identity of the land in ejectment may be proven by parol was decided in this State at a very early date. — Dare v. Clennon, 72 Ala. 160; Bullock v. Malone, Minor 400; Chambers v. Ring staff, 69 Ala. 140. It was permissible for .the plaintiff as a witness to testify how much land she was claiming to own under the deed executed to her by Rose. A claim to land is one of the elements of adverse possession. — Baker v. Baker, 108 Ala. 635. The deed of the probate judge which was introduced in evidence, although not acknowledged, was admissible as color of title. This would have been true, even without record, although it was, in fact, recorded, as appears from the certificate thereon. — Redwick v. Long, 124 Ala. 260; Ala. State Land Co. v. Kyle, 99 Ala. 474; Higdon v. Kennemer, 112 Ala. 351. The second objection to the introduction of this tax deed in evidence as a color of title, upon the ground that the plaintiff could not recover since she was only a tenant in common holding an undivided one-half interest, was certainly not well taken. It will be observed that the question as to what interest one tenant in common owning an undivided- interest can recover against an entire stranger to the title is not presented in this case. We see no just reason why a tenant-in common owning an undivided interest which entitles him to the possession of the whole property should not, as against a stranger to the title, recover the entire property, and this seems to be the generally accepted theory. Sedgwick and Wait on Trial of Title to Land, § 300, and a. large number of cases will be found collated in the note. The deed from Outhbert to Ignard, and the other record evidence, sought to be introduced by the defendant, were mot admissible. Outhbert, the grantor, had no possession and no title. His deeds could, therefore, have conferred no title upon Ignard, and being void for un certainty, were not admissible as a color of title. — Black v. ii. R., 93 Ala. 109\\' It. It. Co. v.

A written lease for a definite time merges an oral lease, entered into at the same time and as a part of the same transaction, for an additional year. 2 ESTOPPEL: Equitable Estoppel — Silence. It is only a misleading silence that will work an estoppel. PRINCIPLE APPLIED: A tenant claimed that, at the time a written lease for a definite period was signed, and as a part of the same transaction, an oral lease was made for one year in addition to the written lease. Near the expiration of the written lease, he asserted his right under this oral lease, but proposed to waive it if given a lease for two years at an increased rental for both years. The owner said that he would consult another joint owner and would let the tenant know. The owner did not do so. The tenant wrote several letters to the owners with reference to the matter. The owners ignored the letters. On this silence, the tenant did fall plowing and built a fence. Held, the owners were not estopped to question the legality of the oral lease, especially when there was no showing that the owners knew that the tenant was proposing to or was doing plowing or building a fence.

From Marion : George H. Burnett, Judge. This is an action by Sam H. Brown to recover from the Southern Pacific Company the damages caused by the killing of four of plaintiff’s cows by one of defendant’s locomotives. The negligence alleged as constituting the cause of action is defendant’s failure to place gates or bars at the intersection of its right of way with a private road crossing a farm cultivated by plaintiff, in consequence of which said cows got upon the track and were killed. The answer, after denying the material allegations of the complaint, avers that on November 10, 1870, Samuel Brown and Elizabeth Brown, his wife, executed a deed to the Oregon & California Railroad Company, a corporation, conveying a strip of land sixty feet in width across said farm, and therein covenanted with said corporation, its successors and assigns, to build and maintain a fence on each side of the railroad to be built through said premises ; that said deed was duly recorded in the records of Marion County on November 11, 1870, and plaintiff had full notice and knowledge thereof ; that defendant is the lessee of said corporation, and successor in interest of its right of way and of said covenant; that plaintiff is the son and successor in interest of Samuel Brown, and as such used and occupied said farm, and the private crossing thereon, subject to said covenant; that said cows got upon defendant’s track at said crossing by reason of plaintiff’s failure to place gates or bars thereat, and were killed without any fault upon defendant’s part. The reply having put in issue the allegations of new matter contained in the answer, a trial was had, in which the jury, in pursuance of the court’s instructions, returned a verdict for the defendant, and, a judgment having been rendered thereon, plaintiff appeals.

Quieting Title — Plea Held Insufficient to Show Title Claimed by Defendant. 5. In an action to quiet title, wherein plaintiff claimed to have been in continuous adverse possession of the land for 43 years, and wherein the defendant had the opportunity of showing that she held merely an estate in remainder not accruing until after the death of a certain person, her plea claiming some title and estate, but not asserting that her claim was .well founded, was insufficient, as a party who would rely upon any particular estaté must plead it, since the end and office of such an action is to. call on defendant to assert whatever title he has so that it may be adjudicated. Quieting Title — Distinction Between “Action to Quiet Title” and “Action to Remove Cloud” on Title Stated. 6. An “action to quiet title,” wherein plaintiff asserts his own estate and declares generally that defendant claims some estate in the land, without defining it, and avers that the claim is without foundation, and calls on defendant to set forth the nature of liis claim, so that it may be determined by decree, differs from a “suit to remove a cloud,” in that plaintiff therein declares on his own title, and also avers the source and nature of defendant’s claim, points out its defect, and prays that it may be declared void as a cloud on plaintiff’s estate. Equity — Denial of Rehearing Held not an Abuse of Discretion, 7. After a decree for plaintiffs in an action to quiet title, it was within the trial court’s discretion to refuse to open the case and grant a further hearing merely to allow a third person to deny that he had employed one as attorney, though plaintiff had testified that he had. had an interview with such attorney, whom he had addressed as the attorney for such other person. From Marion: George G. Bingham, Judge. Department 1. The plaintiffs claim that they are now and for forty-three years last past have been the owners in fee simple of a tract of land in Marion County, and have been in the open, notorious, exclusive, and adverse possession of said premises for forty-three years next prior to the commencement of this suit; that the defendant claims some right, title and estate in the property, which claim is without right, and that she has no title whatsoever to the land or any part thereof. The prayer is for the decree usual in suits to quiet title. The answer is as follows: “Defendant, for her answer to plaintiffs’ complaint on file herein, admits that she claims some right, title, and estate in the real property described in plaintiffs’ complaint. Except as herein admitted, defendant denies each and every allegation set forth and contained in said complaint and the whole thereof.” The Circuit Court entered a decree to the effect that the plaintiffs are the owners in fee simple and entitled to the possession of the premises, and that their title should be quieted against the defendant and all parties claiming under her.

A walk constructed of artificial stone ran from the street along the northerly side of B.’s house to a side door and to the back part of the house, in such a position that the boundary line of his lot as described in the will ran longitudinally through the walk, one foot in width of the stone being on B.’s side of the line and two feet on C.’s side. There was also a paved driveway leading back from the street to a barn on C.’s property in such a position that the northerly side of the driveway was twenty-six feet distant from the line described in the will. B.’s house was built by A., who was his father-in-law, and had been occupied ever since by B. and his family.

That statute is imperative in its terms against the railroad companies. No doubt about -the terms of it unless the -owner -of the fence lines or the fence on the line release-the railroad company. My attention has been called in this case to this paper, which purports to be, and is, a deed from H. P. Anderson and Emma D. Anderson to -the Atlantic Coast Rine Railway Company of South Carolina. It is a deed to a strip of land 130 feet wide and 2,573 feet l°ng> more or less, in fee simple, it is a sale out and out, just as any one would sell. It is the form, as our statute says, to convey -title; it is not the right of way to the railroad company, but it is one of the title to the land, that does convey the title in fee simple, and Mrs. Anderson, according to the terms here, renounced her dower, and by the terms of that writing the title passed to the railroad company, and that carried the responsibility to maintain cattle guards, unless there was, as I said, an agreement outside to release the railroad company. We have condemnation laws and we have modes of obtaining rights of way. Condemnation does not mean a right to the land, it is a right to pass over the land. The State passes it by what is called its right of eminent domain to go through land, and when they undertake to get that they must get the right of way — not the land, necessarily, but the right to pass, under what we call an easement to construct tracks, to construct side tracks and depots and all structures necessary to run that railroad; that’s what an easement is, that’s what it means. Now, if they buy the fee simple to the land, it is a different thing; they own it and they can sell it. Where simply the right of way is given or leased to them, released, just simply an easement — no doubt about where they condemn the land or get an ordinary lease, or release, I don’t know which it is termed, but you know what I mean, it is called either, I believe — where they get an ordinary lease to build it is their duty to build, ordinarily to build cattle guards, stock guards or cattle gaps, that’s imperative, they must fix up the cattle gap or stock guard so that cattle can’t get into your field. And as I take it, the fence line or line of fence owner would \\'be entitled to recover for every fence or line of fence crossed. \\'Suppose the railroad bought 10,000 acres and it crossed fifty fences, I charge you they are not bound to construct stock guards there, on their own land; the legislature don’t mean that, that they are to construct stock guards on their own land, unless there are other circumstances in the case that theré is an implied understanding or a direct understanding that they are to sustain to each other, the company and the owner, the same relationship as if it was condemned, then it would be to construct cattle guards, I charge you that this don’t mean that. J know that counsel for plaintiff quoted authority in a Missouri case — and that’s law in that State — -and generally on statutes something like this it has been so held, that’s why the court of last resort said it makes no difference whether they owned a fee or an easement, and we can’t be governed by the decisions of other States; if counsel said he read the statute and it was like ours, that’s sufficient. Did the defendant company purchase the fee simple title ? If so, it is his land and fences. So far as the terms of this deed is concerned, there is nothing for that here. I don’t — I merely speak of it — I don’t say it is in evidence. I can’t speak of anything in evidence. If I did, I could explain the law much easier. Thun again, so far as the evidence goes, did the circumstances show that the defendant owned property around there ? How did the parties trade ? Do the circum stances show the relation was to remain the same as if the owner conveyed the fee simple, or the same as if he had conveyed only an easement ? If the circumstances showed that, then they are bound to put in ’the cattle guard; if they did not, then they are not bound to do it. That’s my construction of the statute. Then the question arises, when must they construct the cattle guard ? My understanding is, the spirit of the statute is, that -they must do it in a reasonable time. They must do it when they build the road, it is a part of the road, or as soon as it can be done in reason; they can’t do it by electricity, they must do it in a reasonable time, and the jury must say what is a reasonable time. And after that reasonable time has passed, an action may be brought. I don’t know if you understand all that, if you become confused, come out and ask about it. “Now, so far as the requests to charge. First, the defendant requests this: ‘That the deed of the plaintiff and wife to the defendant company, conveying, as it does, a fee simple title to the land in question, and not a mere right of way, there is no obligation upon the defendant to construct cattle guards upon the said land.’ I charge you that, unless you find, as I have said, that from all the facts and circumstances there was an understanding between them that the defendant was not to take advantage of his possession of fee simple title, if you find \\'he bought it; but the relation between the plaintiff and defendant was to be as if only an easement was granted. II. ‘That the statute under which this action is brought requires that there shall not only be a fence, where the railroad crosses, but that the plaintiff in the action shall be the owner of such fence, and the plaintiff cannot be the owner of a fence upon the defendant’s land.’ I charge you that, with the same qualification that I have added to the other request. If you find that the plaintiff and defendant had an understanding between them, if there is anything to show it — that the plaintiff was to maintain his line across there and the defendant relinquished any right he might have, if he-\\'bought such a title — then I charge you that’s the law, that this request is the law. * * * “The plaintiff’s requests, coming last, are as follows : * * * “II. That the term Tattle guard,’ as used in the statute, has a legal meaning, and is defined to mean “such an appliance as will prevent animals from going upon the land adjoining the right of way;” that a mere pit under the track is not sufficient, \\'but the appliance must extend to the outer limit of the right of way; and if the jury find from the preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant’s railroad crossed the line of plaintiff’s fence, in one or more places, and that the railroad company has failed to construct cattle guards such as already defined, then your verdict should be for the plaintiff.’ Well, in the first place, cattle guard is not used in the statute at all, I might refuse -the request on that ground. The statute says— “Mr. Izlar: I didn’t have the statute before me, I will substitute the words in the statute. “The Court: I don’t care to be so particular as that; I have said already that I consider cattle guard has a legal meaning, I consider that it says in the statute stock guard or cattle pit; I think that has a legal meaning as stated here, and that it means such an appliance as will prevent animals from going upon the land adjoining the right of way. I think that, under our statute, it is not bound to .extend to the outer edge of the right of way, but only so far as is necessary for its trains to pass, or rather for the land owner to bring his fences up to allow the trains to pass, bring up his fences on each side of the rail, the iron, as will be safe; he mustn’t bring it up to the iron, because the owner can’t come up to the track, the iron; therefore, they must go far enough to make it safe. But I do not think it -is the law in our State to go all the way across the whole hundred and thirty feet, or whatever it may be. We are bound to use the rule of common sense, as counsel invoked. With that qualification, I charge you that. * * *” From verdict and judgment for defendant, plaintiff appeals on the following grounds: “ist. That the Circuit Judge, Hon. D. A. Townsend, erred in holding, and so charged the jury at the trial of said cause, that where the railroad company acquires a right of way through the lands of the owner, \\'by purchase and conveyance in fee simple, and not by condemnation proceedings under the statute, it is is not bound to construct and keep in repair an adequate stock gxtard or cattle gap at every point where the line of such railroad crosses the line of any fence of the land owner executing such conveyances; unless there was an understanding, expressed or implied, that the land owner and the railroad company shall sustain the same relationship as if the said right of way had been condemned; whereas, he should have charged, that the language of the statute being\" imperative, it made no difference whether the-right of way was acquired by purchase and conveyance or b;y condemnation, whether a fee simple or an easement, the railroad company was bound to construct and keep in repair an adequate stock guard or cattle gap at any point where the line of the railroad crosses the line of any fence in the State; and failing so to do, it would be liable to pay to owner or to the owners of the fence upon the line of which such stock guard or cattle gap should have been constructed and kept in repair, the sum of $100 to be recovered by action in the Court of Common Pleas for the county in which such stock guard or cattle gap should have been constructed and kept in repair. “2d. That the Circuit Judge erred in his interpretation of the statute in regard to- the construction and repair of stock guards and cattle gaps, by holding that the statute only applies in cases where the railroad company acquires the right of way by condemnation, and not where it acquires the right of way by conveyance and purchase in fee, and in charging the jury that there is a difference under the statute, whether the railroad company owns the fee in the right of way, or only an easement, as to its liability. “3d. That the Circuit Judge erred in his-construction of the statute and in his charging the jury as follows: \\'How did the parties trade ? Do the circumstances show that the relation was to remain the same as if the owner conveyed the fee simple, or the same as if he had conveyed only an easement? If the circumstances -showed that, then they are bound to put in -the cattle guard; if they did not, then they are not bound to do it. That’s my construction of the statute.’ Whereas, he should have construed the statute as applying in all cases, whether the right of way was acquired by conveyance in fee simple or by condemnation proceedings, and only amounted to an easement, and should have so charged the jury. “4th. That the Circuit Judge erred in charging the defendant’s first request: ‘That the deed of the plaintiff and wife to the defendant company, conveying as it does a fee simple title to the land in question and not a mere right of way, there is no obligation upon the defendant to construct cattle guards upon said lands, even when modified as follows : I charge you that, unless you find, as I have said, that from all the facts and circumstances, there was an understanding -between them, that the defendant was not to take advantage of his possession of the fee simple title, if you find he bought it; but the relation between the plaintiff and the defendant was to be as if only an easement was granted. Whereas, he should have charged that the obligation upon the defendant to construct stock guards or cattle gaps; under the statute, was the same whether the defendant acquired a fee simple in the right of way, under the deed or only as an easement therein. “5th. That the Circuit Judge erred in charging the second request of the defendant even as modified, the same being as follows: ‘That the statute under which this action is brought requires that there shall not only be a fence where the railroad crosses, but the plaintiff in the action shall be the owner of the fence, and the plaintiff cannot be an owner of the fence upon the defendant’s land. I charge you with the same qualification that I have added to the other request. If you find that the plaintiff and the defendant had an understanding \\'between them, if there is anything -to show it, that the plaintiff was to maintain his line across there and the defendant relinquished any right he might have, if he bought such a title, then I charge you that’s the law, that this request is the law.’ The said proposition of law being unsound even as fnodified, and was calculated to mislead the j ury, as to a true construction of the statute. “6th. That the Circuit Judge erred in not charging the plaintiff’s second request, as follows : ‘That the term “cattle guard,” as used in the statute, has a legal meaning, and is defined to mean such appliance as will prevent animals from going upon the land adjoining the right of way; that a mere pit under the track is not sufficient, but that the appliance must extend to the outer limit of the right of way; and if the jury find from the preponderance of the evidence that the defendant’s railroad crossed the line of the plaintiff’s fence, in one or more places, and that the railroad has failed to construct cattle guards, such as already defined, then your verdict should be for the plaintiff.’ And in charging the jury thereon as follows: T have said already that I considered cattle guard has a legal meaning, I consider that it says in the statute, stock guard or cattle pit; I think that has\\' a legal meaning, as stated here, and that it means, such an appliance as will prevent animals from going upon the land adjoining the right of way. I think that, under our statute, it is not bound to extend to the outer edge of the right of way, but so far as it is necessary for its trains to pass, or rather for the land owner to bring his fence up to allow the train to pass, bring up his fences on each side of the rail, or the iron, as will be safe; he must not bring it up to the iron, because the owner cannot come up to- the track, the iron; therefore, he must go far enough to make it safe. But I do not think it is the law in our State to go all the way across the whole one hundred and thirty feet, or one hundred feet, or whatever it may be, we are \\'bound to use the rule of common sense, as counsel invoked, with that qualification, I charge you that.’ “7th. That the Circuit Judge erred in holding that no liability attached to railroad companies for a violation of the provisions of sections 1729 and 1730 of the Revised Statutes of 1893, in regard to the stock guards and cattle gaps, where the railroad company acquired its right of way by grant or conveyance in fee simple, but only where such right of way is acquired by condemnation proceedings, and that there is a difference, under the statute whether the railroad company holds the fee, or only an easement, in the right of way, as to the liability of railroad companies, in failing to construct adequate stock guards or cattle gaps at every point where the line of their railroad crosses, or may hereafter cross the line of any fence in this State; and that where the railroad company holds the fee in the right of -way, they are not bound to construct and maintain stock guards and cattle gaps unless there is an understanding between the land owner and the railroad company, that the railroad company should do so; such construction of the statute being not only unsound and erroneous, but contrary to the true intent and meaning of the makers and framers of the statute.” Messrs. John B. Allen and Izlar Bros., for appellant. The latter cite: Nothing in the statute which limits it to cases of easement: 23 S. C., 550. And it applies in cases of absolute deeds: 16 N.

The testatrix devised to her three grandnieces “my three (3) unimproved lots lying next to the corner of C. & M. streets in the city of Shreveport.” Afterwards she executed ■a document reciting; “To prevent any trouble in regard to my will I wish to state * * * that I do will and bequeath unto my three grandnieces three lots owned by me with all the improvements thereon.

The lot at the middle of the block was an improved lot, which had been her home during the entire time of her married life of 20 years, and of her residence in Shreveport; and she was in the habit of referring to it, both before and after making the will, as her home place, whereas she would refer to her holding at the corner as the lots at the corner, and, after making the will, as the property given to her grandnieces.

Where in ejectment brought on a theory of adverse possession of a triangular piece of land adjacent to plaintiff’s lot, the evidence was conflicting as to the intention with which the fence between the property of plaintiff and defendant was erected and as to whether defendant intended to hold to the fence whether it was on the true line or not, and as to whether such line had been agreed upon, it was not error to refuse affirmative charges requested by defendant.

Statement of the case by Woods, Judge : On the 28th of February, 1885, J. S. Miller presented to the judge of the Circuir Court of Logan county in vacation his bill, verified by his affidavit, against Guy M. Dingess and the town of Aracoma, alleging substantially the following facts : That on the 12th of January, 1880, he purchased from one Ellis a house and parcel of land containing about half an acre, situated within the village of Logan Court House, and wifhin the limits of the town of Aracoma, which was duly incorporated by the Circuit Court of said county, at the spring term thereof, 1884; that this land had been purchased by Ellis on the 9th of February, 1871,-from one Floyd, who had purchased the same with other lands from one Lawson; that at the time Lawson purchased the same, and long prior thereto, said parcel of land had been inclosed with a fence, and used by Lawson as his residence, and that said fence remained after the sale of the land to Ellis, to whom Floyd had pointed it out as the- boundaries of the land so sold to him; that the title-bond executed by Floyd to Ellis for sale of said land, recognized the existence of a town-plat, then lately made by Floyd, on which the land so sold to Ellis was marked as lots “A” and “B,” which were the first lots sold by Floyd after making the addition to the village of Logan Court House, called the “New Flan of Aracoma;” that it was at first the intention of Floyd in making the addition to the town to have an alley between the lots sold to Ellis, which have since been numbered 2á and 25, respectively; but that Floyd then abandoned that intention, and by his title-bond to Ellis sold him both lots and the alley between them, making 212 feet front; and that there never has been any claim on the part of any one that any alley was ever made, laid off, or dedicated to the public on the upper end of his property; and that his inclosure covers only what was always claimed by Ellis under his title-bond, and which has been in his possession and the possession of the plaintiff- ever since the purchase thereof by Ellis from Floyd. He further alleges' that within the last two years the defendant, Dingess, purchased from Floyd a lot adjoining plaintiff’s lots on the upper side thereof, and he now claims that there has been, and is an alley between his lots and plaintiff’s lots, which, as Dingess claims is in the possession and within the inclosure of the plaintiff, which alley, he further claims, was dedicated by Floyd to the public; whereas the plaintiff avers that no such dedication was ever made either by grant or by public use, and that no alley has ever been claimed or used by the public at large, either within the inclosnre of the plaintiff, or between his inclosure and the lot now owned by Dingess, and that no such alley as the one now claimed by him was originally shown on Floyd’s plat of the town. The bill further alleges that the plaintiff and his vendor, Ellis, have been, since the 9th day of February, 1871, in peaceable and quiet possession of the ground over which Dingess claims this easement, under and by virtue of the title-bond to Ellis, claiming title to every portion of the premises inclosed by his fence, which constitutes a legal bar to any action or proceeding to dispossess him. of any part of his premises. The bill further alleged that the common’ council of the town of Aracoma being moved thereto by Dingess, without any right or authority to take any part of the .plaintiff’s said property for public use, by its order passed on the 11th of February, 1885, ordered the plaintiff to remove his inclosure, and open the alley, as claimed by Din-gess, to the public use, on or before the 3d of March, 1885J which he refused to do; whereupon the common council, at a meeting thereof on the - day of February, 1885, adopted the following order: “It appearing that J. S. Miller has refused and neglected to open the alley fenced up by him between his lots and the lots of G. M. Dingess, as was ordered by this council at a meeting held on the 3d of January, 1885, it is ordered that the superintendent of roads, streets, and alleys do cause the same to be opened for public travel.” The plaintiff thereupon prayed that an injunction be awarded enjoining the' defendants and each of them from trespassing upon or removing his said inclosure, or attempting to locate said alley on his premises, and for general relief. A preliminary injunction was allowed as prayed for, which was made effectual by the execution of the bond required by the order of the judge. Process was executed on the town of Aracoma by delivering a copy thereof to its mayor, J. R Perry, who filed his answer under oath to the bill, to which the plaintiff replied generally. Omitting the formal portions thereof, the material -parts of the answer of Perry, mayor of the town of Aracoma, were as follows: “ Respondent has no interest in this matter, and all he has had to do with anything in the matters com: plained of in the plaintiff’s bill, was as a member of the town authorities. He admits that the plaintiff bought of Ellis, and Ellis of Floyd, and Floyd of Lawson; but he avers that Lawson did not use this property as a residence, and the plat and the map of the town referred to b.y the plaintiff in his bill shows an alley on its face between lots Nos. 23 and 24, and he charges that the plaintiff moved the fence, and took in the alley in controversy.” The defendant, Dingess, also answered the bill under oath, to which answer the plaintiff replied generally. This answer admits that the plaintiff, and those under whom he claims, derived, title tc the laud at the times and in the manner stated in the bill; that these lots were the first sold by Floyd after he made the plat of Aracoma, and that the lots sold to Ellis were marked thereon at the time he purchased them from Floyd, and that respondént bought his lot No. 23, adjoining the lots of the plaintiff on the 8th day of February, 1885, and that he claims that there is and was an alley between said named two lots, and that he has induced the common council of Aracoma to open such alley. Respondent denies that Lawson used this property owned by the plaintiff as a homestead, and he can not say how much was inclosed; neither does he know whether Floyd showed Ellis where to build his fence, but he avers that the plaintiff, instead of 212 feet, has 275 feet fronting on Dingess street, and that plaintiff’s inclosure now includes a considerable part of the lot now occupied by this respondent, and that there is an alley on the plat between respondent’s lot and the lots of the plaintiff running at right angles from Dingess street to the river; nor is it true that the plaintiff’s inclosure covers only what was claimed by Ellis, or what was fenced in by him; nor that all of the alley has been fenced up, until within the last year or two. Respondent charges that the fences made by Ellis were made when he went into possession of the lots but they were mere shifts, and not made on any of the lines of said town-lots, nor did they ever run parallel'with any of the boundary lines of either of the lots, the street, or the river, and if they had, they have been moved by the plaintiff, or taken down and re-built. And he ■further avers that there is on the plaintiff’s lot No. 24 what he calls a stable, — a mere thing of round poles, which is neither square nor plumb, which fronts on neither street, alley, nor river. Respondent made part of his answer the title bond executed to him for the sale of lot No. 23, dated February 8,1885, which describes the same “ One town-lot, in Floyd’s addition to the town of Aracoma, at Logan Court House, W. Va., situated on Dingess street, fronting one hundred feet thereon and running back to the Guyan river, adjoining on the southeast side the lot of James M. French, and on the northeast side a twelve foot alley, on the south west side of the Simpson Ellis lot, where J. S. Miller now lives.” The depositions of the plaintiff and of the vendor, Simpson Ellis, were taken on behalf of the plaintiff; and the depositions of said J. R. Perry and one Dejermatt were taken on behalf of the defendants, and no other witnesses were examined. In addition to the depositions, the title-bond from Floyd to Simpson Ellis, and a plat purporting to be the plat of the town of Aracoma, were filed as evidence in the cause. On the 15th of October, 1885, the cause was heard, and the following decree was entered: “ This cause came on this 15th day of October, 1885, to be finally heard on the plaintiff’s bill, and the exhibits filed therewith, and the answers of the defendants, and the replication thereto, and the depositions of witnesses, and the plat of the town of Aracoma, and the title-bond of G. R. 0. Floyd to Simpson Ellis, under which the plaintiff claims his right, and was argued by counsel; and the court is of opinion that there was an alley, as shown in said town-plat, between Guy M. Dingess’s lot No. 23 and said plaintiff’s lot No. 24, which formed a part of plan of the town which was considered by said Dingess in the purchase of his lot as a matter of convenience, and entered into the consideration of his purchase. And the court being of the further opinion that, by reason of said town-plat, the said alley of 12 feet width was dedicated to public use, and should be so held and preserved, it is therefore adjudged, ordered-, and decreed that the injunction heretofore granted the plaintiff enjoining the defendant, Guy M. Dingess, and the authorities of the town of Aracoma, from proceeding to open said alley, be, and the same is hereby, dissolved, leaving the said authorities to take such steps as they may deem proper to open said alley in accordance with the plat of the said town. And it is further adjudged that the defendants recover their costs against the plaintiff in this cause expended, including the $15.00 allowed by statute, and this cause is stricken from the docket.” From this decree the plaintiff has appealed to this Court. Five grounds of error have been assigned by him, which may be readily reduced to two: First, in regarding the answer of J. R. Perry, mayor of the town of Aracoma, as the answer of the defendant, “ the town of Ara- coma; ” second, in dissolving the injunction, and dismissing the bill. J. A. Bing for appellant.

       "  'case_summary': \"Bodine v. Wayne Title & Trust Company, Appellant. Conveyancers — Negligence—Damages—Searches—Covenant to fence. Where a title insurance company agrees as a conveyancer to examine title to land, and see that it is clear and free of all incumbrances, and by a separate contract in writing at a different date it insures the title, and it appears that the company negligently overlooked an incumbrance on the land created by the deed of a former owner, suit may be brought immediately upon the breach by the person injured against the company for the negligent performance of its professional duty as a conveyancer, and the question of the company’s liability under its title policy is not in the case. In an action against a conveyancer to recover damages for a loss resulting from negligence in overlooking a covenant' in a deed in the line of title by which the owner of the land was bound to erect and perpetually maintain a fence along a railroad company’s right of way, the measure of damages is the-actual cost of the fence, and such gross sum as will produce annually the amount it will cost annually to maintain the fence and keep it in repair. Argued Dec. 11, 1906. Appeal, No. 170, Oct. T., 1906, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. No. 3, Phila. Co., Dec. T., 1904, No. 1,618, on verdict for plaintiff in case of S. Lawrence Bodine v. Wayne Title & Trust Company. Before Rice, P. J., Porter, Henderson, Morrison, Orlady, Head and Beaver, JJ. Affirmed. Trespass to recover damages for loss resulting from the negligence of the defendant as a conveyancer. Before McMichael, J. The facts are stated in the opinion of the Superior Court. At the trial the court charged as follows : The cases in Pennsylvania have gone so far as to say in the alternative case, where the railroad company sues on its covenant, that what it is entitled to recover in a case of this kind is the cost of the fence and the cost of maintenance. That testimonjr is to a certain extent positive. You heard the witnesses. They differed somewhat in their estimates according to locality and according to their own experience. But still, while one of us, I know, is not a farmer and does not know much about fencing, we know more than we did before we opened this case, and you have testimony of what the cost is. Then we come to two matters, one of which was a matter of evidence and the other a matter of argument, but they are very interesting and they are matters which science will not solve but common sense may, and it is for you. [One is the argument, supported by evidence of the plaintiff, who says he is damaged more than the cost of the fence and the cost of maintenance, because the fence, according to the testimony, is only going to last fifteen years, and when he is through that fifteen years he will have to erect another, and he says, therefore, he should have a principal sum, which he gave you, which at interest, so much a year to be earned on that principal sum, will at the end of fifteen years enable him to go on with the fencing. I think the evidence was admissible and it is for you to determine whether the argument is properly drawn from that testimony. It is for you to draw the inference.] [11] On the other hand, defendant’s counsel argued, supported by evidence, partly by the cross-examination of the plaintiff’s witnesses and partly by the evidence of his own witnesses, that this was a farm and used for farm purposes, and he argued, with how much persuasiveness I do not know, but he argued that if this land was used as farm land, the plaintiff would need the fences anyhow, that he could not let his cattle be in there without having fences to turn the cattle, and that after all, tliifc which is called a charge or incumbrance was nothing at- all, that the plaintiff would have to do it anyhow. Now, gentlemen of the jury, I shall leave the case with you, except for the answers to points, which I can only explain in this way, that a judge has not only to charge the jury on the evidence — and however much he may wish to let them go with a- blessing, like the preacher, he must preach the sermon — but he must also answer any hypothetical points which, in the opinion of counsel, touch the case. But I think I have brought to your attention the questions which you are to decide by a common-sense consideration of the evidence. The salient question of fact, was the defendant company careless ? Second, if it was, what did the plaintiff suffer ? What was his loss ? And with that I shall leave the case with you, after charging you on the points as submitted. [A Juror; May I ask your honor a question? I am interested in this, because I have considerable business of this kind myself. The Court: Yes. The J uror: As I understand it, the defendant gave a policy of insurance. How does that affect the liability ? The Court: It does not affect it at all in my judgment. In ' my opinion — and you will take the law from me, subject to review hereafter — the policy of insurance, which was excluded, does not affect the question here. It is a very interesting and sensible question, and I am glad you asked it. But, subject to review hereafter, the policy of insurance, which is a contract to indemnify the plaintiff, does not affect the question here. Here the plaintiff sues, as he has a right to sue, for the loss he suffered by the tort or wrong done by the defendant, and in my opinion, the policy of insurance has no bearing, except as it is part of the history of the case. He brings his suit for the loss which he suffered through the carelessness of the defendant company, which he employed and paid as a conveyancer to look up his title and get his searches and so on. The policy of insurance is a contract. Now, how far he might recover on that I do not know, I have not examined into it. How far he might, as was argued at length by counsel for the defendant, defalk against the mortgage is a matter depending on other considerations than we have here. I am glad the juror, who interested me very much before by his intelligent questions to counsel, asked me that question, because I can give my view, which is subject to review hereafter.] [7] Defendant presented these points : 2. By the terms of the deed from William C. Latch to S. Lawrence Bodine, the property was conveyed freed from incumbrance done or suffered by Latch. Bodine, therefore, has a right of action against Latch for any damage which he has sustained by reason of the breach of this covenant, and there can be no recovery against the defendant in this case until Bodine has exhausted his remedy against Latch. Answer: Declined. [1] The plaintiff’s remedy in this case is primarily against Latch, his grantor, for breach of. covenant, and there can be no recovery against the defendant until the plaintiff has exhausted his remed}1, against the grantor. Answer : Declined. [2] 11. The title insurance policy issued by the defendant and accepted by the plaintiff covers the terms of the contract and undertaking between them, and there can bé no recovery in this case; suit should have been brought on the title policy. Answer: Declined. [4] 12. Under all the evidence the verdict should be for the defendant. Answer: Declined. [5] Verdict for plaintiff for $1,851, upon which judgment was entered for $951, all above that amount having been remitted. Defendant appealed. Errors assigned among others were (1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 11) above instructions, quoting them. V. Gilpin Robinson, with him Frederick B.

Howell and Francis L. Howell v. Thomas Mellon, W. L. Scott and the Youghiogheny River Coal Company. Parol sales of real estate — Parol partition — Evidence—Gharge of court upon testimony— Question for jury. A., by his last will and testament, devised the use of his farm to his widow, until the youngest child should become of age, and directed that it should then be sold. He gave to his widow the right to elect whether the sale should take place at the time designated by him or not until her death. She elected that it should remain unsold until her death. Nine children survived the testator, and they elected to take the farm as realty. Ejectment was brought by the children of J., one of the sons of the testator, who claimed title as the devisees of L., another of the sons of the testator. In support of their title the plaintiffs relied upon parol sales alleged to have been made in 1836 and 1837 by the children of the testator to their three brothers, J., L. and P., and a subsequent parol partition by which the land in controversy became the property of L., under whom they claimed to have the title. The defendants asserted title under J., the father of the plaintiffs, who claimed to be the owner of seven eighths of the land as heir at law, and as the vendee of six other heirs at law of the testator, and by whom conveyances of their title were made. The defendants had been in possession of the land claiming title for forty years, and plaintiffs were asserting an equitable title, of which the only evidence of a parol contract was to be gathered from the declarations of the parties to strangers, there being an entire absence of any proof of parol contract made between the plaintiffs and the other heirs for a purchase of their interest or shares in said land at an agreed price, except the interest of L., which was the undivided one eighth part, and the undivided one third of the shares of S. and M., two of the daughters of the testator, which became vested in L., whose title the plaintiffs held. There was also no direct proof of the parol partition, and the evidence of such partition having been made, was to be gathered from declarations of the parties, and was wanting in definiteness and certainty. The trial judge instructed the jury that if the testimony of plaintiff was believed, it was sufficient to establish the parol sale and the parol partition. . Held, to be error in that the charge under the evidence was insufficient, as it left to the jury only the question.of the credibility of the witnesses. The court should have directed the attention of the jury to the vague and uncertain character of the testimony, and if they failed to find from the weight of the whole evidence that such agreements were made as claimed by the plaintiffs, then the plaintiffs could only recover the one undivided one eighth and the one undivided one third of the shares of S. and M., from whom they held conveyances. Argued Nov. 5, 1894. Appeal No. 28, Oct. T., 1894, by defendants, from judgment of C. P. No. 2 of Allegheny Co., July T., 1891, No. 666, on a verdict for the plaintiff. Before Sterrett, C. J., Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ. Reversed. Equitable ejectment for a tract of coal land situate in Elizabeth township, Allegheny county, containing 64.68 acres. Before Ewing, P. J. The material facts of this case will be found in the charge of the trial judge and in the opinion of the Supreme Court. Llewellyn Howell, Sr., died in 1823, seized of a large tract of land, of which the tract in controversy is a part, leaving to survive him his widow, Mary, and nine children : John, Llewellyn, Andrew, Philip, James, Sarah, Martha, Esther and Mary. The material part of his will is as follows: “ I demise and bequeath unto my loveing wife Mary, all my household furniture, likewise all my personal property except the stills and appendages which my son Lew Ellen is to have the use of the one equal half, all of which is to be kept or disposed of at the discretion of my Executors for the use of herself and family during state of her widowhood as likewise the use of the farm until my son James .arrives at the age of twenty-one years. Except such property as has been named to my children yet at home by me at which time the place is to be sold by my Executors and the two thirds of the proceeds to be equally devided to and amongst my heirs and the one third to be at intrist foor the use of my Sd. wife, but if in the opinion of my said wife such sale would be prejudicial to her intrist she may detain the Sale and possess the land by paying the two thirds of the rent as long as she sees Cause or during state of her widowhood, but if she should mary she only to have an equal part with one of the children, all the surplus property which will be Remaining at the death of my said wife to be sold and the proceeds Equally Divided to and Amongst my children, Together with the proceeds of the land when sold Except what of my children as have already goten property which is to be Considered out of their part.” The widow elected that the farm should not be sold during her widowhood. The plaintiffs claimed that John, Philip and Llewellyn, Jr., had purchased by parol the interests of the other heirs, and elected to treat the property thereafter as realty, and made an amicable partition thereof among themselves; that by virtue of said purchase and partition, Llewellyn, Jr., became seized in fee of a large portion of said tract of land, embracing, inter alia, the property in controversy; that he improved the same and held possession thereof for many years, and up to the time of his death, which occurred in January, 1851, having made a will the material portion of which is as follows: “ I will bequeath unto my brother Andrew Howell the one undivided half parts of the Farm whereon I now reside Embracing and including the buildings for and during his natural life Subject to the payment of the hereinafter bequests and also Subject to Mothers dower. And then I will and devise Same unto his children them their heirs and assigns but in case he the Said Andrew Howell Should die without issue then in that case I will & devise the Same unto my brother John Howells children to them their heirs and assigns Share & Share alike. I will & bequeath unto my brother James Howell the one undivided North half of the farm whereon I now reside Embracing & including the Mill property for and during his natural life Subject to the payment of the hereinafter named bequests and also Subject to Mothers dower and at his death I will & devise the Same unto his children to them their heirs and assigns Share & Share alike. And in consequence of the bequests that T have herein made to Andrew and James Howell I order and direct that they Shall each remise & release unto John & Philip Howell all manner of claim or claims that they may have of in or to the Land whereon the said John & Philip now reside.” They also claimed that Andrew Howell died without issue in May, 1891, and that John Howell died in August, 1894, leaving surviving him the following named children, to wit: Llewellyn, Philip, Margaret, Adley C., Martha, Samuel W., and Frances L., who are the plaintiffs in this case, and entitled to the premises in controversy by virtue of the said will of Llewellyn Howell, Jr. The defendants, on the other hand, claimed that John, one of the children of Llewellyn Howell, Sr., purchased the interests of five of his brothers and sisters in said real estate, viz: Esther, by deed dated 19th of April, 1852; the heirs of Sarah by deed dated 14th of October, 1852; Philip by deed dated Sept. 31, 1852; Martha by deed dated March 12,1853; Andrew by deed dated Sept. 12, 1863 ; and that John thus became seized of six undivided eighth parts or shares, including his own, in said land; and also by the deed of Andrew Howell, he obtained the half of the share of Llewellyn, Jr., who devised his share to Andrew and James; that in an action of ejectment between James and Andrew against John a consentible verdict was rendered, allotting James 50 acres of said land of which Llewellyn, Sr., died seized as and for his share in the will of his father, and half share in the will of his brother Llewellyn, Jr. They further claimed that Mary Howell remained the widow of Llewellyn, Sr., until her death in 1853, retaining possession of the whole farm under the provisions of the will until the marriage of her son John, when she assigned part of it to his use, she retaining the residue and occupying the homestead thereon until her death ; at which time John entered into sole possession of the farm, remaining in exclusive possession until the 50 acres thereof were allotted to his brother James, and thereafter continuing in sole and exclusive possession of the estate and residue thereof until the sale made by him to Thomas Mellon of all the coal and part of the surface of the farm, including the coal in dispute in this case, by a deed dated Aug. 25, 1863; that Thomas Mellon sold the same to William L. Scott, one of the defendants, by a deed dated March 22, 1881. Defendants further alleged that Thomas Mellon, under whom said William L. Scott holds, was a bona fide purchaser in fee from John Howell, the father of the plaintiff, for a valuable consideration, and without any notice or knowledge of the alleged title set up in this suit by the plaintiffs ; and that said Scott was a bona fide purchaser from Mellon for a valuable consideration, without any knowledge of said alleged claim; that the farm of which Llewellyn, Sr., died seized contained less than 150 acres for mining and commercial purposes, and less than 100 acres, exclusive of the 50 acres set apart to James Howell by said action of ejectment. Defendants also denied that John, Philip and Llewellyn, Jr., purchased the interests of the other heirs of Llewellyn, Sr., and made an amicable settlement among themselves, and also that the Youghiogheny River Coal Company holds under said Scott. At the trial plaintiffs offered depositions of old and infirm witnesses to prove that they had heard statements made by the several children of Llewellyn, Sr., that they had sold out their interests to their three brothers, Llewellyn, John and Philip, and statements made by Llewellyn, John and Philip that they had made a parol partition, and that Llewellyn remained in exclusive possession of his purpart under said parol partition up to the time of his death; that John and Llewellyn had pointed out the fence which marked the line between them. All this testimony was objected to; the objections were overruled, and bills sealed for defendants. [1-17] Defendants offered in evidence the will of Mary Howell, to be followed by proof that she claimed to have bought Llewellyn, Jr.’s, interest in the land to counteract testimony of John Woods to the effect that Llewellyn was an owner beyond the extent of his own share under his father’s will; also agreement between James Howell with R. and S. Woods dated November 23, 1854, for his interest in the land; testimony of Thomas Mellon to show that John, vendor, was in possession when Mellon purchased, and the explanations of John to said Mellon regarding the absence of title in writing for Llewellyn, Jr.’s, individual share; testimony of witnesses who were present at the action of ejectment between James and Andrew Howell and John Howell, and the statements and declarations made by the parties themselves on the witness stand. This testimony was objected to by the plaintiffs ; the objection sustained by the court and bill sealed for defendants. [18-22] The court charged the jury as follows : “ The plaintiffs in this case are seven children of John Howell. They claim, not through their father, John Howell, but they claim by virtue of the will of their uncle, Llewellyn Howell, Jr., who died in 1851, and devised land as follows : “ ‘ I will and bequeath unto my brother, Andrew Howell, the undivided one-half part of the farm whereon I now reside, embracing and including the buildings, for and during his natural life, subject to the payment of the hereinafter bequests; and subject to mother’s dower; and then, I will and devise the same unto his children, them, their heirs and assigns; but in case he, the said Andrew Howell, should die without issue, then, in that case, I will and devise the same unto my brother John Howell’s children, to them, their heirs and assigns, share and share alike.’ And then he devises to his brother, ‘ James Howell, the undivided north half of the farm whereon I now reside,’ for his life, and to his children, he to pay some legacies, among them one to John. “ Andrew Howell, the uncle, never had any children, and he died in 1891. The plaintiffs are conceded to be the children of John Howell referred to in the will. Whether or not they were born in 1851, when Llewellyn Howell made his will, is not important. There is no doubt under the evidence that the farm referred to includes in part, at least, the land now in dispute, the sixty-eight acres of coal. It is not in dispute that Llewellyn Howell had lived for a long time and died in the bouse that was then and is now standing on the land, subject of this ejectment. Now, if Llewellyn Howell had no title to that land at the time of his death, his will did not convey any title to these plaintiffs. If he had a good title to it, then these plaintiffs are entitled to it, unless there is something intervening shown to defeat their title and rigid. “ The defendants claim under John Howell, by a conveyance from John Howell, made in 1863, and in the larger portion of this case I wish to treat it as if it was a question between the plaintiffs and John Howell, the father, (there are some other questions that I will discuss separately,) because if the plaintiffs could not recover as against John Howell, they have no shadow of a case against the present defendants ; if they could, then other questions arise. “ The land is a part of a larger tract. Llewellyn Howell, Sr., died, it seems, in 1823, having made his will, by which he devised this land practically to his executors named, with directions to sell when the youngest child arrived at the age of twenty-one, and divide the two thirds of the proceeds among the children, the other one third to remain to his widow for life; but with the provision, also, that his wife might forbid the sale as long as she lived, and hold the land bj»- paying two thirds of the rent to the children. It was in law a conversion of it, and the children did not take it as land at all; they had but an equitable interest in the land as the material from which the legacies were to be paid. It was personal property, and each of the children who was of age could sell his or her interest in it without a deed; or without a writing, even. If one of them bargained to sell his interest to John or Llewellyn or Philip, he could do it, just as if it had been a horse or a cow or money or anything else, and the only difference between there being a writing or not, and the only difference between its being recorded or not, would be the difficulty of proving it; that is all there is in it. It remained personal property and not land, until all the parties having an interest in it at the time agreed to treat it as land. If all but one agreed to treat it as land and the other did not, it still was not land. A conve3rance of it in the form of an interest in the land would be good as an assignment of the interest. The fact that the assignment of the interest of one of the parties is in the form of a deed for land, does not avoid it at all; it is good as an assignment of the claim. “ [Now, we have been asked to say to 3um as a matter of law, that before Mr. Mellon’s purchase in 1863, all the children had agreed to treat it as land. That is a matter of fact for you; the court would have no difficulty in finding that that was the case, still, it is a question of fact.] [32] “ [There seem to have been nine children, although perhaps until this trial, or until after the trial began, the attorneys on either side supposed there were but eight. These were Llewellyn, the oldest of the sons, Andrew, John, Philip and James; (James is said to be the youngest of the family,) and there were four sisters; according to the account, one of them mar ried a Hindman and died within a month, one of the witnesses says, and this is corroborated in a statement in one of the papers about John having a ninth interest in the land. That interest being personal property (and clearly there being no election at that time, at least) seems to me to show there had been no election of all of them to take as land, which occurred, as I understand the claim, when James had arrived at the age of twenty-one. “Now, there is no direct evidence of the declaration-of that woman or her husband that either of them had made the transfer ; the only proof of it is the general declarations, derived from so many sources, from different parties, that the others had sold out, and I think at this great length of time it might fairly be presumed that she or her husband had sold out; it being personal property as the land then stood it went to her husband, it became his when he married her, if he saw fit to reduce it to possession.] [33] Another of them married an Armstrong, and she died leaving three children, and another sister married.the same Armstrong and then the remaining sister married John Hindman. “ [The plaintiffs allege that Llewellyn, John and Philip remaining at home, bought the interest of their sisters and the other brothers, James and Andrew, that is, all their interest in the land. Now, as I have said to you, it was not necessary that this should be in writing. They allege in addition, that after that was done, the mother still being living, they all consented by arrangement among them, and a partition of this land was made among themselves and to some extent partition fences made, and that Philip and John took their share together and treated it separately as their own, from that time until Llewellyn’s death, and Llewellyn took his share of the land separately. Now, if they did that, if they were in possession, if they had bought out the others, whether by writing or verbally, and paid, or bargained for it, they being the sole parties interested in the land, at least in the remainder, with the consent of their mother, and I think even without her consent, could make a partition, and if they formally and absolutely divided it, then from that time it ceased to be personal property and became land as to them; to make.that parol partition good they must have actually made it, agreed on the division line, and occupied it as such and recognized the respective titles in severalty in each other. If that were once done then the title would become good in each of them severally, and it would not be divested by any attempt of some of these parties afterwards, who had sold out their interest as personalty, to claim that because there was land and the transfer was not in writing it was not good, and to repudiate it. If any one sold his interest to these parties, or any of them, he could not afterwards convey a title, because he had none to convey. And if the three being owners of all the interests made a division among themselves and entered into possession and occupied it as such, one or two of them could not afterwards repudiate and claim that he owned the whole of it.] [34] “ Now, it is a question of fact for you as to whether or not that was done. The burden of proof to show that it was done is on the plaintiffs. They claim they have done it, by abundant testimony or declarations of the different parties. Several witnesses have testified as to the building of the house; I think there is no question that the brick house on the land in dispute was built in 1837, was marked and remains marked yet, according to the witnesses, with the initials of Llewellyn Howell; and that in 1839 a brick house was built on what was known as John Howell’s end, and that was marked with the initials of John Howell, and John Howell continued to occupy that house from that time, as long as he lived. Different witnesses tell you that John Howell pointed out to them the line, told them a certain fence leading from the Patterson line towards the McCormick line, which ran a considerable distance, was the partition line. Another witness, perhaps two of them, says that in selling timber they cut to the line, and that each, John and Llewellyn, showed them the line and told them not to cut over it, and the declarations of John, Philip and Llewellyn that they had bought out the other interests, that they had made these divisions among themselves and that Llewellyn, in 1842, probably, possibly in 1844, built what was then a fine barn upon his share, and that he built a good spring house. “The mother lived there. John married; some of the witnesses say that was before the house on his end was built, some say afterwards, and some say that they don’t know, but it was about that time. There is not much doubt it was built in view of a marriage, and it is not very important. “ It is alleged that Philip went there; his declarations are proven that he and John had taken their end, and that he quarreled with John’s wife, or rather when drunk had abused her and he had to leave, and he went back to Llewellyn’s house. Philip does not seem to have been much of a farmer; there is evidence that he cultivated sometimes on one side and sometimes on another, and that he ran the sawmill and had considerable business as a thresher around the country. On the other hand, [it is also shown by some of these witnesses, there are acts of Llewellyn acting as owner in the presence of the mother. That the mother lived in the new brick house built on this portion in question, is not in dispute, and that she died there, and that she had some arrangement by which she had her living is pretty certain. There is no evidence or indication that she was in any way discontented with it, and the will of Llewellyn Howell asserts that she had her dower in this portion that he claims to devise.] [35] On the other hand, they allege that this was a mere family arrangement, temporary, and not an actual partition, and that Llewellyn and Philip, especially, occupied in common. Mr. Swanger is the principal witness to that, in fact the only one. He says that all the parties were at home together at the time that the first house was built. I understood him all the boys — another part of his testimony would indicate that he merely meant John, Philip and Llewellyn, and certainly the weight of testimony is heavily that Andrew and James were away from there before that time, considerably. According to the testimony, James came of age about 1834 or 1835; he learned the cooper trade with his brother-in-law, Hindman. “ [There is evidence also offered showing that in 1835 there was a written conveyance and a formal assignment by the sister who was then the wife of Armstrong, and her husband, joining in the conveyance or assignment of their interest in this land (the whole land left by their father) to Llewellyn, John and Philip, and also by Mr. Armstrong, as surviving husband of his deceased wife, another sister, conveying his interest in it, or the interest of the wife, and while it provides for the children conveying thereafter when they are of age, nevertheless it was entirely good, unless there had been an agreement of all the parties before that time to elect to take it as land, and I do not see how there could be. The conveyance is good ; it is not to John, it is not to Philip, it is not to Llewellyn, but to John, Llewellyn and Philip.] [36] “Again; the old lady died in 1853. Then, for the first time, any one who had not disposed of his or her interest could com pel the executors to proceed aud sell under the will of Llewellyn Howell, Sr. It seems that the executors were dead, and John Howell had taken out letters of administration annexed to the will, and would have the powers of the executors. [Andrew Howell apparently repudiated his former sale to some of them, came into the orphans’ court and filed a petition to have John Howell compelled to sell that land under the will of the father, and distribute the proceeds, to which there was an answer made by John Howell, under oath, in which he asserts that Andrew had sold his interest long before to Llewellyn, Philip and himself, and Andrew’s petition was dismissed. It was probably filed on the assumption that only a written agreement would be valid, and John’s answer is a very formal assertion as to Andrew’s interest, that Philip and Llewellyn and he had bought it jointly, and corresponds with Andrew’s statement of it before as testified to by witnesses.] [37] “Now, when we come to the other portion of it, other questions arise. First, find this question, — and it is the great aud important question in the case, — as to whether or not the plaintiffs are entitled to take here the entirety, or whether simply the interest of Llewellyn Howell, under the will of his father, which they have all said would be the eighth, if there was no partition. “ The first question logically, I think, for jrou to determine is: Did Llewellyn, John and Philip bargain and buy out their two brothers and their sisters, whether in writing or verbally, and then, having bought the interests by consent of their mother, make a partition of the ground that was distinct and visible, and make their improvements and occupy the property in that way, in severalty ? The burden is on the plaintiffs to satisfy you by the weight of evidence that they did. If the3r did, then this portion that was allotted in that way and occupied by Llewellyn was his at his death, and he had a right to devise it. If it was not, he had not the right to devise anything but his undivided interest in it. If you find that they did, then we have other questions which are largely questions of law or equity. If the three brothers did so own it, having bought the others out and made partition on the ground among themselves and occupied it in that way, it established the title of Llewellyn, and John.Hovvell could not controvert it. “ Now, as to the defendants in this case who are purchasers from John Howell, some other questions arise, and they are serious questions, but largely questions of law for the court. A purchaser without notice, or without circumstances and facts to put him on the proper inquiry, may take a good title where his vendor had a very poor title. [In this case it was claimed for the defendants that they are entitled to be protected as innocent purchasers, because they had bought from John, who had quitclaims from the brothers and sisters, not from Llewellyn, and that they were not bound to inquire any further. We think differently. Llewellyn Howell’s title was right in the line of their investigation. Until Llewellyn Howell’s agreement to take as land and take whatever interest he had in this land as a whole was established, they could not take as land; they would only take equitable interests, assignment of the interests of others, and were bound to inquire as to-Llewellyn’s consent, and how it came. Now, the only thing they had as to Llewellyn’s consent was their knowledge of occupancy, or his will. His will they admit they saw, and they were bound to look for it. That will, in most unequivocal terms, presented to them an assertion on the part of Llewellyn Howell that he owned and had a right to devise the whole of his farm; not an undivided interest, but that he owned the farm on which he resided and the buildings thereon; and the portion which he wills to Andrew Howell for life, and then to those plaintiffs, was described as having the buildings thereon. We think that put them on inquiry as to where Llewellyn Howell lived at the time of his death, and what buildings he occupied and what farm he claimed to have. I say it is the only record evidence they have of Llewellyn’s resolve to take as land, and that put them on inquiry as to the fact of his having elected to take his undivided interest and of having an actual fee in the whole of the tract on which he resided; and having that interest, they were then bound to make the necessary inquiries, and if there was evidence that he had lived on that tract, and on inquiry from the proper parties, which would not be merely John Howell or the parties that he was buying from, the3r could have found out the portion that Llewellyn had occupied in severalty; then if they did not make the inquiry they took at the risk of it being established that Llewellyn had the right he claimed under the will. “Again, they claim under, and it was in the line of their title, and they set up certain ejectments. This family of the Howells does not appear to be a very harmonious one among themselves after Llewellyn’s death, and first Andrew filed his petition in .the orphans’ court to compel John to sell and divide the proceeds under the will of the father; defeated in that, he and James bring an ejectment covering the whole tract of three hundred acres of which the father had died seized, and they were nonsuited in that; and, by the way, John tells them in answer to the petition that the only claim that Andrew has is under the will of Llewellyn. They brought another ejectment about as soon as they were nonsuited, claiming in the whole land, and were nonsuited — did not endeavor to go to trial. It was an assertion against their- former assertion that they had sold it. Then in 1856, for the first time they bring an ejectment in reasonably proper shape, and they bring that ejectment as devisees of Llewellyn Howell. “ This land as then claimed was ‘ the land owned and occupied by Llewellyn Howell, Jr., at the time of his death.’ They so described it and the case goes to trial and it is settled in the end. “On the 17th of December, 1857, an agreement is come to (which simply binds themselves, but which I think is evidence in the ease) by which James gets for-himself fifty acres of land on the north side out of the portion that Llewellyn had devised to him and to his children, and he is to pay John, among others, the legacy that Llewellyn charged on the land, and the verdict is allowed to go against Andrew; and what would be the reasonable presumption is shown by the evidence to be true, Andrew was to get money. “ Judge Mellon tells us that when he came to buy, or in settling up the case, and wanting a quitclaim from Andrew, he himself paid the money, if not into Andrew’s hands, in his presence, to make up the thousand dollars named in his quitclaim, and they had a memorandum of this agreement made at the time, or about the time of this - ejectment, by which Andrew was to get one thousand dollars; and Andrew conveys his interest to John a day or two after the deed to Judge Mellon. Of course it inured to the benefit of Judge Mellon, and Andrew’s interest in Llewellyn’s land went to Judge Mel- Ion. Now, under that they had a right to possession; they had his title and under Llewellyn’s will Andrew had a right to possession, and that ejectment is in my judgment notice of what was claimed in Llewellyn’s will to be his farm. For this, and several other reasons I might mention, — but I think these are conclusive, — the purchasers from John Howell are not innocent purchasers for value without notice of this outstanding title. They took the risk of Llewellyn’s devisees making good his assertion that he owned in fee and had a right to devise absolutely this farm on which he lived; and they ran the risk of the proof thereafter, and especially there is no protection to them in regal'd to the general interest that Llewellyn would have in the farm of his one eighth interest.] [38] “ There is another question that is a question of fact for you as to whether Llewellyn Howell, the third, the oldest of these parties, is entitled to recover against Judge Mellon. It is alleged that he is estopped by his acts. A man may be estopped by his talk from setting up absolute rights that he has. If I own a horse, having an absolute title to it, that is in the possession of Judge Reed, and he undertakes to sell it to the foreman of the jury, and I stand by and encourage him to sell, do not intimate that it is my horse, but on the contrary encourage him to sell it, I cannot turn around and say, ‘ That is my horse; ’ and if I prove it and it is admitted, the foreman will take the horse from me, and properly, because it would not be honest for me to stand by and allow the sale. “ [Now, Judge Mellon says that at the time he bargained, and between the bargain and the payment of the purchase money, young Howell, then of age, was present at different times, entered into discussions, and that he spoke of the James and Andrew trouble and their fight, and ‘pooh poohed’ it; said it was not any claim, that his father had bought out all the heirs. His after conduct, being in the employ of Judge Mellon, I do not think would amount to estoppel, but the question is this: Did Judge Mellon rely on these representations of Llewellyn Howell, Third, even in part, not as a whole ? Of course he would not rely on it altogether; 'but did that in part induce him to make that purchase and ignore these matters of record that ought to have put him on inquiry; if it did, then Llewellyn Howell, Third, cannot recover; he is estopped. It is a question of fact for you. We have been asked to say it was an estoppel; and also that it is not an estoppel; the jury must determine that; it is a question of fact whether or not these representations were made by j'oung Howell, and whether they were part of the inducement to Judge Mellon to pay his money.] [89] “ There will be four forms of verdict which you can render. If jmu fail to find that there was this acquiring of interest by Llewellyn, John and Philip and the partition by them, then the plaintiffs would only be entitled to the one eighth of this land, Llewellyn being entitled to one eighth. “ If there was no acquiring of interest and no partition, and if you should find that Llewellyn, Third, is estopped from claiming, then you would find for the defendants as to Llewellyn Howell, and for the other plaintiffs for the six sevenths of the one eighth. “ Then, if you find that there was that acquiring of interest find the partition alleged by plaintiffs, you will find for the land described in the writ, that is the whole of it, unless you find that Llewellyn is estopped ; and if you find that Llewellyn is estopped, then you find again for the defendants as to Llewellyn Howell, and for the other plaintiffs for the six sevenths of the whole. “ Judge Mellon suggests that I repeat about the question as to whether or not Llewellyn had encouraged him to purchase; I mean, to consummate the purchase by means of paying purchase money. “ Bear in mind that there are three Llewellyn Howells: Llewellyn, the old man, who owned this ground away back in 1828; Llewellyn, Jr., his oldest son, who died in 1851, and then Llewellyn Howell, the oldest of these brothers and sisters, who is the son of John. “ I will mark these papers, gentlemen. The first verdict, which I have marked No. 1, is the one on the theory of the plaintiffs that there was this purchase, partition and occupancy on the part of Llewellyn Howell, and that the third Llewellyn Howell is not estopped; the one marked No. 2 will be on the same theory, only that Llewellyn Howell is estopped by his statement to Judge Mellon before the purchase was consummated. I have marked No. 3 the verdict on the theory of the defendants that there was no partition between John Howell and Llewellyn Howell, and that Llewellyn’s acts are not sufficient to estop him ; and No. 4 will be on the same theory, assuming that you will find that Llewellyn’s acts estop him from claiming. “I will repeat: One and three are in favor of Llewellyn Howell, the present plaintiff, just as for the others; two and four are against Llewellyn Howell, the present plaintiff.” Plaintiffs presented the following point: “If the jury believe from the evidence that, in the lifetime .of Llewellyn Howell, Jr., and after all the children of Llewellen Howell, Sr., had become of age, Llewellyn Howell, Jr., John and Philip bought out all the interests of their brothers and sisters in the proceeds of the land devised by their father, Llewellyn Howell, Sr., deceased, by his will dated July 24, 1828, whether by contract made verbally or in writing;' “ That, subsequently, with the assent of their mother, Llewellyn Howell, Jr., John and Philip elected to treat the land thereafter as land, and by division line run on the ground, also with the assent of their mother, made a parol partition of the land between them, one purpart, embracing the coal land now in dispute, being allotted to Llewellyn Howell, Jr., and the other purpart being allotted to John and Philip Howell; “ That, in pursuance to said partition, Llewellyn Howell, Jr., of the one part, and John and Philip of the other, entered into possession of their respective purparts, and thereafter each made valuable improvements and exercised other acts of exclusive ownership over his or their purpart, until the death of Llewellyn Howell, Jr., in 1851; “ That by the will of Llewellyn Howell, Jr., dated January 22, 1851, and duly admitted to probate, in evidence, the land in dispute, to wit: sixty-four and one half acres, more or less, being the one half of the land allotted to and taken by Llewellyn Howell, Jr., under said parol partition, was devised to Andrew Howell forlife, and on his death without issue to John Howell’s children; and further, “That after the death of said Llewellyn Howell, Jr., his devisee, Andrew Howell, died without issue, and that thereafter John Howell died leaving the plaintiffs in this case as his children, “Then (if the jury find the foregoing facts), no sufficient defense has been shown against a recovery by the plaintiffs in this case, and the verdict of the jury should be in favor of the plaintiffs.” By the Court: “ Affirmed.” [28] Defendants’ points were as follows: “ 3. Also, as to the alleged partition or division line between John and Llewellyn, that the evidence is insufficient in this, viz: that it was not shown when and how and where located with sufficient certainty, and by whose authority, or that it was hot merely to designate' that part which the widow perf mitted John to occupy, from the part which she retained to herself and Llewellyn and.Philip, who continued with her; nor is it shown that, before it was made, all the heirs had consented to look to the land as such, and waive a sale, and besides, there was no continuous fence or other prominent landmarks on the ground to attract attention to the alleged line when Mellon purchased in 1863, and had no notice or intimation of such a line till a year or more afterwards. Answer: The 3d point is refused. If the evidence of the plaintiffs is believed, it is sufficient to establish a purchase by Llewellyn, John and Philip, of the interests of their other brothers and sisters in the whole farm and its proceeds, and that they being owners thereof with consent and agreement of their mother, made a parol partition of the land among themselves, by which the share of Llewellyn Howell, Jr., was set apart by definite metes and bounds and occupied by him as such to the time of his death. It is a question of fact for the jury.” [24] “6. The uncontroverted evidence shows that all had consented to waive a sale and take or look to the land for their shares, and that all jurisdiction of the Orphans’ Court over the subject-matter had ceased long before Mellon purchased. Answer: The 6th point is refused. It is a question of fact for the jury. The court would find the facts to be as alleged in the point. [25] “7. That the character of land.being thus restored, Mellon was entitled to rely on the record title, and was not affected by any secret sales or trust by or between the legatees, and not recorded when he bought. Answer: Refused, except as it is answered in the general charge.” [26] “11. Fraud is not alleged or presumable, without more or better evidence to raise a presumption of conspiracy between John and his five brothers and sisters to defraud his children out of a contingent remainder of the land in dispute; or to enable him to defraud purchasers, and still preserve the contingent remainder to his children. The five deeds to him are therefore unimpeaclied, and his honesty remaius intact; and it must be inferred that Llewellyn’s interest beyond his one eighth was insignificant or forfeited, by reason of nonpayment or compliance with the conditions of the parol executory agreement under which he claimed; or was canceled by some settlement or arrangement of him and John, between the date of Llewellyn’s will and time of his death. Answer: Refused. [27] “ 12. Then (if defendants’ 11th point as to fraud is refused) on the hypothesis of the compromise verdict in the last of the three ejectment cases of Andrew and James against John in 1857, viz: that the mother had permitted Llewellyn and John, under an understanding between them, and between them and some or all of the brothers and sisters, to divide the place, subject to the rights of such of the others as had not given their consent, and with the purpose or intent of paying for and acquiring the shares or interests of the others, as they could afterwards; then, to instruct the jury to bring in a conditional verdict for so much as John had advanced beyond his proportion, in paying off the others in Llewellyn’s lifetime, together with what he advanced and the expenses he incurred after Llewellyn’s death, in paying for and acquiring title to shares after Llewellyn’s death, with interest thereon from the dates of such payments and expenditures. Answer: The 12th point is refused. There is not sufficient evidence of any such preponderance of payment as would justify the jury in finding an amount. [28] “13. That the will of Llewellyn Howell, Jr., was not constructive notice to the Youghiogheny River Coal Company or to W. L. Scott of adverse title, and that no. actual notice to them has been shown by the evidence. Answer: Refused. [29] “ 14. That the ejectment proceedings of Andrew and James Howell v. John Howell et al., at No. 531, November term, 1856, was to the Youghiogheny River Coal Company and W. L. Scott constructive notice only as to the title of the fifty acres therein awarded Jo James Howell, and not of the title to the land claimed in this suit, and that no actual notice of said suit to them has been shown by the evidence. Answer: Refused. [30] “ 15. That the defendants, W. L. Scott and the Yougbiogheny River Coal Company are, under the evidence in this case, bona fide purchasers for value of title of Thomas Mellon to the land in suit, without notice, actual or constructive, of the adverse title set up by plaintiffs, and are, therefore, protected therefrom. Answer: Refused.” [31] Errors assigned were (1 — 22) rulings on evidence; (23-39) instructions as above, quoting them. William B. Rodgers and J. MeF. Carpenter, P. C. Knox and James II. Reed with them, for appellants. A. Under elementary rules the testimony of the declarations relied on was inadmissible, but if any of it was admissible, such part or parts were insufficient and incompetent to establish appellees’ parol purchase of shares, or the parol consent necessary to reconvert the land to realty, or the parol partition alleged; and failing as to any one of these three propositions, the appellees’ case fails. B. The evidence in the case discloses several distinct facts, which rendered the reconversion of the land to realty or parol partition impossible in Llewellyn, Jr.’s lifetime, viz: 1. The widow’s outstanding life estate expressly giving her exclusive possession. 2. Mary’s share outstanding in her husband. 3. Sarah’s share outstanding in her minor children, and their incompetency during minority to give consent to accept the land. 4. Andrew and James’ shares also outstanding, as appears in the proceedings and the result of the three ejectment cuses. C. Reconversion of the land to realty after Llewellyn, Jr.’s death, viz: 1. By the death of Mary’s husband shortly after or perhaps before the death of the widow, her share devolved on the remaindermen or their assigns, and thereby the number was reduced from nine to eight. 2. James’s share was set apart to him in land in 1857 by compromising the third ejectment. 3. Llewllyn, Jr., by his will unequivocally elects to take in land, which would apply to any interest he had, more or less. 4. John acquired five shares by deed, which with his own made six, thus completing the consent of the remaining eight after the death of Mary’s husband. This all appeared on the judicial and county records, and thereby the land was restored to xealt3r in 1857, six years after Llewellyn, Jr.’s death, and six years before Mellon, the first named appellant, made his purchase. D. By restoration of the land to the status of realt3' its legal title was restored according to the interest and ownership therein at the time of its restoration, as manifested on the judicial and county records, and Mellon, the purchaser from John, took a legal title, as also did the other two defendants successively as they purchased afterwards, and from the time of the reconversion to land, James having had his share set apart to him, the appellees and Llewllyn, Jr.’s devisees became tenants in common in the residue, one undivided eighth part in the devisees (appellees) and seven undivided eighth parts in the appellants. E. When Mellon purchased there was nothing whatever on the premises to indicate a previous ownership or occupancy by Llewellyn, Jr.; and nothing on the public records to indicate any other interest or ownership in the land by him other than his individual share under his father’s will, and Mellon, the first purchaser from John, made diligent inquiry of all who were yet living and had been connected with the title in any way, and the attorneys on both sides in the protracted litigation occurring after Llewellyn, Jr.’s death, and was uniformly informed that Llewellyn, Jr.’s will could relate only to his individual share under the father’s will, as he never had acquired any other. F. If there was anything overlooked by Mellon or the other purchasers in making inquiry as to the title of outside parties, such as those testifying to declarations on the trial, the3r were unknown to Mellon at the time, and if negligence can be attributed to Mellon or the other purchasers under him, the appellees are precluded by the equitable defense arising from the gross laches and contributory negligence of Llewellyn, Jr., in disregarding all the ordinary and usual methods of acquiring and evidencing ownership of choses in action of the kind in question, and the negligence of the appellees since his death in with holding all notice from the purchasers that they claimed a larger share in the land by a separate and different title, — purchase by parol in their devisor, — than that which the records of the county show to have been vested in him. G-. The foregoing positions of defense are separate and independent of each other, and if any one of them prevails the appellees’ case is defeated except as to the part conceded, viz: the one undivided eighth under the father’s will. As to such of the errors assigned as would result only in a retrial of the case, they are too numerous to mention in detail, but are presented under their appropriate specifications. The acts and declarations relied on must have such clearness and directness as will leave no doubt as to their meaning and purpose: Allison v. Burns, 107 Pa. 50. The declarations of a vendor after he has parted with the title are not admissible to impeach the title of the vendee: McLaughlin v. McLaughlin, 91 Pa. 462; Smith, v. Gibson, 1 Yeates, 291; Com. v. Knapp, 9 Pick. 507; Jackson v. Payne, 114 Pa. 67; McIldowny v. Williams, 28 Pa. 493; Silliman v. Haas, 151 Pa. 52; McGinity v. McGinity, 63 Pa. 38. The loose declarations of one who claims land, in relation to his title, are not to be relied on and used as evidence to defeat a title otherwise good: Sandford v. Decamp, 8 Watts, 542; Miller v. Holman, 1 Grant, 244; Salem Bank v. Gloucester Bank, 17 Mass. 27. When an attempt is made to establish title to land under a parol contract, proof thereof in all its essentials and in all its equities should be so plain and clear as to preclude doubt or hesitation as to the contract and the equities arising therefrom: Miller v. Zufall, 113 Pa. 317; see also Sower v. Weaver, 78 Pa. 443; Shellhammer v. Ashbaugh, 83 Pa. 24; Edwards v. Morgan, 100 Pa. 330; Moyer’s App., 105 Pa. 432; Burgess v. Burgess, 109 Pa. 312. Every presumption is against the claimant under such a sale: Ackerman v. Fisher, 57 Pa. 457. Facts dependent on the candor, intelligence and memory of the witnesses are for the jury. Where the truth is determined by inferences or probabilities from established or undisputed facts, it is for the court: Kittel’s Est., 156 Pa. 445; Del. & C. R. R. Co. v. Cadow, 120 Pa. 559; Cougle v. McKee, 151 Pa.. 602; Brown v. Barnes, 151 Pa. 562. When in an ejectment the plaintiff rests his title upon an alleged parol contract of sale of the property in dispute, he is seeking in effect a decree of specific execution, and the burden is upon him to show a contract complete in its terms, and such partial performance, including a taking of possession in pursuance of the contract, as would make it unjust and inequitable not to execute it: Reno v. Moss, 120 Pa. 49; Miller v. Specht, 11 Pa. 449. A bona fide purchaser without notice is not affected by notice to his vendor: Bond v. Stroup, 3 Binn. 66; McElroy v. Braden, 152 Pa. 81; Hottenstein v. Lerch, 104 Pa, 454; Bryan’s App., 101 Pa. 394. Neither vague reports of strangers, nor information given by a person not interested, respecting a defect of title, will affect a purchaser without a, notice: Kerns v. Swope, 2 Watts, 75; Duff v. Patterson, 159 Pa. 312. Where the evidence in an ejectment suit tends to show that A was present when B purchased property from C and assisted the parties and subsequently permitted B to expend money in improving the same, under the impression that he had secured a good title, the court should charge that if the jury believe A knew these facts, then both he and those claiming under him were estopped from setting up an outstanding title against B : Wahl v. Pittsburg & Western R. R. Co., 158 Pa. 257. The resume should be as full on one side as on the other: Gehman v. Erdman, 105 Pa. 371; Reber v. Herring, 115 Pa. 599; Leibig v. Steiner, 94 Pa. 466. Though the law be stated correctly, yet if the court so comments upon the law as to practically take away the effect of the statement, and influence them into disregarding it, it is error: McFadden v. Reynolds, 20 W. N. C. 312; Quinby v. R. W. Co., 2 Del. 285. Boyd Crumrine, J. P. Patterson and I). P. Patterson with him, for appellees.' The purchaser of an imperfect title (or rather of no title or interest at all, either legal or equitable, to the land in this case), is bound to know what title or interest he is buying; and if it be not a title perfect on its face, that ultimately he will get nothing by his purchase; in short that he buys at his peril. Caveat emptor is the rule : Chew v. Barnett, 11 S. & R. 392; Knapp v. Bailey, 79 Me. 195, cited in 16 Am. & Eng. Ency. of Law, 790; Pringle v. Pringle, 5 Sandf. (N.Y.) 157. Possession of land for a long period, after a purchase of it at a sale for taxes, affords a presumption that the formal provisions of the act of assembly regulating such sales were complied with: Coxe v. Derringer, 78 Pa. 289; Jones v. Bland, 112 Pa. 176; Carter v. Tinicum Fishing Co., 77 Pa. 315; Foulk v. Brown, 2 Watts, 214; Richards v. Elwell, 48 Pa. 361; Brock v. Savage, 31 Pa. 410. Evidence sufficient to establish a parol sale of land is not required to prove a parol partition ; it is not for the court but for the jury, as in other cases : McKnight v. Bell, 135 Pa. 370. Observe, that in the will of Llewellyn Howell, Jr., there are definite and specific dispositions of the farm “ whereon Inoto reside ” as his own land; and this is an assertion of title in him to the land as land while in possession thereof. The will was not a general devise of “ all his real estate,” which might be operative upon any kind of interest in real estate he might own at his death. But, whatever it was, John Howell, having recognized the will as a valid will and pleaded it in solemn judicial proceedings, is estopped with his privies from claiming against it: Miller v. Springer, 70 Pa. 269; Duffey v. Pres. Cong., 48 Pa. 46; Spaulding v. Eimers, 3 Pittsb. 306; Putnam v. Tyler, 117 Pa. 570; Root v. Crock, 7 Pa 378. The evidence was sufficient to establish the purchase of the outstanding interests, as against the defendant in this case, and also as to the effect of the estoppel as to John and those now claiming under him: Mellon v. Reed, 114 Pa. 647; Same v. Same, 123 Pa. 1. “ In a partition of lands between tenants in common, who derive their estate by descent, there is an implied warranty of title. Hence, in an action of ejectment by one of them, for a part of the land allotted to him, another of those who were tenants in common with him is not a competent witness for the plaintiff: ” Weiser v. Weiser, 5 Watts, 280; Paterson v. Lanning, 10 Watts, 136; Seaton v. Barry, 4 W. & S. 183; Feather v. Strohecker, 3 P. & W. 506; Sawyers v. Cator, 8 Humph. 256 (47 Am. Dec. 608); Morris v. Harris, 9 Gill (Md.), 19. Not only is there no evidence on the part of W. L. Scott or the Youghiogheny River Coal Co. that they were without no tice of the plaintiffs’ title, but none that to constitute them bona-fide purchasers they had paid the purchase money; they were required to prove the actual payment of the purchase money by other evidence than the recital of their deeds.

       "  'case_summary': \"CHARLESTON. Clara L. Gilbert v. Adelle Pope McCreary. Submitted September 21, 1920. Decided September 28, 1920. 1. Quieting Title — Assertion of Invalid Title Held a Cloud on the Title. Assertion of an invalid claim to the title to real estate, based upon a mere semblance thereof, in the form of a muniment of title, constitutes a cloud on the good and valid title under which the property is actually held, and the owner in possession of the property under the valid title may maintain a suit in equity to remove or dissipate the cloud, by such a decree as may be necessary to effect such result, (p. 59). 2. Same — Adjudication of Good Title in Plaintiff Precludes Right Claimed by Defendant. Cancellation of the instrument under which the unfounded claim is set up is ordinarily the means by which cloud is removed from title, but is not exclusive; and the result may be effected by mere adjudication of good title in the plaintiff in such suit, which forever precludes the right so claimed by the defendant, (p. 60). 3. Same — Invalidity of Instrument Toy which Title is Claimed is No Bar to Suit. Invalidity of the instrument or provision under which the claim is set up, on its face, constitutes no bar to a suit to remove cloud from title, if the true owner is in possession of the property affected by the cloud, (p. 61). - 4. Same — Statutory Remedy Does Not Preclude Equitable Remedy. Nor does a remedy given by statute, for relief under such circumstances, - preclude right to- invoke the remedy in equity. (p. 60). 6. Same — Claim Based on Will Insufficiently Describing Land is a Cloud on Title. A claim of title set up under the invalid one of two inconsistent and contradictory descriptions of a .piece of real estate, found in a will by which a piece,- parcel or lot of land is divided between two devisees, constitutes a cloud upon the title of the portion of the land against which it is asserted, (p. 59). 6. Deeds — Wills—Where Particular Description Does Not Harmonize wfith Intention of Testator or Grantor, the General Description Will Prevail. Ordinarily, a particular description of land found in a deed or will prevails over a general description thereof found in the same instrument; hut, if the general description harmonizes with the manifest intention of the parties, in the case of a deed, or of the testator, in the case of a will, as disclosed by any proper evidence, including the terms of the instrument, and the particular description does not, the ordinary rule of preference does not apply ana the general description prevails, (p. 61). '7. Boundaries — Wills—General Description by Street and Number Held to Prevail Over Metes and Bounds. If a will devising an unnumbered part of a city lot, on which there is a house bearing a certain number, describes it by the number of the house and name of the street on which it fronts, calling the property a “house and lot,” and then describes the lot by metes and hounds so as not to include all of the ground covered by the house, the general description conforming to the manifest intent of the testator, to give the house for comfortable use and enjoyment, prevails over the particular description, (p. 62). ■3. Wills — Parts of Particular Description and General Descrip-, tion May be Used. In such case, parts of the particular description found to be in harmony with the testator’s intention and the general description may be used in defining the limits of the subject of the devise., (p. 65). •.9. Same — Devise of “Dwelling House” Passes Title to Latid in Connection Therewith. A devise of a dwelling house, by a description sufficiently definite and certain to afford means of identification thereof, passes title to all of the ground covered by the house and such additional and adjacent land of the testator as was used in connection with the house, at the date of execution of the will, and is necessary for reasonable use and enjoyment thereof, in the absence of a clear and unambiguous expression of intention to the contrary, (p. 63). 10. Judgment — Decree in Suit to Quiet Title Held Not to Preclude ■ Suit to Establish Title. A decree adverse to the plaintiff in a suit in which title to property is claimed by inheritance-and under an alleged trust does not preclude, by adjudication, right in the same person to maintain a second suit against the same defendant, for vindication of right and title to a par.t of the same property, vested in the former by a devise, (p. 63). II. Wills — Suit to Quiet Title Held, Not an Election, Preventing' Suit to Establish, Title Under Devise. Nor does the prosecution of such suit preclude right to-maintain the second, on the theory of an election on the part of the plaintiff, not to take title under the will; the election if any, being deemed, in the absence of proof to the-contrary, to have been made under a mistake as to the nature of the plaintiff’s rights in the premises, (p. 63).

Specific performance — evidence insufficient to establish marketable title by adverse possession. A person should not be compelled to take title to property where he must defend the title by parol evidence. In an action for specific performance where the vendor’s title depends upon adverse possession more convincing proof of adverse possession must be produced to establish the marketability of the «title than would be necessary to defend the title if directly attacked by some adverse claimant. Where in an action for specific performance plaintiff bases her title upon adverse possession and the evidence shows that she cannot depend on the inclosure of her property or the cultivation or - possession thereof for a period of twenty years, and where there is some question as to an easement and as to a description, defendant should have judgment dismissing the complaint dn the merits and the recovery on his counterclaim for his down payment, with interest and taxable costs.

Where defendant used a lot as a yard in connection with his blacksmith shop and permitted teamsters, peddlers, and others, who had occasion to do so, to use it as a camp ground when this did not interfere with his own use and occupation of it, the occasional driving over it by plaintiff in going to and from its barn was not an interference with or interruption of his possession. (Page 473.) 6. Lost Instruments — Establishmient — Evidence. Defendant, claiming by adverse possession under color of title, sufficiently proves the contents of a deed given him thirty years before, and since destroyed, by testimony that at such time, for a certain consideration recited and paid, the then record owner executed to him a quitclaim deed of the land, which was witnessed and acknowledged, though he cannot recite its eontents.

Defendant appeals. REVERSED with DIRECTIONS. STATEMENT OE FACTS. Plaintiff, a corporation organized and existing under tbe laws of tbe state of\\'Utah, brought this action against tbe defendant to quiet title to a certain parcel of ground described in its complaint as “situate in tbe town of Bingbam Canyon, Salt Lake County, state of Utah, to-wit: All of lot 80 in said town of Bingbam Canyon, as tbe same is described on Smith’s survey of Main Bingbam townsite.” Plaintiff claimed to deraign title to the land in controversy through mesne conveyances from a United States patent called tbe “Valentine Patent,” issued July 10, 1876, to David H. Bentley. Defendant claims tbe land by adverse possession in himself and bis predecessors since tbe date of tbe issuance of tbe Valentine patent referred to, under claim of title founded upon a written instrument. Tbe land in controversy is situated at tbe junction of Bingbam Canyon road and Carr’s Fork road, tbe main thoroughfares along which tbe town of Bingbam Canyon is built. Tbe following diagram shows tbe boundaries in dispute and their location, with reference to tbe other properties in that vicinity, and will, to some extent, aid in illustrating tbe questions involved. Tbe area of tbe ground in. dispute is 25x100 feet, and is designated in tbe record, and marked on tbe above diagram, as lot 80. Defendant, in bis counterclaim, alleged ownership to another piece of ground 30x65 feet in lot 81, contiguous to and north of lot 80. Defendant’s blacksmith shop, with tbe exception of tbe southwest comer thereof, which is on lot 80, is on this 30x65 feet of ground. Plaintiff disclaimed ownership and all right of possession to the 30x65 feet of land mentioned, and that part of lot 80 upon which the southwest comer of defendant’s blacksmith shop1 stands. The facts upon which the respective parties rely for a recovery in this action are about as follows: Long prior to 1876 the ground represented by the diagram was used as a sawmill site and logging ground by one James Campbell under a deed from A. D. Heaton, made December 28, 18.69. The sawmill stood north of the land in controversy and on what is designated in the record as lot 82. The premises lying north of lot 80 Campbell sold to parties who later on converted the buildings used in connection with the sawmill into a, livery stable. In November, 1876, defendant purchased from the parties who were then in possession of the livery stable premises under a conveyance from Campbell, a piece of ground 30x50 feet in lot 81, contiguous to and north of the premises in dispute. The land lying south of this 30x50 feet and embracing lot 80 remained in the possession of Campbell, under his deed from Heaton. In 1876 defendant, after purchasing the 30x50 feet of ground mentioned, erected a blacksmith shop thereon. About the time he commenced the erection of his blacksmith shop he obtained permission from Campbell’s agent and attorney in fact to occupy the 25x100 feet of ground embraced within lot 80 and to use the same as a yard for his blacksmith shop\\'. In pursuance of the permission thus given him, defendant, in November,. 1876, entered into possession of and occupied lot 80 as Campbell’s tenant or licensee and used the ground embraced therein for the storing of his fuel, for the repairing of vehicles and implements, and for the storing of the same, for outhouses, and for all other purposes for which yards of this character are generally used. Defendant continued to thus occupy the premises until 1879, when, according to Ms testimony, wMch stands uncontradicted, he purchased the land embraced within lot 80 and received a quitclaim deed thereto from Campbell. This deed, which he failed to have recorded, was lost in a fire wMch occurred in 1895, and which burned down his blacksmith shop and destroyed all of his books and papers. On July 10, 1876, a United States patent was issued to David H. Bentley, for forty acres of land. This patent, referred to in the record as the “Valentine Patent/\"’ covers a large portion of the ground upon wMch the town of Bingham Canyon is built, including the premises in dispute. Soon after the patent was issued preparations were made by the occupying claimants in Bingham Canyon, including defendant, to test its validity. Bentley, the patentee, went to Bingham Canyon, and defendant informed him that he, Bentley, “had no interest in there at all.” No attempt was made by Bentley, or any of Ms successors in interest, to take possession of the ground, and defendant has continually remained in possession of the premises embraced witMn lot 80, and used the same as a yard in connection with his blacksmith shop for the purposes hereinbefore mentioned. It appears that from the time defendant went into possession of lot 80 until about the time this action was commenced, plaintiff and its predecessors in interest drove over \\'a portion of the lot in hauling hay to and manure from the livery stable. They would also occasionally leave a vehicle, when not in use, upon the premises. Plaintiff, however, does not claim any title to or easement in the property by virtue of the use thus made of it. The claim made, if we correctly understand the position of counsel for plaintiff, is, that evidence of the use made of lot 80 by plaintiff and its predecessors tends to show that defendant was not the sole occupant of the property, and that therefore he conld not, and did not, acquire title to it by adverse possession. The evidence, without conflict, shows that the use made of the premises by plaintiff and its predecessors in no way interfered with defendant’s occupancy and use of the property. George H. Davis, a witness for defendant, testified that he resided in Bingham Canyon from 1873 until the fall of 18.82; that he owned and operated the livery stable mentioned; that neither he nor any one connected with the livery stable during that time claimed any title to or interest in the premises in controversy or any part thereof, and that defendant was the reputed owner of the property. The record also shows that T. B. Jones, one of the parties who succeeded to the rights conferred by the Valentine patent, and who was one of the parties through whom plaintiff deraigns its title, sent word to the occupying claimants of the land covered by the patent, before he parted with whatever interest he may have had in the property, that if they would get the land surveyed “he and his partners” would convey to each claimant the amount of ground claimed and occupied by such claimant that was within the patent; “that they (Jones and his partners) did not claim it.” In fact, the evidence shows that from 187 6 until the commencement of this action, a period of twenty-eight years, no one interfered with defendant in his possession and occupancy of the land in question. One of plaintiff’s predecessors in interest testified that he claimed to own the property from 1885 to 1898, when he sold it, in connection with the livery stable mentioned, to plaintiff; but there is no evidence that he ever asserted or made known his claim of ownership to defendant or to any other person. The land described in the Valentine patent was.not assessed for taxes, nor were any of the parties connected with that title ever assessed for land covered by the patent, prior to the year 1891. In ,1891 the entire forty acres covered by the patent was assessed at $160 in the name of Bentley, the patentee, and others holding undivided interests therein with him, the total tax being $1.39. The property was sold for these taxes. The same thing occurred again in 1892. Plaintiff in no way connects his title with these tax salee After the year 1892, until 1896, no taxes were assessed or levied against the land as described and embraced within tbe Valentine patent. From tbe year 1878, until 1891, defendant was assessed for and paid taxes on real estate in Bingbam Canyon, but no description of tbe real estate was given. During these years when tbe assessor called on defendant for tbe purpose of assessing bis property, defendant, in listing bis property, would point out to tbe assessor tbe land claimed and occupied by bim. Tbe record shows that tbe assessors, in their assessments of real estate for taxes in Bingbam Canyon from 1878 up to and including 1893, did not describe tbe property, but only gave tbe valuation. From 1893 until 1900 only tbe improvements were assessed. Tbe taxes assessed against lot 80, “Smith’s Survey” since 1900 have been paid by defendant. Tbe first complaint filed by plaintiff in this action (April 24, 1904) contains two counts. In tbe first count plaintiff claims title to tbe easterly portion of lot 80, and in tbe second count it claims ownership in common with defendant to tbe westerly portion. On January 15, 1907, nearly three years after filing its original complaint, plaintiff filed an amended complaint containing but one count in which it claims to be tbe sole and absolute owner of all of lot 80, and prays for a decree quieting its title to all of said lot. Both of these complaints, which were verified by A. V. Anderson as vice president of plaintiff company, were received in evidence. Tbe court found in favor of plaintiff upon tbe issues presented, and rendered\\' judgment quieting its title in tbe property. Defendant appeals. Weber & Olson for appellant. Dey & Hoppaugh for respondent. APPELLANT\\'S POINTS. In the early fall of 1879, plaintiff received a deed from Campbell for tbe particular piece of ground\\' embraced in Lot 80. This deed was lost by appellant in a fire which occurred in 1895, and which burned down bis blacksmith shop and all bis books and papars. It was the usual form of quit-claim deed, duly made and executed before a notary public and witnesses, and all circumstances of the formal making and execution of the deed are given. The witness could not, nor could he be expected to give the exact language of the deed; if he had undertaken to do so his testimony in this recpeet might be open to doubt or criticism, which is impossible as to any of the testimony given by appellant in this case. James Campbell, first party, by Hugh Campbell, his attorney in fact, conveyed this ground to appellant. The deed was made in the office of Henry Thompson, a notary public in Bingham Canyon, and was subscribed to before the notary and before two witnesses, and was formally acknowledged before the notary, who duly signed his name and affixed his seal to the acknowledgment. The deed described this ground, and witness remembered that it stated that the ground conveyed was twenty-five feet in width, and that it extended westerly from Carr Fork road to the mountain and adjoined the livery stable premises on the north. It referred to posts which showed the boundaries of the ground, one post at what is shown on the plat “G-” as the present southeast comer of Lot 8, Wilke’s survey, being also the southeast corner of Lot 80, Smith’s survey, on Carr Fork road; and one at the junction of main Bingham Canyon and Carr Fork road; being the northeast corner of Lot 80. Appellant remembered that it was in 1879 that he received this deed by reference to a book account showing that to have been the year when a fence was built along the north line of lot 80 from the rear corner of appellant’s blacksmith shop to the mountain. Hugh Campbell was the duly authorized attorney in fact for James Campbell. Under this deed appellant has claimed title since 1879. This proof of the lost deed is sufficient. Proof of possession for a period of nearly thirty years under claim of title being established, very slight additional circumstances are required to establish a lost deed under which title is claimed. (Scott v. Crouch, 24 Utah 377; Tlarbison v. School Dis., 89 Ho. 184; Perry v. Burton, 111 Illinois 138; Parles v. Caudle, 58 Texas 216.) RESPONDENT^ POINTS. Until tbe contents of a deed are proved tbe deed is not proved, and tbe proof should be clear and plenary. (Lampe v. Kennedy, 14 N. W., 43, 45; Thomas v. Bibble, *24 S. E., 24, 242; Capell v. Fagan, 11 Pa. 55; Gunner v. Pushor, 29 Atl. 1083; Louisville & Nashville Railroad Go. v. Boykin, IQ Ala. 560; Shackleford v. Bailey, 35 Ill. 387; Humphries v. Huffman, 33 Obio State, 395 404; Livingston v. Iron Company, 9 Wendell, 311, 511; Fugate v. Pierce, 49 Wo. 441, 441.) It is obvious where a deed containing no description of tbe land is relied on to give color of title that it will be ineffectual for that purpose. (Buswell Lim. and Adverse Possession, p. 353.) A deed is color of title only to tbe extent that the premises are described in tbe conveyance. (McFvoy v. Lloyd, 31 Wis., 142.) Tbe description is tbe most essential part of tbe deed under this statute, for it determines tbe extent of tbe constructive possession arising from tbe actual possession of a part. (Wilson v. Atkinson, 11 Cal., 48.5; Murphy v. Doyle, [Minn.] 33 N. W. 220, 221.) 1 Pioneer Investment & Trust Co. v. Board of Education of Salt Lake City, 35 Utah 1, 99 Pac. 150; Toltec Ranch Company v.

       "  'case_summary': 'Busby v. Littlefield & als. It is a general rule in equity that when a replication is put in to an answer, and the parties proceed to a hearing, all the allegations of the answer which are responsive to the hill will he taken as true, unless they are disproved by two witnesses, or by one witness with corroborating circumstances. When, however, the answer sets up affirmative allegations in opposition to, or in avoidance of the plaintiff’s demand, the answer is no proof of the facts stated, and the defendant is hound to establish them by independent testimony. Where a plaintiff filed his bill to re-form a deed given by him, alleging that by the deed one hundred feet were conveyed on a certain street, whereas it should have conveyed thirty feet only, and the defendant in his answer admitted that there was a mistake in the deed, but “ affirmed” that the deed should have been for thirty-two feet — it would seem that the defendant would be bound to establish his allegation by independent evidence. Equity will reform a mistake made in drawing a deed, and may order a party holding land by a conveyance covering by mistake more than was purchased and intended to be conveyed, to release all claim to that which is unjustly held. In Equity. Tbe following case is stated by tbe bill: ,Tbat, on tbe 29tb day of August, 1844, tbe complainant purchased of John Trickey certain premises in Dover, being a lot of land one hundred feet square, with buildings thereon, situated on tbe west side of Chestnut street, and afterwards put up another set of buildings on tbe northerly part of tbe lot, at an expense of about $1,000, and appropriated thirty feet front and rear, and one hundred feet deep, of tbe whole lot to these buildings ; and that be has always occupied tbe remaining seventy feet of tbe lot, with the buildings thereon, until the filing of the bill, which was in May, 1853. That, on the 29th of August, 1850, the complainant sold to John S. Jordan, one of the defendants, the thirty foot lot, with the house and barn thereon standing, for $1,200, and gave him a warranty deed of the same, subject to what was due on certain mortgages, which sum J ordan Ayas to pay. That, in giving the deed to J ordan, a mistake was made by the attorney who dreAV it, and instead of describing the thirty feet, which was all that was sold, the whole one hundred feet square were conveyed by the deed. That the complainant and Jordan both supposed that only the thirty feet Avere conveyed, and Jordan accordingly took possession of only the thirty feet, and the buildings thereon standing, and occupied that part, while the complainant occupied the remaining seventy feet. That Jordan so continued in the occupancy of the thirty feet till the 23d of March, 1852, when he sold to Crawford, another of the defendants ; the bargain between them being for the thirty feet and no more. The deed of Jordan to Crawford was a warranty deed, and referred, for a description of the premises conveyed, to the deed of the complainant to Jordan. The bill then alleges that Jordan by his deed supposed and believed that he was conveying, and Crawford knew that Jordan intended to convey, only the thirty feet, with the house and barn thereon, and that Crawford paid Jordan for only the thirty feet. That during the occupancy by Crawford, the complainant built a fence on the line between the thirty and seventy feet lots, which fence was standing at the time of the filing of the bill. That Crawford occupied the thirty feet and the buildings thereon -until the 28th of July, 1852, when he sold and conveyed the same by Avarranty deed to Littlefield, the other defendant. For a description of the premises conveyed, the deed of Jordan to Crawford was referred to. The bill then charges that Littlefield, at the time he took the deed of Crawford, knew that there was a mistake in the deed of Busby to Jordan, and that in right and equity the southerly part of the lot, being the seventy feet on Chestnut street by one hundred feet deep, was the property of the complainant. But notwithstanding this, Littlefield claims to hold and to own the whole premises ; and on the first day of January, 1853, he sued out a writ of entry against the complainant for the whole lot, and is prosecuting the suit for the recovery of the same. That, on the 21st of May, 1853, the complainant requested Littlefield to release and quitclaim to him the southerly part of the lot, being the seventy feet, but he refused to comply with the request. The bill prays that Littlefield may be compelled to release and quitclaim to the complainant the seventy feet, and that the complainant may be established in his title to the same. Also, for an injunction against Littlefield from the further prosecution of his writ of entry. There is, likewise, a prayer for general relief. Jordan, in his answer, admits that Busby bought the whole lot of Trickey, and soon after erected a house and barn on the northerly end of the lot; and that Busby has for many years resided in the house on the southerly end of the lot; but he denies that there was ever any division of the lots, or any particular tract assigned to the house on the northerly end, or that it was ever fenced or marked off in any manner. He admits that in July or August, 1850, he bargained with Busby for the northerly end of the Trickey lot for the sum of $1,200 ; but he “ affirms” that when Busby first proposed to sell the premises, he said he would sell a lot thirty-two feet in width on Chestnut street, and running back the same width across the lot; that he and Busby went together to examine the house and lot, and paced across the front. That he then told Busby that the line would come close to the back side of his shed on his lot, and Busby replied that if it came so close to the shed that the eaves should drop on his land, he could compel him to move the shed ; but he thought the line would clear the shed, and leave room for his folks to pass round behind it. That some time after this they agreed upon the terms of the sale, and Busby procured a deed of the premises to be drawn. That Busby brought the deed, which was hastily run over by them, and very little attention was paid to the boundaries, and that neither the mistake alleged in the bill, nor the error as to the thirty-two feet, was discovered by either of the parties till long after the execution and delivery of the deed. He then admits that the description of the land in the deed to him is erroneous, as charged in the bill; that it was not the intention of either of the parties that the whole of the Trickey lot should be conveyed; but he says that it was expressly agreed between Busby and himself that a lot thirty-two feet in width off the northerly end should be conveyed, and that no other lot was ever sold by Busby or bought by him. He admits that after the delivery of the deed, he took possession of the house, and occupied the premises under the deed, and that Busby occupied the house on the southerly end of the lot, as alleged in the bill; but he denies that the lots were ever divided or fenced off, or that there was ever any particular occupation or use up to any particular line or mark on either side. He then alleges that some months after he had taken possession of the premises, he discovered for the first time that the deed purported to convey only thirty feet, and that he was surprised at the discovery. He admits that the description of the land in his deed to Crawford is truly set forth in the bill — the description being a reference to the deed of Busby to Jordan — that Crawford, by his tenants, took possession of the house under his deed, and afterwards sold and conveyed the premises to Littlefield at the time and in the manner alleged. He states that before he signed and swore to his answer, Littlefield executed to him a release of all claim by reason of the deed of Jordan to Crawford, and of the deed from Oravford to Littlefield. The defendant, Crawford, says that he purchased the house and lot of Jordan. That he had various conversations with Busby about the purchase, and mentioned the narrowness of the lot as an objection to it; that it was said that the lot was thirty-two feet wide, in the presence of Busby, and that Busby never denied it. That he never knew or suspected that the lot was not so described in the deed from Busby to Jordan, till he carried it to an attorney to get a deed drawn from Jordan to himself. That it was then discovered by himself and the attorney that Jordan’s lot was described as being only thirty feet in width, though in fact the description would cover the whole of the lot conveyed by Trickey to Busby. That feeling sure that a deed from Jordan under the circumstances would convey to him the thirty-two feet, he procured a deed to be-drawn in the manner alleged in the bill, which Jordan after-wards executed and delivered. That being at that time on good terms with Busby, and in partnership with him, he supposed the mistakes would be rectified by Busby whenever the matter should be called up, but no attempt was ever made by him to correct the error. That in a few weeks thereafter the shop and tools and stock of Busby and himself were destroyed by fire, and the partnership was soon after dissolved. That he conveyed the premises to Littlefield in the manner alleged in the bill, at the same time informing him of the understanding he had with Busby and Jordan about the size of the lot; and also informing him of the character of the deeds from Busby to Jordan, and from Jordan to himself. He admits, generally, the other matters stated in the bill, but “ affirms” that Busby contracted to sell thirty-two feet to Jordan, and not thirty, as alleged. He also denies that any partition fence was ever made between the lots, or that any particular appropriation was made for the northern house and lot. He states further, that before signing and swearing to his answer, Littlefield released him from all claim by reason of the deed from himself to Littlefield. Littlefield, in his answer, states the case, upon his information and belief, in substantially the same way as Jordan. Fie then adds that Busby told him that he had intended to sell Jordan a lot thirty-two feet wide, but that his deed read only thirty feet; that he had, however, agreed with Jordan to make the deed right according to their original agreement. He admits that his deed conveys the whole lot, and that he never bought the whole, but says that he took the deed in that way so that he might be able to compel Busby to convey the thirty-two feet. He says that he is ready to quitclaim to Busby the sixty-eight feet, and has placed upon the files of the court a deed to that effect, to be delivered whenever Busby will convey to him the thirty-two feet. He- omits to state the consideration paid by him to Crawford, as interrogated in the bill. Other matters are introduced into the bill and answers, but they do not appear to be material to the decision of the case. To these answers there are general replications. The evidence in the case consists of the testimony of John H. White, Esq., who made the deed from Busby to Jordan; of James M. Boss and Charles L. Smith, who witnessed the deed ; of Parker Clay, the owner of the land in the rear of the whole Busby land; of George W. Hayes, a tenant of Busby, who resided in the house on the southerly end of the lot; and of William B. Wiggin, a surveyor. This evidence has all been taken on the part of the complainant, no evidence having been taken by the defendants. Mr. White testifies in substance that he drew the deed from Busby to Jordan, and took the acknowledgment; that he had the deed of Trickey to Busby to draw it by; that on one occasion, which was either when he delivered the deed to Busby or took the acknowledgment, Busby and Jordan were both present at his office, and he then read the deed over to them; that he is quite positive about it; that he never heard any thing about the thirty-two feet, and that neither of the defendants has ever been to see him about any mistake in the deed as to thirty feet or thirty-two feet. James M. Boss testifies that he was present and witnessed the deed from Busby to Jordan; that it was at Busby’s house ; that Busby and his wife, Jordan and his wife, himself, and Charles Smith, the other witness, were in the room together at the time ; that Busby and wife signed the deed; that Charles Smith declined to sign as a witness until he heard the deed read; that Busby then read it in a distinct voice, and all appeared to give attention to the reading ; that Smith then signed ás a witness with him ; that he recollects the consideration was $1,200, and that the lot was thirty feet front and rear, and one hundred deep ; that he does not recollect the boundaries. He gives as a reason why he recollects the consideration and the size of the lot, that when he hears a man make a bargain he wants to know how much he pays, and what he gets for his money. He says.that the parties did not appear to be in haste. Challes L. Smith states the matter substantially the same as Ross. He says that he witnessed the deed; that he declined to witness it until it was read, that he might know what he was signing ; that the deed was thirty feet front, and running back one hundred feet, to Parker Clay’s land ; that he heard nothing about thirty-two feet from any one ; that Jordan attended to it when it was read. George W. Hayes says that he has occupied the easterly part of the house, as the tenant of Busby, next to Chestnut street, on the seventy foot part of the lot, since the fall of 1849 — Busby occupying the other part of it; that he has cultivated the land on Chestnut street for five years past, running to the bank of the Littlefield house, on the northerly part of the whole lot, and that no objection was ever made to his so doing by either of the defendants, or by any one. That in the spring or summer of 1850 he built a temporary fence, running from Chestnut street, and terminating about two feet north of the corner of the wood-shed, and put in a gate between the corner of the shed and the fence. That it was built of boards and joist, about three feet high. That he supposed he was putting it on the line between the two lots. That it was built close to the banking of the Littlefield house, and that there was a passway of about two feet between the wood-shed and the banking, which was used by his family and Busby’s. That he never heard of any objection from either of the defendants to his making the fence. That it stood there two or three years, and was taken down by himself, by degrees, as he wanted to use some of the boards, and that there is now there the remains of one of the posts. Parker Clay, the owner of the land adjoining on the west, says, that for four years past there has been a cross-fence on the thirty foot line, and that Busby has cultivated the land up to the fence; that he has been upon the lot a number of times, and knows it to be so. William B. Wiggin testifies that he surveyed the whole lot on the 30th of May, 1856, and made a plan of the same, which he annexes to his deposition. He describes the lot and the buildings thereon. Says that the thirty-two feet line comes close to Busby’s back buildings, so that the eaves of the wood-house project over the line three inches ; that the thirty foot line is two feet from Busby’s wood-house, and three feet and a half from the Littlefield house; that the Littlefield house is situated in the center of the thirty foot lot, leaving three and a half feet on each side of it, which form an embankment. That there are the remains of an old fence on the thirty foot line, with eight posts standing; also a notch in the fence on the Clay line, at the terminus of the thirty foot line, which has been there apparently for some years.

One who digs a pit on land so that, by the operation of natural and ordinary causes, which he takes no precaution to guard against, the land of another falls into the pit, is liable to an action by the latter for the injury to his land in its natural condition, but not for injuries to buildings or improvements thereon, such as fences and shrubbery, without proof of actual negligence; the measure of damages is the actual loss of and injury to the soil; and it is immaterial that the defendant is not the owner of the land dug upon, but removes the soil therefrom for his own benefit by permission of the owner thereof. Tort for injuries to the plaintiff’s land by the excavation of adjoining land by the defendant. The case was submitted to the Superior Court, and, after judgment for the plaintiff, to this court on appeal, on an agreed statement of facts as follows: “ The plaintiff was owner of a parcel of land in a populous portion of that part of Boston, lately Roxbury, as described in her writ, bounded on the southwesterly side by the land of one Webb. On this land of the plaintiff, but immediately adjoining the division line, was a fence, and near to it a few currant bushes and certain modern structures. The two parcels in their natural condition made a knoll, the highest part of which was at or near the division line. “ Webb, the owner of the adjoining lot, under an agreement with one Gillighan, gave him permission to remove the soil of his land down to a grade of the street on its northwesterly side, on which both lots were located. Webb gave Gillighan the right to go up to, but not within two feet of the plaintiff’s fence. Webb had no other connection with the acts complained of. “ Gillighan for a consideration gave permission to the defendant to remove a portion of this said soil, and under that license the defendant removed all the soil that was removed nearest to and along the line of the plaintiff’s land, and the removal of which, it was alleged, caused the damage complained of. Gillighan gave the license to the defendant under the same restrictions as to 6 not within two feet of the plaintiff’s fence,’ as Webb had imposed upon him. “ The depth to which the grade of this adjoining land was lowered by the defendant against the plaintiff’s lot was at its greatest measure some ten feet, and at its lowest, some five feet. The soil of the plaintiff’s lot fell along the whole length of her line to the width of some two or three feet at the top, taking with it the fence and shrubbery upon it. The weight of the plaintiff’s structures near the line did not contribute to the falling away of the soil. The defendant left a bank of earth on the Webb lot against the plaintiff’s land along the whole line, but it was not in all parts two feet wide at the top. There was no falling away of the soil at the time the defendant ceased his work, which was in the fall of the year, about the 23d of October. The bank left by the defendant was rendered insufficient to hold the soil of the plaintiff in its natural condition by the effect of rains and frost. The bank began to give way under the effect of rains and frost at once, but the soil of the plaintiff was not actually disturbed till the month of March in the spring following the fall when the work of the defendant was ended. “ The damages occasioned to the plaintiff by loss of and injury to her soil alone, caused by the acts of the defendant, amount to ninety-five dollars. To put the plaintiff’s land into its former condition, and so maintain it by means of a retaining wall, (which I find to be the best method of accomplishing that result,) would cost the sum of five hundred and seventy-five dollars; and to replace the fence and shrubs would cost the further sum of forty-five dollars. The difference between the market value of the plaintiff’s lot of land as affected by the act of the defendant, and what its market value would be had it not been deprived of its natural supports, (without taking into account the unavoidable disadvantage to the plaintiff, which must have followed from the lawful cutting down of the adjoining lot, though her soil had not been disturbed thereby,) would be the equivalent of and fully compensated by the cost of putting her land back into the same condition it was before, or the sum of the two amounts last named, namely, six hundred and twenty dollars.” Upon the foregoing facts, the court was to enter such judgment as it should deem proper.

At common law the owner of cattle was required to keep them on his own land or respond in damages for their trespasses. 2. It seems that the early rule in this State required a person farming land to protect his crops with a good and sufficient fence from cattle lawfully running at large. 3. It also seems, that when township organization was adopted and townships given power to prohibit the running at large of stock, in case of all townships that did so prohibit it, the rule last referred to ceased to be applicable, and the owners of stock became liable for their trespasses as at the common law. 4. This court holds that the act of July 1, 1874, concerning the running at large of stock, abrogated the Illinois rule, and that by its force and effect, the common law rule at once revived. [Opinion filed December 3, 1891.] Appeal from the Circuit Court of Christian County; the Hon. Jacob Fouke, Judge, presiding. Messrs. J. C. McBride and John G. Drennan, for appellant. In 1874 an act was passed entitled, “An act to revise the law in relation to permitting animals to run at large,” which provided a penalty against those who should suffer their animals of the species of horse, mule, etc., to run at large. ¡Revised Statutes, Chapter 8, Section 1. This statute applied only to those who suffered or permitted such animals to run at large, and had no- application to such animals escaping against the will of the owner and without his fault or neglb gence, as in this case at bar, and set forth in the said propositions of law submitted to the court. Kinder v. Gillespie, 63 Ill. 88; The Town of Collinsville v. Scanland, 58 Ill. 221. In the case of Frederick v. White, 73 Ill. 590, the right of recovery was based squarely upon the fact that defendant suffered his stock to run at large repeatedly. “ If no reasonably prudent man would have foreseen this result, then the appellant could not be liable, even had the \\'bull broken out without any fault of appellee or her agent. Only reasonable effort to restrain the bull [horses] was required.” Weide v. Thiel, 9 Ill. App. 226. It has been held that this statute did not relieve railroad companies from fencing their roads. O. & M. R. R. Co. v. Jones, 63 Ill. 472. In the enactment of this statute the legislature did not pretend to relieve owners of land from fencing the same. In the revision of 1874 this section 20, of chapter 54, Illinois Statutes, upon which appellant bases his action, was retained, which provides: “ If any horse, mule or ass, or any neat cattle, hogs or sheep, or other domestic animals shall break into any person’s inclosure, the fence being good and sufficient, the owner of such animal or animals shall be liable, in an action of trespass, to make good all damages to the owner or occupier of the inclosure. This section shall not be construed to require such fence in order to maintain an action for injury done by animals running at large contrary to law.” Applying any reasonable rule of construction, this section means simply, that the owner of stock shall be liable for all dam ages where the owner of the inclosure has it surrounded by a good and sufficient fence, and makes one exception only, and that is that the fence shall not be necessary to maintain the action if the stock is running at large contrary to law; but in all other cases the fence is absolutely necessary to entitle the owner of the premises to recover damages. Applying this rule, as laid down by our Supreme Court and above cited, as to what constitutes a running at large, there must be some act of permission, omission or negligence by the owner of the stock before such stock can be said to be running at large contrary to law. It may be contended, as it was on the trial below, that all stock at large, regardless of the circumstances of their escape, are running at large contrary to law. Such is evidently not the meaning of this section upon which appellee seeks to recover, for if it were, the section would simply provide that-any horse, mule, etc., entering upon the inclosure of another, the owner of such animal should make good all damages to the owner or occupier of such inclosure, and would not need the qualification, “the fence being good and sufficient,” or proviso that, “this section shall not be construed to require such fence in order to maintain an action for injuries done by animals running at large contrary to law,” both of which are contained in the section referred to, and we submit that to adopt the construction contended for by appellee would be a reflection upon the legislature adopting such language to express its meaning; and we ask the court to bear in mind that the chapters “In relation to animals running at large,” and “ In relation to fences ” were both revised in 1874, and are to be considered together and of equal dignity in construing them, and the construction that will permit both statutes to remain should be adopted. It is clear that the construction suggested by appellant allows both to remain; any other repudiates one of them. Messrs. Ricks & Creighton, for appellee. The evidence shows that at the time in question the horses and mules of appellant got out in the night and were upon the lands of appellee and witness Overton. The gate was open. Part of them were put back in the pasture in the night, and after breakfast those put up were out again, the gate still closed and the riders off near the gate. We think the fact that this stock got out and damaged appellee’s corn, with the agreement as to damages, makes the case for him. In McCormick v. Tate, 20 Ill. 334, the court say: “ By the common law every man was bound to keep his cattle on his own land or respond in damages for their trespasses.’’ And it was one of its rules that no man is bound to fence his close against an adjoining held, but every man is bound to keep his cattle in his own field at his peril. And if the common law is in force in this State, th\\'e above is a sufficient-answer to the labored argument of counsel for appellant, that he is not liable because he did not permit or suffer his stock to run at large, or was not guilty of negligence in the common acceptation of the term. Seely v. Peters, 5 Gilm. 142, is cited and relied upon by appellant. Mr. Justice Pillsbury, in Lee v. Burk, 15 Ill. App. 651, uses the following language: “Sec. 1, of Chap. 8, of the Kevised Statutes of 1874, changes the rule declared in Seely v. Peters, by prohibiting the running at large of cattle in the absence of a vote of the people of the county allowing them to do so. We think the effect of this statute is to practically re-enact the common law upon the subject, and that now in this State, in any locality where no vote has been had, every man must keep his cattle from his neighbor’s premises or respond in damages for injuries committed by them.” And in Birket v. Williams, 30 Ill. App. 45, substantially the same language is used by Mr. Justice Lacey in rendering the opinion of the court. But counsel for appellant seeks to dispose of the last two cases with two assertions: 1. That Sec. 20, Chap. 54, K. S., was not considered in them. 2. That they are only binding in the particular cases. As to the first assertion, we reply that See. 20, Chap. 54, was not considered in this case, and ought not to be; that section applies to those counties only where certain animals may lawfully, by vote of the people, run at large, and the exception applies to bulls, jackasses, and such animals as can not be lawfully at large. To the second assertion, we say that if the principle upon which those cases were decided is correct, they are binding on all courts. And the eminent source of their enunciation assures us that they are well founded. If it were clever in counsel to advise the court that appellee’s case is based on Sec. 20, Chap. 54, Id. S., 1874, it strikes us as unkind in them to then try to deprive us of the solid foothold we have maintained with this case through two courts, and it reminds us very much of the child that built the cob house that he might have the pleasure of knocking it down. Kinder v. Gillespie, 63 Ill. 88, The Town of Collinsville v. Scanland, 58 Ill. 221, and Weide v. Thiel, 9 Ill. App. 226, are cited by appellant in support of the proposition that he is not liable unless guilty of negligence, or unless he suffered his stock \"to run at large. These cases were cited and insisted upon in Birket v. Williams, supra, and the court, on page 454, says of them: “ The most of the cases cited are where a penalty is sought to be recovered, and have no application; the case above cited in 9 Ill. App., arose under a special statute against bulls running at large, and has no application.” Frederick v. White, 73 Ill. page 590, and O. & M. R. R. Co. v. Jones, 63 Ill. 472, \"cited upon the same proposition, need only to be read to determine their inapplicability.',\n",

       "  'case_summary': \"Lydia S. Cutting, as Executrix, etc., of Heyward Cutting, Deceased, Appellant, v. Henry Burns, Respondent. Constructive possession attends the legal title—proof of undisturbed possession — a tenant by sufferance obtaining a pretended conveyance from, a third person — proof of adverse possession where no written instrument exists — a temporary fence — service of notice to quit, when waived. A person having the legal title to land is constructively in possession thereof, unless the premises are in the actual hostile possession of another under a claim of title. Proof of mere undisturbed possession for twenty years or more does not satisfy the requirements of section 369 of the Code of Civil Procedure in relation to adverse possession. Where the,adverse claimant is in possession as a tenant on sufferance or by license of the owner of the legal title, a mere pretended conveyance from a third per- , son affords an insufficient basis for an adverse possession. ' An adverse possession not founded upon a written instrument must be shown ' to have been hostile in its inception. Evidence that the adverse claimant maintained for a few years about a house . upon the premises a fence which was afterwards destroyed and was not replaced, is not sufficient to establish a substantial inclosure of the land or any part thereof for the purposes of adverse possession. In a summary proceeding to obtain possession of real estate, the omission of the plaintiff to prove the seiwice of the notice required by section 2236 of the Code . of Civil Procedure is waived where the defendant has appeared generally in the proceeding, has joined issue and has gone to a hearing on the merits; in any event, it is hot available to the defendant for the first time on an appeal.

       "  'case_summary': \"CHARLESTON. Starks v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co. Submitted October 26, 1915. Decided November 9, 1915. 1. Railroads — Sight of Way — Duty to Fence. In absence of contract stipulation or express statutory provision, a railroad company is not required to fence its right of way. Section 14, eh. 42, Code, requires such enclosure only when the way is acquired by condemnation. (p. 95). 2. Same — Injury to Trespassing Stoclc — Liability—Direction of Verdict. Although a carrier is chargeable for injury to stock trespassing on its traek, if seen by its agents, or if in the exercise of ordinary diligence sueh agents could have seen the stock, in time to prevent injury thereto; yet if, by reason of the performance of other essential duties, proved by plaintiff and not contradicted, defendant offering no proof, sueh agents, though reasonably diligent, did not see the stock in time to avoid injuring them, defendant is not liable; nor, in such circumstances, is a directed verdict for defendant erroneous, (p. 96). 3. Same — Negligence—Presumption. The paramount duty of a carrier’s agents is to protect the property entrusted to them; and their actual and necessary attention to performance of such duty, when established by proof not eontra- . dieted, does not authorize an inference of negligent operation, (p. 96). 4. Same — Negligence—Defective Equipment — Presumption—Proof. Nor does the actual employment of the agents’ time in doing what the situation demanded, when usual and essential, necessarily imply defectiveness of equipment, furnished by the carrier. To constitute negligence, warranting recovery therefor, the defect must affirmatively appear from the proof, (p. 98). 5. NegligbNCe — Submission to Jury — Eviáenoe. While negligence is generally a mixed question of law and fact, for jury determination only, yet when the negligence averred is not proved, or, as in this ease, disproved, by plaintiff, the question need not be submitted to a jury. (p. 99). 6. Same — Declaration—Beguisites—Specific Act. A declaration need not specify the particular negligent act or defect relied on as the basis of a recovery.

Homestead in Town—Designation to Other Use.—Ceasing to use a store house and leasing it from year to year is an abandonment of the homestead exemption. See example. 8. Use of Lot in Connection with Home.—See facts where held that occupation and use of part of a lot as horse and wood yard in connection with the residence adjoining kept up its character as homestead and its exemption from execution, although enclosed with houses leased so as to be abandoned as parts of the homestead. Appeal from Kinney. Tried below before Hon. Winchester Kelso. Suit brought March 7, 1888, by appellee. B. Oppenheimer & Co. caused an execution under a valid j udgment rendered in their favor against appellee, Fritter, in the County Court of Kinney County, to be levied upon parts of lots 4 and 5, in block 6, in the town of Brackett, in Kinney County, which were legally sold by the sheriff to appellants, and deed was executed to them for the same. Plaintiff below, the appellee Fritter, claimed the land sold as a part of his homestead. He brought this suit to establish his homestead rights, and to have the deed canceled, to be quieted in his possession, etc. . Defendants answered admitting that they had bought the land under the execution sale, but denied that it was a part of plaintiff’s homestead. The form of the petition in the first part of it was as in trespass to try title, but in addition thereto he set up the fact of the levy and sale, that the deed was a cloud upon his title, and the fact that the land was a part of his homestead in the town of Brackett. The court overruled the general demurrer to the petition, and upon the evidence rendered judgment for the plaintiff sustaining the homestead claim, and canceled the deed. To the action of the court in overruling the general demurrer appellants assign error, upon the ground that the suit is in the nature of trespass to try title.; in which a deed can not be canceled.. Other assignments, in effect, are that the court erred in finding that the lots were exempt from forced sale as a- homestead at the time of the levy and sale, and especially in holding that that part of lot 5 on which is erected a rock house known as the restaurant was so exempt as a part of the residence homestead; also in holding that the business houses and lots had been only temporarily rented by plaintiff, because the question of whether the renting was temporary did not depend upon the intention of plaintiff to occupy the same again as a business homestead, when the evidence showed that he had not used it as such nor as a part of his family residence for years; nor did it depend upon the fact that he was using the rents for the support of his family, nor upon what plaintiff might think was a temporary renting, nor on its present value. The following is a plat of the premises: NORTH STREET The testimony given by plaintiff is in the opinion. The conclusions of fact as filed by the court are that plaintiff built a business house on the southwest corner of lot 5 in 1868; married in 1873 and moved on the lots, and has since continuously resided on them with his family as his homestead; that he failed in business in 1875, and has not used the business house himself since; that he has from time to time rented the business house to tenants when he could get one to occupy it, and when not occupied by tenants he used it for the comfort and convenience of his family, the renting being for the purpose of maintainance of his family; that both lots are fifty-five varas square; a partition fence between the dwelling and the business house, erected for the better enjoyment and protection of the home house and lot, and that the other part of the lot was used for horse lot and wagon lot for the stock of plaintiff ■ and his family; that all the property except the business house has been continuously used for homestead purposes, and the business house was used as before stated; that the entire property is worth less than $2000; that there are no outhouses or conveniences sufficient for the comfort of the family, and that the whole property is hardly adequate for the family wants; that the execution was on .that part of the lot west of the fence; and that plaintiff has no other property than that in question, which is necessary for the use of the family, consisting of himself, wife, and six children. The court then concludes as the law of the case that the temporary renting of the business house on the homestead lots was not of such a character as to render it subject to forced sale, and that plaintiff should recover. A. A. Dial and I. L. Martin, for appellants. 1. This action is brought in the nature of trespass to try title, when in truth it is a suit to cancel a sheriff’s deed, as is most clearly shown by the original petition filed herein. We are not willing to concede that the action of trespass to try title is the proper remedy in this character of suit, especially where the question of title is not an issue. Hence we contend that the general demurrer should have been sustained. 2. With all due respect we submit that the findings of the court are not sustained by the evidence as we find it in the record or statement of facts. The language of appellee is “that he has constantly had them (meaning the premises sold) rented out at all times whenever he could get a tenant for them;” that he used the rent derived from them for the support of his family. True, he stated he used the open lot in rear of stores to put his horse and buggy in, but admitted that some of his renters had had exclusive control of the vacant parts of the lots for wagon and camp yards. Medlenka v. Downing, 59 Texas, 32; Shryock v. Latimer, 57 Texas, 674; Wynne v. Hudson, 66 Texas, 8; Stringer v. Swenson, 63 Texas, 13. 3. A place to exercise the calling or business of the head of a family is the place or house in which such calling or business is carried on. There is nothing in the record to show that the appellee has pursued any calling or business since his failure in 1874 or 1875. On the contrary, he states that he had not pursued any such calling or business. Hence we contend that it is immaterial whether he rented the business houses temporarily- or permanently, nor does it matter what the intention of appellee may have been. The fact that he was renting the buildings and using the revenues arising from such rents is conclusive that he was not using the premises as either a homestead or place of business. The value of the premises does not affect their liability to levy and forced sale. Wynne v. Hudson, 66 Texas, 8; Stringer v. Swenson, 63 Texas, 12; Shryock v. Latimer, 57 Texas, 679; Medlenka v.

At the time of the execution of a mortgage persons were in possession of several of the parcels of the land mortgaged, claiming under contracts of purchase from the mortgagor, and had paid part of the purchase money. Some had built fences around their lots, and were cultivating them. Others had built, houses on theirs, and were living in them. Held, that their possession was sufficiently open and patent to put the mortgagee on inquiry, and to charge him with notice of all that he might have learned by such Inquiry. 0. Same. Nor is the mortgagee entitled to a lien for the portion of the purchase money unpaid at the time the mortgage was recorded, in the absence of actual notice of the mortgage to the purchasers, as under Model. Dig. Fla. p. 215, § 6. the recording of a mortgage is only notice to subsequent purchasers and creditors. 3, Same—Mortgageable Interest. The mortgagor had purchased the land conveyed by the mortgage, but the vendor re1 ained the deed subject to the payment of the purchase price. At the time of the execution of the mortgage he had neither title nor possession. Afterwards he offered to sell the land to D.. as the property of his vendor, giving no notice of the mortgage, hut furnishing an abstract showing the title m the vendor. D. purchased the land, and received upon payment of the purchase money the unrecorded deed to the mortgagor and a deed from the latter, both of which were recorded. Held, that the mortgagor had no mortgageable interest in the land, and that D. was not bound by the record of the mortgage. 4 Same—Description—Reformation. A mortgage described two lots as “lots 13 and 14 of Burbridge’s addition. ” The hill for foreclosure alleged that it was the intention to convey 'Tots Í3 and 14 of block 1, in Burbridge’s addition to Jacksonville. ” It appeared that there were 10 blocks in Burbridge’s addition to Jacksonville, each containing lots numbered 13 and 14. -Whiie the record showed that the mortgagor hail title at the time of the mortgage to lots 13 and 14 of block 1, it also showed that he had in some manner dealt with lots 13 and 14 in block 2, and had at one time given a mortgage on them. Held, that the description was too indefinite to afford any notice to a subsequent bona fide purchaser of lots 13 and 14 in block 1, and that the mortgage would not be reformed as against him. In Equity. Bill for foreclosure of mortgage. In September, 1883, Elwood H. Buckman executed a mortgage to one Haynie to secure a loan of'$1,600, which, in November, 1886, Haynie assigned to complainant. This mortgage covered 400 acres of land in Sumter county, Fla. In March, 1884, said Buckman executed another mortgage to one Hayes, to secure a loan of $6,000, which was assigned by Hayes to complainant in September, 1884. This mortgage covered the same 400 acres of land; certain lots therein described as in Jacksonville, eight acres of land on St. John river near Jacksonville, and two lots in a suburb of Jacksonville, described in the mortgage as “lots 13 and 14, Burbridge’s addition,” all in Duval county, Fla., save said 400 acres. Said mortgages were duly recorded. After the execution and recording of these mortgages Buckman conveyed to the other defendants different portions of said mortgaged premises. As to the 400 acres there is practically no controversy. A portion of the 400 acres is subject to the lien of both mortgages. Certain of the defendants, who purchased lots in Jacksonville from Buckman, resist the foreclosure of the Hayes mortgage on their lots upon the ground that they were in possession of the several lots claimed by them under contracts to purchase them from Buckman before and at the time of the execution of the mortgage by Buckman to Hayes. The defenses set up by the other defendants are fully noticed in the opinion of the court. Buckman died after this bill was filed, and the suit revived against his personal representative.

A conveyance was executed and delivered in consideration of certain cash in hand, and covenants contained in the deed obligated the grantee, its successors and assigns, to construct and maintain an intake or passway for water from a river across the lands granted to adjacent lands of the grantor, and to maintain a backwater gate therein. The covenants affixed no obligation to pay either money, property, or services as a consideration for or in lieu of performance, but merely recited that the grantee agreed faithfully to perform. The grantee and its successor in title failed to perform this covenant, and the grantor brought suit to enforce a vendor’s lien against the land. Held, that the proceeding could not be sustained for the reason said covenants in no manner affixed an obligation to pay either money, property or services as a consideration for the land, but instead substituted a personal obligation to perform distinct undertakings.

This watergap1 and backwater gate, respondents concede was never, at any time built.

Adverse possession — evidence.—While it is true that, where title has once been acquired by adverse possession, it can not be divested by the mere recognition of another’s title, yet such recognition might be evidence to show that the holding of the claimant was not adverse, and it was error to charge the jury that such recognition could not be considered. (Page 413.) 2. Evidence — declarations of grantor. — Statements, made by one who was in possession of a strip of land, which recognized another’s interest therein would be competent against the former and his privies if made while he was holding the land; but like statements made by him after he had sold the lands are admissible only as contradictory of his statement in court. (Page 413.) 3. Adverse possession — effect of mistake as to boundary. — When a land owner, through mistake as to his boundary line, takes possession of land of an adjacent owner intending to claim only to the true boundary, such possession is not adverse, and, though continued for the statutory period, does not divest title; but when he takes possession of the land under the belief that he owns it, incloses it and holds it continuously for the statutory period under claim of ownership without any recognition of the possible right of another thereto on account of mistake in the boundary line, such possession is adverse, and, when continued for the statutory period, will divest the title of the former owner, who has been thus excluded from possession. (Page 414.) Appeal from Lee Circuit court; Hance N. Hutton, Judge; reversed. H. F. Roleson, for appellant. I. Where land belonging to coterminous proprietors is inclosed, the intention with which the possession was taken and held is controlling, because no title could be gained against the owner by mere possession. To bar an action for the recovery of land so held, the possession must be actual, open, notorious, hostile and exclusive, and accompanied by an intention to hold adversely to and in derogation of the rights of the true owner. The court should have given instruction 3 requested by appellant. 59 Ark, 626, 628; 80 Ark. 444; Id. 575. 2. The court in its charge to the jury made an erroneous application of the principle that one can not by a verbal declaration divest himself of a title already acquired. This, is illustrated by instructions 3, 4, 5 and 6. The gist and substance of adverse possession is the intent with which the parties hold; yet, under these instructions, one who has remained in possession for over seven years might with impunity declare that he intended only to claim to the true line, yet such declaration would not be admissible as evidence against him to show the intention with which he had held. The signed statements made by Lynch, together with his verbal statements, were admissible for the purpose of showing that his holding was not adverse.- 131 S. W. (Ark.) 456. S. H. Mann, for appellee. 1. From the undisputed facts in the case it appears that some twenty-one years before this suit was brought Lynch and Brown, owning adjoining tracts of land, caused a dividing line to be run by the county surveyor, and it was agreed between them at the time that this survey should mark the boundaries of their land. Pursuant thereto, Lynch at once put a fence on this line, cleared the land, built houses thereon and occupied the property as his own until his sale to Hines, and the latter occupied it for a year after his purchase until Hughes took possession. The line having been established by agreement between Lynch and Brown, and acquiesced in by the parties all these years, and valuable improvements made with reference thereto, the correctness of the line can not now be questioned. 75 Ark. 400; 36 S. W. (Ark.) 184. Such an agreement is not prohibited by the statute of frauds. 23 Ark. 704; 5 Cyc. 931. Without reference to the correctness of the instructions, the judgment, being right upon the facts of the case, should be affirmed. 91 Ark. 97; 64 Ark. 236. 2.. Instruction 3 requested by appellant was properly refused because it did not embrace the principle that possession of land may be adverse if it is inclosed and held under the belief and claim that it is the property of the holder in possession, even though the claim of title was the result of a mistake as to the boundaries. 59 Ark. 462. Moreover, the jury was fully instructed on the law.of adverse possession, and the court was not required to repeat instructions. 93 Ark. 548; Id. 313. 3. The court correctly charged the jury that the alleged statement made by Lynch as to the character of his possession could only go to his credit. 16 Cyc. 1167. If it be conceded that the surveyed line was not correct, Lynch’s title matured by adverse possession several years before this suit was brought. Any statements tending to a recognition to title in another, made by him thereafter, would not have the effect of divesting him of title previously acquired. • 80 Ark. 444; Id. 575.',\n",

[An actual seisin of the ancestor, within the time alleged m the writ, being proved, the tenant must show a rightful entry; but acquiescence for more than twenty years in the adverse possession and enjoyment of such tenant, is primó facie evidence of a rightful entry and possession under a lost deed. — En.j This was a writ of entry sur disseisin, in which the demandant counted upon the seisin of Josiah Newhall, his grandfather, within fifty years, and upon a disseisin of the said Josiah by Alexander Hopkins, who demised the same to the tenant. The land demanded is described in the writ as being in the rear of a certain dwelling-house, and as being about twenty feet in length, and in width two feet six inches at one end, and one foot at the other end. The tenant pleaded the general issue, that the said Alexander did not disseise the said Josiah, in manner and form as the demandant has complained, &c., which, being joined by the demand-ant, was tried, November term, 1806, before Parker, J.; from whose report it appears, that the demandant proved the seisin of his ancestor Josiah, on which he relied, only by the testimony of Henry Ncivhall, the brother of said Josiah, who stated that, more than forty years before the time when he testified, his brother Josiah owned and occupied the south-westerly part of a certain house and land, which their father, Elcazar Newhall, had before owned, and the noi tb-easterly part of which the said Eleazar had conveyed to the witness, who had understood that the said Eleazar had conveyed the part occupied by said Josiah to him. He further stated that his brother Josiah lived there about fifteen years, and that, during all that time, a fence ran from the centre of the rear of the house, on a line with the division wall of the same, to the rear of the lot, and that this fence was always considered by him and his brother to be the true division line between them; and that the said Alexander Hopkins afterwards built the fence farther in upon the south-westerly side, so as to enclose within his yard the land now demanded. No deed from Eleazar to Josiah was produced ; but it was proved that the books in which deeds were recorded from the 24 th of December, 1767, to the 5th of July, 1768, and from the [* 351 ] 27th of December, 1768, to the 19th of May, * 1769, have been missing from the office of the register of deeds for this county more than thirty years. The tenant claimed to hold the land demanded under conveyances, derivatively, from Henry Newhall, the witness, of the northwesterly part of the messuage formerly belonging to Eleazar New-. hall. Alexander Hopkins, who is alleged to be the disseisor, acquired the title to Henry Newhall’s part in 1766, at which time Josiah Newhall was in possession of the other part of the messuage. The person who erected the fence, which the witness Henry New-hall stated to encroach upon the land of Josiah, was produced as a witness by the tenant; and he testified that he built that fence twenty-eight or twenty-nine years before the time of the trial, and that no person forbade him, or directed him as to the line upon which it should be built. Upon these facts, the judge’s charge to the jury was in substance as follows : — That the demandant had left his case exceedingly barren of evidence, having shown no title to the land in question, but depending altogether upon an entry and occupation by his ancestor, many years ago; that, although the demandant had proved by a witness an actual seisin of the premises demanded in his ancestor, within the time set forth in the writ, such seisin might have been without right, and if so, he did not remain long enough in possession to acquire the right of possession; it being proved that Alexander Hopkins, who held the estate formerly of Henry Newhall, had entered upon him within twenty years after said Josiah became so seised. That the seisin of the said Josiah might have been originally wrongful, and if they could find, from the long continuance of the fence as it now stands, without complaint by those whose rights would have been prejudiced had it been improperly placed, or from any other evidence in the case, that the land demanded really belonged to that part of the estate of Eleasar Newhall which had come through Henry Newhall to the tenant, they had a right to find that the entry of Alexander Hopkins, alleged in the writ, was not a disseisin of the said Josiah * Newhall, but a lawful entry upon his own land, his [*352] right of entry not being lost, provided the title was in him. The judge also observed to the jury, that, the demandant having shown nothing but the mere possession of his ancestor for fifteen years, without producing any evidence of title, he did not think, under the circumstances of the case, that he was entitled to recover, but that the jury were to judge of the evidence, and return such a verdict as they should judge to be right upon the merits of the case. The jury found a verdict for the tenant; and the demandant moved for a new trial on the ground of the judge’s misdirection to the jury. The objections to the direction, as stated in the motion for a new trial, were, principally, that, the demandant having proved an actual seisin in his ancestor within fifty years, and the tenant not having offered any evidence tending to prove a right of entry in Alexander Hopkins at the time of the disseisin alleged, the demand-ant was entitled to a verdict; but the judge, notwithstanding, did not so direct the jury, but left it to them, under all the circumstances of the case, to find a verdict for the tenant, if they should think fit so to do. And that the judge further instructed the jury, that a mere actual seisin of the demandant’s ancestor named in the writ, without some evidence of the right of the ancestor so seised, was not sufficient to support this action, unless it were continued for some length of time. The cause stood continued upon this motion until March term, 1808, when it was argued by Jackson for the demandant, and Sullivan for the tenant. Jackson, in support of the motion for a new trial, insisted that, when the demandant had proved an actual seisin in the ancestor named in the writ, and within the time therein alleged, such evidence was prima facie sufficient, and could only be rebutted by proving a right of entry in the person named in the writ as the disseisor. Such seisin, although altogether without right, and of however short * duration, is sufficient against all [ * 353 ] the world, except the party first disseised and his heirs. Thus, if A disseise B, and within twenty years, or one year, C disseise A, the latter may maintain his writ of entry against C, and it is no excuse for him, that the original entry by A was without right. A writ of entry is calculated to disprove the title of the tenant, by showing the wrongful commencement of it, “ rightly concluding that, if the original title was wrongful, all claims derived from thence must participate of the same wrong.” It is not even averred in the writ or count, nor necessary to be proved by the demandant, that he had a good title, or a lawful, indefeasible estate. This principle will appear very clear, and the reason of it obvious, if we suppose a recent case instead of one so ancient as the case at bar. Suppose Josiah Newhall to be now in quiet possession of the land in question, and that Hopkins should this day enter and oust him ; it is manifest that Hopkins takes upon himself the burden of proving his right to make this entry. The party entering pursues his claim in that mode, and is in fact actor, like the plaintiff in any action at law. It is clear, then, that, if Josiah Newhall should to-morrow bring his writ of entry against Hopkins for the ouster here supposed, it would be sufficient for him to prove his own prior possession, in order to put Hopkins to show why he disturbed it Would it be sufficient for him to say that Newhall bad not a good title to the land, that his possession had wrongfully commenced within twenty years, or within any other period ? The answer would be obvious; it is the common learning of the country, that my possession, however wrongful, shall not be disturbed by i stranger. If this would be the rule in case of an action brought to-morrow, the same rule would apply to the same action whenever brought, unless barred by the statute of limitations, which allows the heir fifty years to bring this action ; and to say that the long continuance of possession under the ouster [ * 854 ] fortifies * the title of the tenant, and constitutes a legal defence, is attempting to be wiser than the law, which enacts that nothing less than fifty years possession shall be sufficient for this purpose. The supposed wrongful entry of Hopkins is the gist of the action, and the only defence that can be made on the general issue is to show that it was not wrongful, or that he had a right of entry. Put the case that Hopkins, instead of entering when he did, had deferred it to this time, and were now to consult counsel as to his remedy. On examining his claim, the first question would be, whether he had now a right of entry. If his right and title to the land were ever so clear and indisputable, yet if, from lapse of time, or any other cause, his right of entry were tolled, his counsel would advise him to commence an action. On the other principle, his remedy by bare entry would be equivalent to a writ of right, A man, having any sort of title or claim to land, might always enter, and, if sued; he might go into his whole title in his defence; and it he proved the “ most mere right,” he would prevail. This would abrogate and render nugatory all the learning as to the right of entry, and even our own statute limiting the exercise of that right For there is no other way of enforcing those rules but by a reentry, which would introduce endless confusion and quarrelling, as it may be continually repeated by each party ; or by a writ of entry, which , is calculated to test the propriety and legality of the entry. It is contended that, even if the jury had been satisfied, from any of the evidence in the case, that the land demanded really belonged to that part of the estate of Eleazar Newhall, which had come through Henry Newhall to the tenant, this was not sufficient to authorize them to find that Alexander Hopkins did not disseise the demand-ant’s ancestor. Because, although Eleazar Newhall or Henry New-hall might have had a right of entry upon Josiah New-hall, they could not convey that right to Hopkins; *and [ # 355 ] there is no room for a presumption that Hopkins had ever acquired the actual possession, lawfully and peaceably, from or through Henry Newhall. On the contrary, it was expressly proved by his testimony, and not contradicted, that, when he made the deed under which Hopkins claimed, he, Henry Newhall, was not seised of the demanded premises, but Josiah Newhall was seised. Sullivan, for the tenant, contended that Henry Newhall was improperly admitted as a witness at the trial. He was sworn to contradict the effect and operation of a deed in which he was the grantee, and also of a deed conveying a title from himself; and although his admission was not objected to at the trial, yet, if it is now apparent to the Court that he ought not to have been received, they will put his testimony out of the case; and but for his testimony, the demandant would be without a shadow of title to support his action. But as his testimony was before the jury, they were the proper judges of its credibility; and there is nothing to show that they gave the least possible credit to it. On this ground, then, there is no occasion for a new trial. But if he was properly admitted, and was a competent witness he did not prove the seisin of the demandant’s ancestor, so as to entitle the demandant to recover in this action. Although the writ of entry does not meddle with the right of property, yet the tenant may justify his entry by reason of title in himself; and the land is to be awarded to him who produces the clearest right to possess it. This writ shows the demandant’s title, and disproves the tenant’s possession by means of his entry. As, in persona! actions, the proof of what the plaintiff sets forth in his writ, and is material to his claim, must lie on him, so, in this case, the demandant must prove his ancestor seised, and himself to have that right under his ancestor which he alleges in his writ. Seisin means, not a mere naked possession or occupancy, but a tenancy of the freehold; and if the ancestor had [ * 356 ] * less than a freehold, the heir is not entitled to his writ of entry; since no one can be disseised unless he was before seised. From the very learned argument of Lord Mansfield, in delivering the opinion of the court in the case of Taylor vs. Horde, it is apparent that the positions of Littleton, relied on by the demandant, are applicable to the assize of novel disseisin, in which the demandant might elect to consider himself disseised, and do not apply to the more ancient writ of entry sur disseisin. The same point is confirmed by the court in the case of Doe vs. Horde. From these authorities it is very clear that the demand-ant must show his ancestor to have had a freehold estate; he must show a title, which is tantamount to the investiture of former times If a naked possession only be shown, it may as well be presumed an estate by sufferance at will, or for years, as a freehold; and, indeed, if a freehold need not be shown, the descendant of any one who occupied only as tenant at will is entitled to his writ of entry on his ancestor’s seisin, and may put a tenant, who has an undoubted title, to the vexation and expense of a lawsuit. The action stood over until this term for advisement; and now the opinion of the Court (except the chief justice, who did not sit in the cause) was delivered by (1) 3 Black.

It is not proper to try those issues upon exceptions to the master’s report. 2.

Railroads — Pence Law — Cattle-Shards.—The ordinary fence laws of Tennessee do not apply to railroad companies, and there is neither a common-law nor statutory obligation on them to construct or maintain cattle-guards for the protection of crops growing on the cultivated lands through which their roads pass. Neither was the act of 1875, e. 64, intended to apply to railroad companies, although the land on which the track is built is within “ one general enclosure,” made by joining- the fences of the farmer to the cattle-guards of the railroad. These laws were intended for adjoining land owners engaged in agriculture, who are mutually benefited as well as bound by them. 4. Same — Implied Contract. — In the absence of a contract, or charter obligation, or some statutory duty to maintain cattle-guards, none will be implied from the fact that the company has constructed them along the line of road where it enters and leaves cultivated fields, unless the lapse of time has raised the presumption of a grant or covenant:- 5. Contributory Negligence — Straying Animals — Duty of the Owner of the Crop. — The owner of crops, having knowledge that straying animals may pass over defective cattle-guards and destroy the ■ crops, cannot recover for their destruction without using every means an ordinarily prudent person would-use to protect them.

A turnpike corporation have aright to remove fences or other encroachments upon their road, and are not compelled to resort to1 a remedy by action. The making and filing of the map of the route of a turnpike road required to be made and filed, is not a condition precedent to the right to enter upon lands for the purpose of making the road. The map is but evidence of the rout of the road, and should be received as testr moiy, whenever made. Nor is it material that the commissioners appointed to lay out the road should be together at the time of their certifying the map, provided they acted together in the designation of the route of the road. Error from the Jefferson common pleas. Kelsey sued Estes in a justice’s court in trespass, for throwing down and removing 25 rods of fence. The defendant, under a notice subjoined to his plea, justified the act as the agent of Vincent Le Ray de Chaumont, stating that the fence .was removed from off a portion of a turnpike road, constructed by James Le Ray de Chaumont by virtue of an act of the legislature, of which portion of the road Vincent Le Ray was the lessee of James Le Ray. The cause was tried, and the defendant had a verdict. The plaintiff appealed to the Jefferson common pleas, and on the trial in that court, the plaintiff proved the acts complained of as a trespass. The defendant, in his defence, read in evidence the act of the legislature authorizing James Le Ray de Chaumont to make a turnpike road in the county of Jefferson, passed 31st March, 1815, and a certificate of the governor of the state, dated 11th January, 1819, stating that the inspectors appointed to view the road, had reported favorably to the due completion of the same, and authorising Mr. Le Ray to erect a gate and turnpike upon and across every ten miles of the road, and to receive the tolls authorised by the act. The defendant offered in evidence a map of the survey of the road, to which was attached the signatures of two of the commissioners appointed by the act, for the pulpóse of shewing the designation and route of the road, who certified that the same was an accurate map of the survey of the road; but it appearing that the map was made and filed subsequent to the trial before the justice, and that the commis* sioners were not together when they signed the same, its admission was objected to and rejected. The defendant then proved that the road was made and completed 14 years before the trial in the common pleas, that it was cut out 4 rods wide, and worked 2 rods wide, and was worked and completed over the lands now occupied by the plaintiff previous to such lands being occupied by any one or any clearing made thereon. The fences in question Were built 3 or 4 years after the completion of the road, and were placed 6 or 10 feet within the four rods cut for the road, just on the outside of the ditch, by means whereof a horseman was prevented from passing along between the ditch and fence, which, in certain seasons of the year, was desirable, as the road sometimes was deep and miry. The road in question is the principal travelled road from the Black River county to Canada, and the Mail passes upon it daily. The lease to Vincent Le Ray and a direction from him to the defendant to remove the fences were proved. The court charged the jury that the road in question had been travelled for 14 or 15 yeas; it was not a public highway, not having been used as such for twenty years, and not having been laid out as a highway and recorded according to the statute, and that it could not be regarded as a turnpike road, as it had not been shewn that the act authorising its construction had been com- • plied with, in reference to the designation of the route of the same, previous to the commencement of the suit, and shewing the precise bounds and bearings of the road; that if all the provisions of the act had been complied with, Mr Le Ray had no right to remove the fence merely because it encroached upon the road,, that his right to do so depended upon the present and urgent necessity of the case, and such necessity had not been shewn; that Mr. Le Ray had the right to prosecute a evil action for any injury to the road affecting the tolls, but as to the question before the court he had no greater fights than any other individual, and was not justified in removing the fences, and that the plaintiff was entitled to recover. The jury found a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for $25 damages. The defendant having excepted to the decisions and charge of the court, sued out a writ of error. S.

On June 8, 1901, tlie Rio Grande, Mexico and Pacific Railroad Company conveyed to one Thomas Boles, a tract of forty acres of land in the town of Deming, New Mexico, in exchange for twenty acres of townsite lands, in the disposal of which, under the townsite laws, Boles was agent for the settlers, in which conveyance the following trust clause was inserted: “In trust, however to so much of the above-described land and premises as is occupied at the date of the execution and delivery of this deed, by persons having the right# of possession thereto on said date to the extent of two lots, of the ordinary size in said town of Deming, and no more, and subject to the payment by said persons, so entitled to the possession of their just share of the expenses that have been incurred in procuring the title to the lands included within the said premises so patented to said Carrol Dobbins, as aforesaid.” The settlers and the railroad\\' company were involved in litigation for this land, and in 1892 the appellant Gill entered the railroad close and erected a two-wire fence around part of the lands, but did not reside thereon or make other improvements. In 1895, when the fence of appellant\\' had fallen into decay and in anticipation of the land becoming public lands, as a result of pending litigation, A. Wallis, W. C. Wallis, John Tyndall and Prank Proctor entered upon the land in controversy, erected houses and other permanent improvements, and were actually residing upon the lands when the conveyance to Boles was made. Appellees made application for title for two lots each upon which they were residing and offered to pay their proportion of the expenses, under the trust clause of this conveyance and Boles’ notice calling upon claimants to make application. Gill also made application for the entire block 72 upon which the defendants were residing. Boles refused to execute deeds to the appellees and conveyed the entire block 72 to Gill, who brought suit to eject the appellees. Held, that the trust clause in the conveyance to Boles operated in favor of the appellees actually occupying the lands at the time the conveyance to Boles was made, June 8, 1896, to the extent of two lots each in block 72, and that Boles held such lots impressed with such trust; that Gill received and held such two lots each in trust for the respective appellees, and that a decree directing said Gill to convey to each of the appellees the lands they were occupying to the extent of two lots each, upon payment to him of their respective shares of the expenses assessed to them hy said Boles for obtaining title to such lands, was a proper decree. 2. That under the facts proven in this case, the lands conveyed hy the railroad company to Boles, in so far as the same were occupied at the date of the deed, were to he disposed of in practicable conformity with the laws of the United States and of the Territory of New Mexico, relating to townsites.

Right is that which one person ought to have or receive from another, it being withheld from him, or not in his possession. Bouvier’s Law Dictionary; Black’s Law Dictionary.

Tbe testimony was taken before a referee, whose report, including numerous findings of fact and conclusions of law, was, by tbe court, approved and confirmed in all respects, and a decree in favor of tbe defendants awarding tbean affirmative relief upon tbe answer and cross-complaint filed by them, was rendered in tbe court below, from which an appeal was taken to this court. Tbe facts developed on tbe bearing, so far as it is deemed necessary to state them, are, that on tbe twentieth day of August, A. D. 1885, a patent was issued by the United States in favor of Carrol Dobbins for forty acres of land at that time situated in tbe county of Grant, now in tbe county of Luna, New Mexico, including tbe premises in controversy in this action, block 72 of Boles’ Addition to tbe town of Deming. In tbe same year, Dobbins and wife conveyed said forty acres of land to tbe Rio Grande, Mexico\\', and Pacific Railroad Company, in whom the title thereto remained until tbe eighth day of June, 1896, upon which date tbe railroad company conveyed (a portion of) said forty acres, which included block 72, to one Thomas Boles, a resident of tbe State of Arkansas, but charged with a trust in tbe following language: “In trust, however, to so\\' much of tbe above-described land and premises as is occupied at the date of the execution and delivery of this deed, by persons having the right of possession thereto, on said date to tbe extent of tym lots of ordinary size in said town of Deming, and no more, and subject to tbe payment by said persons so entitled to tbe possession of their just share of tbe expenses that have been incurred in procuring tbe title to tbe lands included within tbe said premises so patented to said Carrol Dobbins as aforesaid.” In tbe year 1892, tbe appellant, John W. Gill, en tered -upon and fenced a portion of Carroll Dobbin’s forty acres, the said fence including block 72. This fence consisting of two strands of wire stretched upon two by fours thirty-two feet apart. Thereafter this fence went into decay; but a small portion thereof remained erected during and after the year 1894. Said Gill exercised no further acts of domain over said piece of ground so fenced except upon two several occasions; in 1893, and 1894; he leased it to circuses for the sum of five dollars in 1893, and for eleven tickets at one dollar each in 1894. In the month of May, 1895, the defendant A. Wallis, entered upon and fenced with a four-wire fence all of said block 72; he erected a tent and commenced the erection •of an adobe house upon the portion of said block, which, since the survey thereof, has been known as lots eleven and twelve. This house was completed within a short time thereafter, and defendant, A. Wallis, resided continuously therein thereafter up to and after June 8,1896, and during all of this time he was in the actual occupancy and possession of said two lots. While Wallis was engaged in the erection of the house he also dug a well upon said two lots. At the time Wallis entered, the fence, which had been erected by the appellant Gill, was down, and for some time previous appellant Gill had failed to maintain this fence. In the fall of 1895, the defendant John Tyndall, entered upon a portion of said block, which, since the survey thereof, has been known as lots five and six, and built a three-room adobe house and occupied the same and was in actual possession and occupation of said lots up to and after the eighth day of June, 1896. The defendant, Frank Proctor, in the fall of 1895, entered upon and took possession of a portion of said block 72, which, since the survey has been kno wn as lots nine and ten, and began the erection of a house thereon, which was completed during the following Avin-ter, and thereafter Proctor Avas in actual occupation and possession of said lots until and after the eighth day of June, 1896. The defendant W. G. Wallis, in the fall of 1895, entered upon a portion of tbe same block, which, since the survey, has been known as lots one and two, and commenced the erection of á house thereon and had adobe and rock hauled upon said premises, and thereafter, was in continuous occupation and possession of said land until and after the eighth day of June, 1896. That Boles as such trustee, caused the premises conveyed to him by the railroad company to be surveyed and platted into blocks, lots, avenues, streets and alleys, and a map thereof filed in the office of the probate clerk of Grant county, July 13, 1896. That Boles by a deed dated the sixth day of August, 1896, reciting the provisions of the trust aforesaid, conveyed to John W. Gill lot one in block 72, and Boles and wife on the sixth day of December, 1896, conveyed by quitclaim deed to John W. Gill lots two, three and four of block 72, and in a similar quitclaim deed dated December 29, 1896, conveyed to John W. Gill lots five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three and twenty-four in block 72. That prior to the conveyance of Boles to said Gill, the defendants above-named each made application to said Boles, as trustee, for conveyances to them of the land of which they were in occupation and possession, on the eighth day of June, 1896, and Boles stated to each his proportion of the expenses of obtaining title. Thereafter each of the defendants made tender of the amount so assessed to him to said Boles, as trustee, but Boles refused to convey, and later conveyed to John W. Gill. That Gill prior to the conveyance to him by Boles, had notice of the terms of said contract, and also- had notice of the rights of the defendants in the lots occupied severally by them in block 72. Upon these and certain other facts the court below found that appellant Gill under the conveyance to him by Boles took the lands in the possession of the defendants charged with the trust in favor of the defendants according to their respective rights and interests under the trust clause of the conveyance to him, and that the defendants were •entitled to the execution of the trust and to conveyances from Gill for the lots respectively claimed by them and for title to which application had been made and decree was entered by which Gill was commanded at his own expense to forthwith convey to each of the said defendants the lots occupied by them at the time of the conveyance from Boles to Gill upon payment to1 him of their proportion of the expense of obtaining the title to the , land.',\n",

       "  'case_summary': 'SUPREME COURT. Frank Lobdell and others, infants by Francis Bickerstaff, their guardian, respondents agt. Ammon Lobdell, and others, appellants. In an action for the specific performance of an agreement to convey land, the rule is not as strict now as formerly, in reference to the proof of the exact agreement alleged in the complaint. If the allegations of the cause of action are not unproved in their entire scope and meaning; and the variance is not material • and no one has been misled; and especially if no question of variance was raised at the trial, the objection taken on appeal that the agreement as set forth in the complaint is widely different from that found by the referee, will be disregarded. In an action by heirs at law of an intestate son, claiming a specific performance of an oral agreement for the conveyance of land, against the devisees of the father, one of the defendants, a devisee, cannot be a witness on his own behalf to prove a conversation between the father and son, and in which the witness took part, respecting the agreement by the father to give the son a deed of the property, on the performance of certain conditions. And it is not material whether the witness took part in the conversation or not. The broad objection is that he proposed by his evidence of the confessions or declarations of the deceased father of the plaintiffs (the son) to defeat their title as the heirs at law, and to establish his own title, he being a defendant. If the case does not come literally within the words of the statute (Code, § 399), “ any transaction or communication had personally by such party with the deceased” father of the plaintiffs, it is within the intention of the statute. It is a rule in equity that a specific performance of an agreement will not be decreed unless the agreement is founded upon a sufficient consideration. The plaintiff must make a meritorious case. SéZd, in this case that assuming the facts as found by the referee, the case of the plaintiffs was meritorious, and they were entitled to the relief demanded: although there was much doubt whether the agreement as found by the referee was ever made. The case however was not destitute of equity. The evidence showed an intention on the part of the father to give the land to his son, when he (the father) should die ; and some of the evidence tended strongly to show that he had already given him the land. Argued at Erie General Term May, 1866. Before Geovee, B../., Daniels, Mabvin and Davis, Justices, cmd decided Erie General Term September, 1866. Appeal from judgment entered on the report and decision of a referee. The facts sufficiently appear in the opinion of the court. Geo. W. Cothran, for plaintiffs. I. The facts found by the referee are fully sustained by the evidence. The status of the parties as found was conceded: That in 1846, Pliny Lobdell was seized of a farm of 57 37-100 acres of wild land in town of Hamburg, was admitted. That pursuant to a verbal agreement between Pliny and Seymour, in 1846, Seymour entered into possession of the south fifteen acres of this farm. That Seymour, in conjunction with Pliny, built a log house thereon, and in 1847, moved with his family into it, and finished it off while living in it. That no part of it was cleared when Seymour moved on it. That Seymour cleared it all up but about three acres. And fenced it. ¡Reduced it to cultivation. ¡Raised crops on it. Sold the wood, and logs and bark, and had the avails. Built a framed bam. Dug a well. Planted fruit trees. Built a framed house and moved in it in 1852, and lived therein until his death. He and Pliny built line fence between the fifteen acres and rest of the farm. He continued in possession from 1846 to May, 1864, when he died. And paid the taxes thereon. All this was done with Pliny’s knowledge. He claimed the land as his own to Pliny himself. As well as to other members of Pliny’s family. And to his neighbors. He claimed that Pliny had promised him a deed of it. He told Pliny so. And also told his neighbors. It was always spoken of in Pliny’s family as Seymour’s lot. He frequently asked his father for a deed of it. Pliny declined giving it, saying his word was as good as a deed. Pliny told many of his neighbors that it was Seymour’s land—that he had set it off for him as Seymour had worked hard for him, and showed Oliver Pierce the line clear through between the two parts of the lot. That he intended to give him a deed of it. And after Seymour’s death, he said to Pierce that “ he meant to have deeded it to Seymour before he died, but did not.” Bach of these facts is either conceded, or proved distinctly—nearly every one of them by defendants witnesses. The only points seriously combatted by defendants’ counsel in submitting the case to the referee, were as to the nature of the verbal agreement and the character of Seymour’s possession under it. The single question of fact to be determined here is what was the agreement ? The nature of which will necessarily characterize Seymour’s possession. That the possession of Seymour and his acts in relation to the land were clearly in pursuance of and conformity to this agreement, within the rule, will scarcely be controverted. The referee’s finding is explicit. The testimony of Anna Lobdell, Seymour’s widow and plaintiff’s mother, fully sustains the referee, and would have warranted him in finding a contract of purchase and payment of consideration. Seymour desired to go west, and by reason of the offer of this land, he was detained from going. But independent of her testimony, the evidence of Haney Lobdell Plinv’s widow and Seymour’s mother—notwith standing the bitterness of her feelings towards Seymour’s family, taken in connection with the repeated declarations of Pliny Lobdell, that these fifteen acres were Seymour’s, and the persistent claims of ownership of the land made by Seymour to his father, to William Russel, as well as to his neighbors; his continued claims that Pliny had promised him a deed of it, and his oft repeated demand of his father for the deed, most clearly and decisively sustain the referee’s finding. No man possessed of a grain of sense would have so continuously and pertinaciously insisted that the land was his, that his father had promised him a deed of it, and follow it up with his requests for the deed, had there been no agreement that this land was Seymour’s. Then add the acts and declarations of Pliny, and there can be no doubt of it. A great variety of declarations of Seymour tending to show that he did not claim to own this land, were proved on the part of the defendants. By reference to the evidence, it will be seen that nearly all of these witnesses are relatives of the defendants, and some of them with impaired characters. But the question as to whom to believe and whom to disbelieve, was purely a matter for the referee, and his decisions in that respect will not be disturbed (Eschbaugh agt. Syracuse Distilling M. and B. Co. 27 How. Pr. R. 125). It is proper that I should here state that the finding of the referee, that subsequent to Seymour’s death, Pliny.ousted\\' Seymour’s family and took possession of this land, is a mistake. The plaintiffs have at all times been, and now are in possession of it. The finding is not of such a material fact as to vitiate his conclusions.\\' II. Part performance of a parol agreement for the conveyance of real property, will take the case out of the statute, and specific performance will be decreed. (Williston agt. Williston, 41 Barb. S. C. R. 635,643; McCray agt. McCray, 30 Barb. S. C. R. 633 ; Surcombe agt. Pinninger, 17 Eng. L. and Eq. R. 212; Traphagen agt. Traphagen, 40 Barb. S. C. R. 537; 2 Story’s Eq. Juris. § 761; Marphet agt. Jones, 1 Swanst. 181.) The agreement in this case was that if Seymour would go on to and clear up, cultivate and improve these fifteen acres, Pliny would convey the same to him by deed. This agreement was performed by Seymour, not only in part, but entirely. He expended not only his time, but his money in improving this land, with the knowledge of Pliny. There is no means by which his hens can be adequately indemnified, save by compelling a conveyance to be executed. Hot only would it be a hardship, but a fraud upon these children to permit these defendants to deprive them of this little patrimony left them by their father; and it is their all of this world’s goods. This case comes clearly within the rule laid down by Justice Story, “ that nothing is to be considered as a part performance, which does not put the party into a situation, which is a fraud upon him, unless the agreement is fully performed.” (2 Story’s Eq. Juris. § 761; Malins agt. Brown, 4 Comst. R. 403.) To permit the defendants to interpose the statute here as a defense, would be to make it a statute to protect frauds, instead of a statute to prevent them. III. There was a sufficient consideration to sustain this agreement. There was both a good consideration and a valuable one. The grantee was the grantor’s son, and the son whom the grantee has repeatedly informed his neighbors was the only one who remained home and worked for his father. Then Seymour proposed to go west and purchase a farm, and to induce him not to go, Pliny agreed that if he would remain, and go on to and clear up, cultivate and improve these fifteen acres, the land should be his, and he would convey it to him by deed. Seymour agreed to it and fully performed the agreement. > The whole farm was wild lands. To procure these fifteen acres to be cleared up and improved, would enhance the value of the remaining portion, vastly more than the value of the whole as wild lands. In securing this, as well as a place to board Ms laboring men in clearing up the other part of the farm, Pliny received a valuable consideration amply sufficient to sustain the agreement. Then there was the time and money expended by Seymour in improving the land. IV. The variance between the allegations in the complaint and the proof as to the quantity of land, is not a material variance (Code, §§ 169, 170, 171). There was no question as to tMs variance, raised at the trial. Had there been, it could have been corrected. It is not too late even now, if the court regards it of any importance (Harris agt. Knickerbacker, 5 Wend. 638). The defendants not having taken the objection at the trial, it is waived. (Pike agt. Evans, 15 J. R. 210; Shall agt. Lathrop,3 Hill, 237; Lawrence agt. Baker, 5 Wend. 301.) The cases of Harris agt. Knickerbocker (supra) and Phillips agt. Thompson (1 Johns. Ch. R. 131), were cases which arose under the former practice, when the rules relative to allowing amendments to pleadings, were more strict than under the Code. An examination of these cases show that. they were both sustained, although reversed on particular grounds, so as to enable the court below to proceed in the manner directed by the court of review. So to as to the counsel’s objection that Seymour did not take possession of fifteen acres—that there is not fifteen acres within the fence. As to this objection, the referee held that there was no proof how much land was included within the fence, but that the agreement related to fifteen, acres. This court ought not to interfere with the judgment on mere suggestion of counsel, unsupported by any evidence. It was the fault of the defendants that no proof was offered on tMs point—the plaintiffs being content to take the fifteen acres, even if the part fenced off contained more than that amount. V. There is no error in the rulings of the referee in excluding the testimony offered at folios 147 and 151. The plaintiffs are the heirs at law of Seymour Lobdell, deceased, and claim title to the locus in quo, as such heirs, immediately through Seymour. The witnesses offered are defendants, and defend as devisees of Pliny Lobdell, and as such claim the title to this land. Eo matter about the peculiar .phraseology of section 399 of the Code, its obvious meaning and intention are to prevent a party to an action, who claims title to the subject matter of the action, from testifying in his own behalf as against heirs at law, to any matter or thing which he learned, or acquired personally from their ancestor. The section was intended to embrace, not only what the ancestor said personally to the witness, but what he said in the witnesses’ presence—to close the mouth of a living party to all verbal information he may have acquired, in any manner, from the ancestor of the plaintiffs; to withhold from the living party the opportunity, as against the representatives of the deceased, to testify to that which, if the dead could arise and speak, they might controvert; to that which no living tongue can speak, save that of the living interested party. Such was the view the learned referee took of the section; and I submit that he was correct. The sole question of construction in Simmons agt. Bisson (26 N. Y. 264), was whether, under the Code prior to the amendment of 1862, a “conversation” was a “transaction.” The court held it was not. The case was tried before the amendment of 1862, and what Judge Bosekbans says in relation to the amended section has not the force of an adjudication which this court is bound to follow. VI. Should the court be of the opinion that the evidence offered to be given by George Lobdell, as to the conversation heard by him was competent, it does not necessarily follow that a new trial must be granted. The only point litigated was “ about the terms upon which Seymour entered upon the land in question.” The defendants had already examined twelve witnesses on this point,. and subsequently called three more, who, with George Lobdell, who testified generally, except as to this conversation, made sixteen witnesses. The plaintiffs called but nine in all. The rejected testimony was merely cumulative, and could, by no possibility have changed the result, especially as the referee decided the case in favor of the plaintiffs mainly on the testimony of ¡Nancy Lobdell, the defendants’ witness. The well settled rule in\\' courts of equity is that a new trial will not be granted on account of the reception of improper or the rejection of competent evidence\\', where it is plain to be seen that the result would have been the same had the improper evidence been rejected, or the competent evidence received. When the result is satisfactory, courts of equity never reverse judgments on account of technical objections. (1 Barb. Ch. Prac. 459; Baker agt. Ray, 2 Russel Ch. R. 63, 66, 76-7; Bootle agt. Blundell, 19 Ves. Ch. R. 503.) Simmons agt. Sission (supra), was an action at law where technical rules are enforced. It is confidently submitted that this is a proper case for the enforcement of the equity rule. H. Boies and P. Gr. Parker, for defendants. The complaint alleges that Pliny Lobdell, for a good and valuable consideration, paid by Seymour Lobdell, sold and by parol conveyed to said Seymour, certain premises particularly described therein containing about fourteen acres. That he delivered to Seymour the possession thereof, and agrees to execute to him a deed at any time on request. The answer denies the agreements charged. The referee finds that Pliny being the owner of a wild lot, “ made a verbal agreement with Seymour that if he, Seymour, would take possession of, clear up, reduce to cultivation and make improvements upon a part of said piece of wild land to be taken off the southerly end thereof, the said fifteen acres should become and be the property of him, the said Seymour, and that he, the said Pliny, would convey the same to him by a sufficient deed of conveyance for that purpose.” These agreements are widely different. The one declared on is a sale. The one proved an agreement to give the land if Seymour clears it up. One is a sale of fourteen acres of land described by metes and bounds. The other an agreement to give fifteen acres. The one an agreement to execute a deed upon request. The other an agreement to execute it if Seymour would clear up and improve the land. To entitle the plaintiffs to recover, they must prove the identical agreement set out in the complaint. (Phillips agt. Thompson, 1 Johns. Ch. 131; Harris agt Knickerbacker, 5 Wend. 638-646; Wilde agt. Fox, 1 Rand. 165-170; Byrne agt. Romaine, 2 Edw. 445.) In Phillips agt. Thompson, the rule is stated as follows : “ To entitle the party to take the case out of the statute on the ground of part performance of the contract, he must make out by clear and satisfactory proof the existence of the contract as laid in his bill and the act of part performance must be of the identical contract set up by him. It is not enough that the act is evidence of some agreement, but it must be unequivocal and satisfactory evidence of the particular agreement charged in the bill.” In Harris agt. Knickerbacker, decided in the court of errors, the decree of the chancellor was reversed because the plaintiff had declared on a contract where the purchase money was payable in instalments, with interest, and proved a contract by which the purchase money did not draw interest. II. To entitle the plaintiffs to a judgment under the agreement found by the referee, they must prove that Seymour performed, the conditions upon which he was to have the land. He certainly could not be entitled to land that he never possessed, and yet a part of the land which the judgment directs these defendants to convey he never did possess. III. Can such an agreement as is found by the referee, be enforced by a court of equity, especially where the defendants offer to show that the plaintiffs suffer no peon yiary loss by reason of the non-performance of the agreement? In 4 Kent\\'s Commentaries, 451, it is said: “ The ground of this interference of chancery is fraud in resisting the completion of an agreement partly performed,- and which part performance would work a fraud upon the party unless the agreement was carried into complete execution.” In Harris agt. Knickerbocker (5 Wend. 656), Senator Oliver in delivering the opinion of the court says: “ The specific execution of parol agreements is decreed in chancery for the purpose of preventing fraud, * * * the plaintiff should prove what the contract was in fact, and the extent of its execution, and what the injury and fraud consists in.” In Phillips agt. Thompson (1 Johns. Ch. 131), the chancellor says: “ I agree with the wise and learned judges who have declared that the courts ought to take a stand against any encroachment upon the statute, and not to go one step beyond the rule and precedents already established.” I know of no reported case in which it is held that an agreeement to give away real estate can be enforced by a court of equity,\\' or that any other agreement to convey can be enforced unless a violation of that agreement would impose a pecuniary loss upon the party asking its performance. IV. Another rule requires that an agreement!» be enforced must be certain in its terms and mutual in its character (Germon agt. Machin, 6 Paige, 288). In this case a promise to convey premises to a son in consideration of his supporting the parent, there being no agreement on his part to support the parent, it was held could not be enforced. V. The referee erred in excluding the evidence of Ammon and George E. Lobdell, as to the arrangement under which Seymour took possession of the land in question. The exceptions in section 399 of the Code, as amended in 1865, so far as they relate to this case, must read as follows: Provided however, that * * * a party to an action (shall not) be examined in his own behalf in respect to any transaction or communication had personally by said * * party with a deceased person, against parties who are the heirs at law of such deceased person, where they have acquired title to the cause of action immediately from said deceased person, or (against parties) who have been sued as such * * * heirs at law. This provision, as I understand it, excludes the defendants from the right to testify to any transaction had personally with Seymour Lobdell and the plaintiffs from the right to testify to any transaction had between them and Pliny Lobdell, but it does not exclude either party from the right to testify as to transactions between Seymour and Pliny, There is no stronger reason for rejecting the evidence of the defendants in this case than there is for excluding the evidence of all parties as to every transaction not within the personal knowledge of them adversaries. Such a construction is not in accordance with either the spirit or the letter of the statute. \"VI. Is it just that these defendants should be made to pay the costs of this trial ? It seems to me, inasmuch as they have been able to defend successfully against the only claim of right which the plaintiffs ever made to them, and are beaten upon an agreement they never heard of until it appeared in the evidence upon the trial and the\\'findings of the referee, that it is a little hard to compel them to pay the costs of this trial.',\n",

One who enters on land, intending to take possession of the entire tract, no part of which is held adversely at the time of the entry, is in possession to the extent of his claim. An entry upon land, with the intention of clearing and fitting it for cultivation, is such an entry as that the jury may be authorized to infer actual possession from it. \\' Where in action of forcible entry and detainer, the plaintiff, for the purpose of establishing actual possession of the premises, proved that in the spring of 1854, he had the premises, which were uninclosed, surveyed, and a map made; that at the same time, stakes were set at the corners, and the trees blazed on the boundary lines; that a portion of the ground was also subdivided and laid off into smaller lots; that stakes were set up at the corners of respective lots, rendering the boundaries visible, in the usual way of laying out town lots; that a street was also made through the adjoining land of the plaintiff, which was graded so as to extend some five or seven feet on the premises in dispute; that the trees and under brush growing on the premises where the street was opened, were cut off and hauled away by the plaintiff ; that the plaintiff claimed to own some of the adjoining lots; and that he had sold lots adjoining the premises in dispute, to different persons;\\' and where the court instructed the jury, that actual possession of real estate may be shown by any act of possession, as where the owner goes upon the land to take possession, or to exercise any other act of ownership; and if they believed that the plaintiff exercised over the premises those acts of ownership usually exercised by owners over land on which they do not actually reside, they might infer actual possession; and that it was not necessary to such actual possession, that the premises should be surrounded by a fence, or built upon; and where the jury found that the plaintiff was in the actual possession of the premises, which verdict the court refused to set aside on -motion; Eeld, That the instruction was correct, and that there was sufficient evidence to justify the jury in finding that the plaintiff had actual possession of the premises at the time of the entry by the defendants. Where certain instructions in writing were asked by the defendants, and the court, when the jury was about to retire, handed them to the jury without reading, with the information that they were given as asked, all of which was done without objection; and where the defendant moved to set aside the verdict, for the reason among others, that the court did not give the defendant’s instructions, nor read them to the jury, which motion was overruled: Held, That the objection to the manner of giving the instructions, was too late after verdict, and that in the absence of objection, it must be presumed to have been done by consent. Either party is entitled to have the instructions read to the jury before they retire, and such is the better practice; but if neither party require it to be done, and suffer them to he handed to the jury, supposing that they would be read by the jury, it is too late after the verdict is rendered, to assign the same for error, or make the failure to read the instructions to the jury, the ground of a motion to set aside the verdict, and grant a new trial. The conduct and behavior of the jury before they retire to consider of their verdict, being in the presence of .the court, is presumed to be under its control, and subject to its reprehension or punishment, if in violation of good order, or wanting in due respect to the court, or its counsel. To justify the court in setting aside a verdict, on the ground of the misbehavior of the jury, whether before or after the cause is submitted to them, the alleged misconduct should clearly satisfy the mind of the court, that a fair and impartial trial has not been had, and that the verdict is contrary to the law and the evidence. \"Where in an action of forcible entry and detainer, the court instructed the jury as follows: “ 1. That if the jury believe that there were indications upon the ground in dispute, at the time defendants took possession, of its being controlled and actually possessed by some other person, it was sufficient to put defendants upon inquiry, and they had no right to take possession of the land while it seemed to be in the possession of another person. 3. If the jury believe that defendants took possession secretly, and in such way as to avoid observation, they are authorized to believe that defendants meant to acquire anqundue advantage, by which they ought not to be benefited. 8. That if the jury believe that defendants procured a surveyor to run out said lots, under an injunction of secrecy; that they on the same day followed close on the hoels of the surveyor, with loads of boards and posts; that they commenced the construction of a hasty unsubstantial fence, on the side most out of view from the city; that they built and finished such fence in the utmost haste; that they put up in the same manner, a shanty of boards upon the lot, out of sight among the trees; that these improvements were made with the utmost secrecy and expedition, the jury are authorized hence to infer that the entry of defendants upon said premises, was by fraud and stealth.” Held, That the instructions were legal and proper.

Wlien buildings are conveyed, and are described as standing on a lot of land, it usually becomes apparent, that it was not the intention to convey the land. In such case the superstructure only passes. When it is apparent, that the language, stating that they are standing upon a certain lot, is used only to describe the place where they are situated, in like manner and with like effect as if the deed had stated them to be standing on a particular square or street, no inference can be justly drawn, that it was not the intention, that the land on which they stand, but not the lot named, should pass by the conveyance. By a devise or grant of a messuage or house, the land on which it stands will pass with it, unless there be something to indicate that such was not the intention. But where the facts and circumstances in the case, clearly indicate, that the intention of the parties was that the land should not pass, the house only is conveyed. If the buildings only, and not the land on which they stand, are conveyed by the deed, the covenant therein, that the grantor will not claim “ any right or title to the aforesaid premises,” applies only to the buildings, and can have no influence upon any title to the land subsequently acquired by the grantor.

The deed from Jones, the tenant, to Dwinel & al. under which the demandant derives his claim of title, was in these words: — “ Knew all men by these presents, that I, Amasia Jones of Orono, in the county of Penobscot, in consideration of two hundred dollars to me paid by Luther Dwinel, Calvin Dwinel and Rufus Dwinel of Bangor, the receipt whereof I do hereby acknowledge, have remised, released, sold and forever quit claimed, and do for me and my heirs by these presents remise, release, sell and forever quit claim unto the said Dwinels, their heirs and assigns, the house and stable on the mill lot, at Great Works, built and now occupied by me. “ To have and to hold the aforementioned premises with all the privileges and appurtenances thereunto belonging, to them, the said Dwinels, heirs and assigns forever; so that neither I, the said Jones, nor my heirs or any other person or persons claiming from or under me or them, or in the name right or stead of me or them, shall or will by any way or means, have, claim or demand any right or title to the aforesaid premises or their appurtenances or any part or parcel thereof forever. “ In witness whereof I, the said Amasia Jones, have hereunto set my hand and seal this 29th day of March, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and thirty-three. “ Amasia Jones, [n. s.]” “ Signed, sealed and delivered in presence of Joel D. Thompson.” This case was continued the preceding year to be argued in writing, and the opening argument was prepared by Washburn, for the demandant. This argument did not come into the hands of the Reporter. Cutting argued for the tenant, contending in the first place, that nothing passed by the deed, but the house and stable, as personal property, and not the land on which they stood. Several circumstances were adverted to, tending to show that no land was expected to be conveyed. The consideration named was merely the value of the buildings to be carried off the land whereon they stood ; there is no description of any land in the deed, but the description is “ the house and stable on the mill lot,” excluding all supposition of a conveyance of the land; it was a mere quit claim deed; and no part of the land was then owned by Jones, the grantor, but in part by the grantees. 8 Conn. R. 374. There is no estoppel in consequence of that deed. It has no covenants whatever, and could create no estoppel, had it been a conveyance of land. But it conveys none. Even if the land which Jones afterwards purchased has become the land of the demandant by way of estoppel, but two thirds in common can be held by him, and he can main tain no action against bis co-tenant, without any ouster, or any thing equivalent. Colburn v.- Mason, 25 Maine R. 434. Washburn, in reply, said, that the description of the land was definite in the deed, “ the house and stable built and now occupied by me,” “on the mill lot at Great Works,” was merely further description. There is no disagreement between the English decisions and our own on this subject. This, like that in Fairbanks v. Williamson, cited in the opening argument, (7 Greenl. 96.) is a deed with covenants of special warranty. They are in this respect substantially alike.',\n",

Evidence held to sustain a finding that plaintiff’s live stock were drowned in his pasture by an overflow because of the negligent failure of the railway company to construct necessary openings through its fenced right of way and across its track. 2. —Same—Unprecedented Flood. Where it appeared that plaintiff’s stock would have been drowned in an ordinary overflow, it did not affect defendant’s liability that the flood was of an unprecedented character. 3. —Same—Contributory Negligence. Evidence held not to show plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence in failing to save his stock by cutting the fence after the raise of the water. 4. —Same—Evidence—“Cattle”—Habit—Common Knowledge. Where the witnesses testified that it was the habit of cattle, in cases of overflow, to go to the hills and high grounds (cut off by defendant’s fence), the word “cattle” is to be ccmstrued in its broadest sense and as including horses and mules, and the habit of these animals in this respect may also be regarded as matter of common knowledge, not requiring proof: 5. —Same—Contributory Negligence. Plaintiff was not chargeable with contributory negligence because he con-, tinued using the pasture after he knew of the construction of defendant’s fence there without sufficient openings. 6. —Same—Crossings—Stipulation in Deed. Under a stipulation in a deed of a right of way executed by plaintiff to defendant, that defendant should “construct all necessary crossings in its line over my. land,” plaintiff was entitled to show what character of crossings and how many were necessary for the proper use of his premises. 7. —Same—Open Crossing—Public Policy. A contract stipulation for an open private crossing over a railway track is not void as against public policy. Following Railway v.

A testator after directing his real estate to be sold and his securities to be collected, directed that from §3000 to §5000 should be expended for the improvement of burial lots belonging to him in a cemetery, in building a wall around his lots, and in procuring a monument; he gave $50,000 to erect a college, procure a library, &c., and §6000 additional to purchase books, &c.: he then directed “ after my real estate is sold and conveyed, the several bequeathments by me made from my estate paid, that there be a proportionate amount expended in the further improvement of the cemetery lots before mentioned ; and also a proportionate amount expended in the college or university buildings, library, &c.” Held, that the proportions were to be as fifty, six and five, calculated on the bequests to cemetery, library and college. 2.

Before Asnew, C. J., Sharswood and Mercur, JJ. Appeal from the Orphans’ Court of Allegheny county: No. 200, to October and November Term 1874. In the estate of John M. Porter, deceased. The decedent died in December 1865, on or before the 4th of that month,having made a will, dated November 30th 1865, and seised and possessed of a large real and personal estate. He directed a large portion of his land designated to be divided into ten lots and sold by his executors. He directed other lands, also designated, to be divided into sixteen lots and sold also; a farm on other lands also to be sold, allowing William \\'Irwin the tenant to remain on it three years, he paying the rent, &c. “ I also direct the farm purchased of J. P. Yantine, now occupied by E. Burchfield, to be sold by my executors, * * * and the proceeds of the sale to be given and applied to the academy or college hereinafter mentioned, to be expended in the extension of the library or improvements to the buildings, as the trustees may deem best. I also direct that the farm adjoining said Burchfield and occupied by Hezekiah Irwin shall be sold in like manner as the farm occupied by his father as before directed. Also, I direct that the Martin farm he sold as above stated in respect of the Yantine farm, and the proceeds applied as therein directed. And it is my wish that the said Hezekiah Irwin and E. Burchfield be permitted to stay in the places for three years after my death, upon their regularly paying their rents. * * *. My interest in the - Horse Creek and Tarentum Oil Company I direct to be sold to the best advantage. * * * “ The notes, mortgages, judgments and accounts which I hold against sundry and divers persons, I desire and direct to be collected. * * * I also direct that my interest in the Himelwright property be sold by my executors, * * * and the proceeds to be applied as hereinafter directed. I also direct that the Walnut Bend property in Cornplanter township, Yenango county, be sold and the proceeds be applied as hereinafter directed. Also, I direct that all my interest on Hickory be sold. Also, my interest in the Widow McClintock farm; also my interest in the Fleming farm, being my interest in about nine and a half acres. Also, I direct that my interest in one thousand acres of land in Lewis county, Kentucky, bought from a man by the name of Hallert, be sold. * * * Also, I direct that my interest in the Porter, Donnel & Co. property in Ohio, be sold, both real and personal. * * * I now give to Nancy Jane Porter McCall, my adopted sister, the house and lot I now live in, also the lot which I bought from John Adams, * * * for and during her natural life, together with all the personal property in and about my said dwelling, which shall not be by me otherwise disposed of. Also, I bequeath to my said adopted sister, N. J. P. McCall, twelve thousand dollars in seven-ten United States bonds. “ I also direct that from three to five thousand dollars be ex pended in the improvement of the burial lots belonging to me in the Prospect Cemetery, in building a cut-stone wall around the lower end of said lots, and in procuring -a suitable monument, and to have inscribed on said monument the date of the birth and death of my father, mother, brothers and sisters, and also of my own birth and death ; and at the death of my adopted sister, N. J\". P. McCall, to have her name lettered in the same manner, as the adopted daughter of R. -S. Porter and Nancy Jane Porter, I also give and bequeath the sum of fifty thousand dollars, to be expended in the purchase of a lot or lots, and the erection of a college or university, with library rooms, &c., to be located in ornear Tarentum, together with my library, and six thousand dollars additional to be expended in the purchase of useful books for the library ; and it is my wish that the said college or university be known as the Porter University or College. And I do hereby appoint Rev. Joseph Horner, &e., trustees to purchase said lot or lots, and for the erection of the buildings, procuring a charter and library, with the general management of the whole concern, with power, if necessary, to add to their number and devise suitable ways for the election or appointment of their successors. * * * “ It is my wish and intention, and I also direct, that after my real estate is sold and conveyed, the several bequeathments by me made from my estate paid, that there be a proportionate amount expended in the further improvement of the cemetery lots before mentioned; and also a proportionate amount expended in the college or university buildings, library, &c. <£ Also, I direct that after the death of the said N. J. P. McCall, that the house and lots bequeathed to her for and during her natural life, be sold and conveyed by my executors, proceeds of such sale be applied to the benefit of the said college or university, including the library in and for the use of said university.” * * * There were other bequests in the will which it is not necessary to particularize. At the instance of the heirs and next of kin of the decedent the gift for the college, library, &c., was declared void as being a gift for a charitable use, and therefore within, the prohibition of the Act of April 26th 1855, sect. 11, Pamph. L. 831,1 Br. Purd. 208, pi. 23, the will having been made within a month of the testator’s death. The executors settled three accounts; the third being that involved in this controversy. In this account the executors took credit for “ amount retained on account of cemetery under will of testator, being the proportion set apart for the same, — $6500.” The balance for distribution appearing on the account was $27,451.57. Exceptions were filed to the account, one of which was that the accountants should not be allowed a credit for $6500 retained on account of the cemetery. William Blakely was appointed auditor to pass upon the exceptions and report distribution. On the hearing before him the marble-mason testified that he did the stone work for the fence of the cemetery lot- under contract for $4200, and lost money by the job, and that a monument corresponding with the fence should cost not less than $5000. The auditor found that the whole sum which jvas to be appropriated to the bequest to college, &c., was $61,643.42; he also found that in a former account the executors were allowed a credit of $5000, and that that was all the cemetery was entitled to receive until the other bequests should be paid. The auditor sustained two of the exceptions, one of which was to the allowance of the sum of $6500, retained on account of cemetery; and he thus increased the balance against the executors to $36,197.54. He reported also that the bequests to the charity —now payable to the next of kin — should be first paid to them before the “ proportionate amount ” of the residue should be distributed ; that the next of kin were entitled to $31,043.33 out of the present account, in addition to what they had theretofore received ; which would leave $3,236.62 to be divided between the next of kin and the cemetery in “proportionate amounts,” as $61,643.42, the total amount of bequests to the college, is to $5000, the total amount of bequest to “Prospect Cemetery,’.’ giving to the heirs the additional sum of $2993.79 and to Prospect Cemetery the sum of $242.83. The executors filed exceptions to the report, covering the surcharges made by the auditor against them. The court sustained one of the exceptions but overruled that to the disallowance by the auditor of the credit of $6500 for the cemetery lot. In delivering their opinion the Orphans’ Court said: * * * “We are of opinion that the auditor was correct in surcharging the account with the $6500 for which the executors claimed credit; but in sustaining the auditor’s report in this respect, we do not decide that the contemplated improvement of the cemetery lot, including the erection of monument, &c., should not he carried out. It appears that a considerable portion of the estate remains unsettled and will be brought into the next account for distribution; and it is probable that the proportionate share of that fund to which the executor will be entitled for the further improvement of the cemetery lot, will be sufficient for that purpose. If it is not, it is to be hoped that the heirs at law will not be so far lost to every sense of propriety as to object to the appropriation of a sufficient sum to mark, in a suitable manner, the resting place of their relative and benefactor. The beneficient design of the tes tator, as expressed in his will, was defeated, on the ground that his will was not executed as long before his decease as the statute requires. This of course has enured to the benefit of the heirs at law, some of whom appear to be unwilling to see a reasonable amount expended in the erection of a monument. Such a course reflects but little credit on such of them as pursue it. A monument suitable to the estate and condition of the testator should be erected, and if the “ proportionate amount ” mentioned in the will should prove inadequate, a sum sufficient to supply the deficiency should be appropriated out of the general funds of the estate. After surcharging the account with the $6500, we have the sum of- $33,951.57 as the balance for distribution.” * * * After stating some other items to be considered in ascertaining the amount for distribution the court proceeded : “Deducting this from the amount found by the auditor, as above stated, we have the sum of $22,952.16 yet to be received by the distributees before the ‘ proportionate amount’ of the residue is given for the further improvement of the cemetery, &c. This last sum, deducted from the net balance for distribution, as above, leaves the sum of $9072.82, of which a proportionate amount, as directed by the will, shopld be appropriated for the further improvement of the cemetery lot. In endeavoring to determine what is meant by ‘ a proportionate share,’ we find that in the clauses of the will, immediately preceding the one in which this expression is used, the testator gives $5000 to be expended in the improvement of this burial lots, &c., and — including his private library— the sum of $56,203.42, to be expended in college or university buildings, library, &c. We are of opinion that it is to these sums respectively that the testator refers when he speaks of ‘ a proportionate amount.’ It is true that he makes other provisions for the college, such as directing the proceeds of the property devised to his adopted sister for life to be applied after her death to the further improvement of the college or university buildings and library, also the proceeds of the Vantine farm, &c. ; but none of these were to be so applied immediately after the death of the testator. The Vantine farm was not to be sold for three years, and the property devised to his adopted sister not until after her decease. We have concluded that in speaking of ‘ a proportionate amount’ the testator had reference to the sums already named in the immediately preceding clauses of the will. If we are correct in this? the proportion of the one would be 8.17 per cent, and the other 91.83 per cent., or $741.24, to the executors for the further improvement of the cemetery, and $8331.54 to the distributees, in addition to the $22,952.16 above mentioned.” * * * The court accordingly decreed distribution on this basis. • The executors appealed to the Supreme Court and assigned for error, amongst others, that the court had surcharged them with the $6500.

A division fence extended into tide-water by a riparian proprietor, on a certain line, prima facie indicates a claim of title to the land under water on his side of the line as far out as the fence is built. When a boundary between riparian proprietors of business property upon tide-water depends upon conveyances, the legal effect of which is uncertain, the acquiescence of one in a line claimed by the other is presumptive evidence that such line is the true one. Nor is it of any consequence that the parties acted under a misapprehension of their legal rights. But a boundary line which rests largely on acquiescence and consequent estoppel, ought mot to be extended further than such acquiescence clearly requires. In determining the division line between riparian proprietors on an irregular shore, the law aims to give each, so far as may be, a fair and reasonable opportunity of access to the channel. In case of a concave shore a straight line should be drawn across the mouth of the bend or cove, from which a perpendicular line should run to the point of division at high-water mark, or to the offshore terminus of the division line, if it has been deflected and extended toward the channel by the acts of the adjoining owners. Equitable defenses may be made, on an appeal from a justice of the peace, although they might not have been available before him. [Argued January 20th decided March 3d, 1897.] Action for an entry on tide-water flats and a trespass by cutting off the plaintiff’s piles, brought by appeal from the judgment of a justice of the peace to the Court of Common Pleas for Fairfield County, and tried to the court, Curtis, J.; facts found and judgment rendered for the defendants, and appeal by the plaintiff for alleged errors in the rulings of the court. Error in part. The following facts appeared from the finding: The plaintiff owned a wharf-lot on the easterly side of Five Mile river at Rowayton in Norwalk, west of Main street, and the defendants owned the next lot, on the south. The controversy between them was as to the limits of the riparian privileges attaching to each lot, below high-water mark. The upland division line corresponded to an extension easterly to high- water mark of the southerly line of a street called Crockett avenue, which ran into Main street, nearly at right angles, and went no further. Said upland division line was about twenty feet long. Both lots belonged, in 1867, to Robert Godfrey. In that year he conveyed to Henry M. Hoyt and Peter Decker, the predecessors in title of the plaintiff, a parcel of land described as bounded northerly by land of one Cudlipp, easterly by land of one Knowlton, “southerly by a driftway, and westerly by a highway; with the water privilege connected therewith, said tract containing one acre, more or less.” Main street was the highway here referred to. In 1868, he conveyed to William Godfrey, the defendants’ predecessor in title, a parcel of land at Five Mile river described as bounded “northerly by a driftway and land of John Crockett and William G. Crockett, easterly and southerly by land of Charles L. Raymond, and westerly by highway. Also a certain wharf-lot, situated at said Five Mile river, bounded northerly by Henry M. Hoyt and Peter Decker, easterly by highway, southerly by laud of Charles L. Raymond, and westerly by Five Mile river, so-called.” Main street was the highway here referred to. William Godfrey conveyed this wharf-lot, by a similar description, in 1875, to Oliver Cook, and in 1876 Cook conveyed to Charles W. Raymond, the plaintiff’s predecessor in title, by a quitclaim deed, half an acre of land, more or less, bounded northerly and westerly by Five Mile river harbor, southerly by the grantor’s other land, and easterly by Main street. This southerly boundary on Cook’s upland was understood and intended by him to be the southerly line of Crockett avenue extended, and thereafter he occupied to that line as his northerly upland boundary. In 1875 he had built a fence from Main street in said line to a point about a board’s length below high-water line, and subsequently occupied only up to said fence. This fence continued until 1889 or later, some of the posts remaining in 1891. Raymond, a few days after his deed from Cook, conveyed the land by a similar description to John H. Lowndes, and by the added description, “ the same being directly in front of said Lowndes’ land.” In 1889 Oliver Cook conveyed to one Thornes, land on the east side of Main street, south of Crockett avenue, “ also that certain wharf-lot situated in front of and separated from the above described tract by the highway, bounded northerly by a driftway, easterly by the highway, southerly by land of Charles W. Bell, and westerly by the harbor of Five Mile river, said above described premises being known as the Godfrey property.” Thornes conveyed to the defendants and one Julia L. Crockett, in October, 1891, a wharf-lot “ bounded and described as follows: On the north by common land which is a continuation of Crockett avenue (so-called) to Five Mile river harbor; on the east by the highway; on the south by land of Sands Selleck, formerly belonging to said grantor; on the west by Five Mile river harbor. The south boundary of said described lot begins at a point by the highway eighty (80) feet north of the dock of said grantor, running westerly to the river.” Thornes had never occupied north of the fence erected by Cook, and pointed it out to the grantees, preliminary to his conveyance to them, as the northerly boundary of the wharf-lot which he was to convey. In December, 1891, the defendants, with the assistance of a surveyor, attempted to find their offshore line, and ranged across the flats along the line of said upland boundary line extended, and had the line so found represented on a map, and they then thought that their offshore line was thus to be found. Heither the plaintiff nor his grantor was aware of these acts. In February, 1892, John H. Lowndes drove a pile about thirty-five feet below high-water mark, in the line of said upland dividing line extended, and from that pile drove a straight row of fourteen piles tending a little to the north of said division line extended. Said row of piles was one hundred and fifty feet in length. At the time said piles were driven the defendants knew of the same, but made no objection thereto. In 1891 the defendants carted stone upon their wharf-lot for the purpose of building a dock. In December, 1898, they began to build a stone dock-wall on the flats in front of their wharf-lot, building northerly from their southerly line and reaching the present line of piles, at a point sixty-seven feet below high-water line, after this suit was begun. No stone were laid north of the row of piles. After said John H. Lowndes drove said row of piles, he floated other piles along the northerly side of the same and fastened them to the driven piles. These piles were collected for the purpose of building a dock there. Some years before this, John H. Lowndes had built a dock thirty-five feet north of the said upland division line, in such a direction as to have crossed Crockett avenue, extended, if built out far enough. In August, 1892, the defendants and said Crockett conveyed to Sands Selleck a wharf-lot “ bounded and described as follows: On the north by common land, which is a continuation of Crockett avenue (so-called), to Five Mile river harbor. On the east by the highway. On the south by land of said grantee. On the west by Five Mile river harbor. The south boundary of said described lot begins at a point by the highway, eighty (80) feet north of the dock of Ephraim Thornes, running westerly to the river; being the same piece of land deeded to us by warranty deed from Ephraim Thornes, dated the first day of October, 1891.” In August, 1893, Selleck conveyed to the City National Bank of South Nor-walk a tract of land described as “ bounded easterly one hundred and twenty (120) feet by highway, southerly by land of E. Thornes, westerly by Fivé Mile river harbor, and northerly by land of John H. Lowndes.” In December, 1893, the bank conveyed to the defendants a tract of land described as “ all that land lying north of a line drawn from a point on highway, ninety-one (91) feet north of E. Thornes’ coal dock, to a point ninety-one (91) feet north of said coal dock on Five Mile river, being triangular in shape, and the point being spiles of John Lowndes, as now set; bounded easterly on highway sixty-seven (67) feet, more or less, southerly by other land of City National Bank, and westerly by land of John H. Lowndes.” On January 2d, 1894, the defendants conveyed to the bank a tract described as “ all that tract of land lying north of a line drawn from a point on the highway, ninety-one feet north of E. Thornes coal dock, to a point ninety-one feet north of said coal dock on Five Mile river, being triangular in shape, and the point being spiles of John Lowndes, as now set; bounded northerly by land of John H. Lowndes, easterly on the highway, sixty-seven feet, more or less, and southerly by land of the said grantee; ” and the bank immediately conveyed to them a tract of land described as “being seventy-two feet and eight inches in front on the highway, more or less, and bounded northerly by land of John H. Lowndes, easterly by the highway, southerly by other land of said grantor, and westerly by the Five Mile River harbor; said southerly boundary line being more particularly described as follows: Commencing at a point on the harbor line, where a pile is now driven, seventydive feet northerly from the northwest corner of dock belonging to Ephraim Thornes, thence extending in an easterly direction to a point on the highway eighty-five feet and six inches distant from said dock of Ephraim Thornes.” On January 6th, 1894, John H. Lowndes conveyed to the plaintiff a tract of land described as “bounded northerly by my other lands, easterly by highway, southerly by land now or late of the City National Bank, of South Norwalk, and westerly by the channel of the river or harbor line; said tract being 84-2 feet in width.” At this time the defendants were in possession of their wharf-lot as they had been ever since their deed of the preceding December. Immediately after January 6th, 1894, the plaintiff took up all the piles his grantor had driven, except those at each end of said row, and forthwith drove new piles along said line and extended said line of piles westerly about 40 feet, until the same met the dock of Charles Lowndes, and thus cut off the defendants’ upland from access to the harbor. Said Charles Lowndes’ dock was built some time between February, 1892, and January, 1894, along the defendants’ southerly line, but by what right or under what title did not appear. The Thornes dock was built before December, 1891. The plaintiff placed caps along the top of said row of piles. The defendants protested against the driving of said piles by the plaintiff, both along the old line and the extended line, claiming that by so doing he was “robbing them of their rights,” and cutting them off from access to the harbor. The plaintiff then refused to permit them to show him what they claimed, and was not influenced in any action he took after their protest by any claim made by them or any failure to make a claim. On January 29th, 1894, and again on February 1st, 1894, the defendants went upon said row of piles and cut the capping. Each of these acts was the subject of a separate count. Said cutting was a reasonable and suitable means of removing said capping. The same was injured on each occasion to the amount of $5. The plaintiff on the dates last aforesaid was so far in possession of the locus as the facts above stated indicate. The United States government has dug a channel and in January, 1892, it established a harbor line in said Five Mile River harbor. There was originally no deep channel in the river at low tide, but only a mere thread of water ten feet or so wide, in portions not navigable for skiffs. At extreme low tide it was fresh water, draining through. The channel so dug by the government includes this thread and corresponds with its direction. The present southerly line of Crockett avenue is a little south of, but parallel with, the original line. The general trend of the easterly shore line of Five Mile River harbor, taking a considerable distance into account and omitting to notice small indentations and projections, is parallel to the harbor line established by the government. A line drawn at right angles to said harbor line (and hence to the said trend of the shore) from the point of intersection of the defendants’ northerly boundary line on the upland and the high-water or shore line, runs to the north of said row of piles driven by the plaintiff. A line drawn from the point of intersection of the defendants’ northerly boundary line on the upland and the high-water line, perpendicular to the course of the channel as it tends southerly from in front of said Crockett avenue—said line not meeting said channel at right angles as the same actually exists, but meeting the said course of the same extended northerly—runs northerly of said line of piles driven by the plaintiff. If a perpendicular line be drawn across the flats from the line joining the corners of the plaintiff’s land on the shore, and also on the line joining the defendants’ land on the shore, from their point of intersection, and the space between those lines be equally divided between the parties, then said row of piles driven by the plaintiff will be upon the portion of the defendants’. The course of the channel follows substantially the old drain or channel of the harbor. The water frontage above and below the upland dividing line of said parties has been used by the parties, and by the people of that vicinity, as a landing place for boats and other general uses of watermen, until within a few years. Since said row of piles was driven in 1892, the frontage north of the same has not been so used. From the foregoing facts, it was further found that there had been no title gained by adverse possession for fifteen years, by either of said parties, or their predecessors in the chain of title, to the flats lying in front or in the immediate vicinity of their dividing line over the upland. None of the successive owners of the two tracts have agreed upon a dividing line across the flats from their upland boundary line, unless the facts herein set forth constitute an agreement. The plaintiff claimed, (1) that upon the foregoing facts he was in possession of the locus at the time of the trespass, and so was entitled to judgment on both counts, unless the defendants had proved paramount title; (2) that the defendants were confined in their proof of title to boundaries ascertained in one of the two ways specified in their second or third defense; (8) that upon the facts, the line of piles was not south of such a division line between the parties as the law would have established in the absence of an establishment by the parties themselves; (4) that upon the facts, the parties and their predecessors in title' had fixed the division line across the flats as the southerly line of Crockett avenue extended, and that the same should be adopted in this case; (5) that the deed of January 2d from the City National Bank to the defendants, could not convey to them any title north of the line of piles; (6) that the defendants were estopped by their own acts and the acts of their grantors to claim title north of that line; and (7) that the title of the defendants and their grantors, if it ever existed, had been lost by adverse possession. The second defense alleged that “the northerly and southerly boundary lines of the defendants’ said riparian lot, are lines drawn at right angles to the said harbor line to respectively the northerly and southerly extremities of the easterly boundary line.” The third defense alleged that “ the northerly and southerly boundary lines of defendants’ said wharfing-lot are at right angles to the general course or channel of the river, and run from the northerly and southerly extremities respectively of the easterly boundary line.” In each defense, the easterly boundary was described as being the highway known as Main street. These defenses were denied. The court found all the issues for the defendants, and ruled that the precise line of division, which the law recognized as existing since 1867-8 over the flats, between the lands of the parties, was a line at right angles to the general trend of the shore; that this line was north of the row of piles; that possession follows the title of unoccupied flats, and so the defendants and their predecessors in title were in possession up to said line until February, 1892, at least; that the plaintiff and his grantor, since February 1st, 1892, had held possession up to said line of division so far as to the end of the 1892 line of piles; that since February, 1892, no conveyance of the land north of the line of piles could be made by any other party, as it would be void under the statute, against conveying pretended titles (General Statutes, § 2966); that none of the successive owners of the two tracts had ever agreed upon a dividing line below high-water mark, unless the facts specially found constituted an agreement ; that the true division line on the flats was north of the 1892 line of piles, and the plaintiff, or his grantor, was in possession of the flats between the 1892 line of piles and the true line from August 1st, 1892, till January 2d, 1894, inclusive, while the title was in the defendants and Julia L. Crockett, as joint tenants; that in February, 1894, when the alleged trespasses were committed, the defendants owned the fee south of the 1892 line, and were joint tenants in the flats north of said line up to the true division line, thus having the rights of an owner of the fee; and so that they could not be regarded as trespassers.

Highways—Dedication—Evidence.—A County Highway Terminated at the western boundary of certain land, the terminal being marked by stone m-onuments sixty feet apart. The owner of the land employed a surveyor, who surveyed a strip sixty feet in width from the terminal of the highway to the eastern boundary of the land, and there placed a post at the northern and southern boundaries of the strip; and a map was made, showing the strip surveyed, with the eastern end closed, and filed for record in the county. At the time of the survey the owner of the land informed) the surveyor and his children that his purpose was that a map might be made of the road, in order that, in dividing his land among his children, reference might be made to the map, to insure certainty of description, and that the county could not have the strip as a highway unless it paid for it. He told the children to farm up to the center of the road, which they did. The strip surveyed was never recorded or platted as a county road, and no highway connected the strip on the east. Held, that there was no dedication of it for use as a highway. Nuisance—Fence in Highway.—Where in an Action Against a Grantee of the owner to abate a nuisance consisting of a fence erected by her on the strip, on the ground that the strip had been dedicated by her grantor as a highway, the defense was that there was no dedi nation, but that the survey and map were made merely that the map might be referred to in conveyances, to insure certainty of description, and the court found that the strip was not a highway, findings that the strip was not a continuation of the county road, and that it was not dedicated to the public by the owner, and not abandoned to the public, were not necessary. Nuisance—Fence in Highway.—In an Action Against a Grantee of the owner to abate a nuisance consisting of a fence erected by her on the strip, it was not error to exclude the field-notes and memorandum-books of the surveyor, where it appeared that they were never shown to defendant’s grantor and were not recorded, and the evidence showed that the map was made from the field'-notes, and it did not •appear that the notes, if admitted, would throw any additional light on the map, or the grantor’s intention in having it made, and the surveyor used the field-notes in testifying, and was not restrained from stating any facts relating to the survey found in them.

(p. 220.) ■ Woods, .Judge, furnishes the following statement of the case: This is a hill filed hy the Mason City Salt and Mining Company, a corporation existing and organized hy and under the laws of this State, against the town of Mason, an incorporated town in this State, to enjoin and restrain the said town from opening certain streets and alleys through the plaintiff’s lands without having first condemned the same to the public use. The material allegations of the plaintiff’s hill are, that it is the owner in fee simple of a certain tract of land in the county of Mason in this State lying adjacent to the corporate limits of the town of Mason, containing about two hundred and seventy-three acres; that it, and those under whom it claims title to said land have been in the open, notorious and continuous possession of said land ever since, and before the 15th of September, 1856, claiming the said land and exercising acts of ownership over it as the property of the said plaintiff and those under whom it claims; that the defendant wrongfully claims that certain portions of said land which it designates and describes as “ Wide alley, from Brown street to Anderson street, and alley D. from First street to Front street,” that said “Wide” alley is twenty feet wide, and alley “D.” is sixteen feet wide; that the said defendant pretends that said “alleys,” many years ago, wore, and that they had been dedicated to it by the then owner of said land for the public use of said town; that neither the said defendant nor any other person, officer or corporation at any time whatever in any manner whatever accepted said pretended dedication of said pretended alleys, nor did the said defendant either by its officers, agents or servants, do or cause to be doiie any work on said pretended alleys, nor did anj1, person or public authority do any work on said pretended alleys within the boundaries claimed by the defendant, and the said defendant refused to accept said pretended dedication of said “Wide” alley and alley that the plaintiff owns and is seized in fee simple of the lands abutting to said “alleys;” the defendant has no interest or right, title or estate of any sort whatever in the real estate designated by said streets and alleys; that the real estate over which said pretended streets and said “ Wide” alley and alley “D.” has b’een enclosed by a good and substantial fence built by those under whom the plaintiff claims its title to said laud for a period of more than ten years past, and that two dwelling houses were built by those under whom the plaintiff claims title, on that portion of said land which is designated “Wide” alley; that said parties under whom it claims title to said land, built another large house between said pretended streets; that these buildings are worth one thousand five hundred dollars and are now used and occupied by the plaintiff; that the plaintiff is the owner of a large salt furnace and bromine works next to and adjoining said pretended streets and alleys, and is manufacturing large quantities of salt and bromine at that place; that to carry on said works successfully, it is necessary for him to use said pretended “Wide” alley and alley “D;” that the defendant, through its officers, agents and attorneys, is threatening to tear down said fences enclosing said lands, and to tear down said buildings and remove the same, and in execution of said threat, the defendant through •its town council, street commissioner aud town sergeant, has commenced and destroyed a portion of said fence enclosing said land; that the defendant, through its council and officers, is threatening and attempting to take said “Wide” alley, alley “D” and a portion of a pretended street called Front street and convert and appropriate the same to the public use of said town without any legal condemnation of the same and without compensating or in any way paying plaintiff therefor; that said defendant through its town council aiid duly authorized agents is persisting in its threats to tear down all said fences, remove said buildings and take said pretended streets and alleys and convert the same to the use of the town of Mason for streets and alleys against, the consent of the plaintiff, to his irreparable injury, and thereupon prays that said defendant “the town of Mason,” its council, street superintendents, sergeants, officers, agents and servants be enjoined from entering upon the said premises designated as part of Front street and “Wide” alley and alley “D,” and from removing, tearing down or interfering with said fences, houses aud buildings and also from attempting to take said premises or any part-thereof and converting the same to the public use of said town of Mason as streets and alleys until they answer and show cause why the said defendant, its council, officers aud servants should not be perpetually restrained from doing so, aud for general relief. This bill was duly verified by Gr. Y. Roots, president of Mason City Salt and Mining Company, and presented to the judge of the circuit court of said county, who awarded an injunction thereon in these words: “ The defendant, the Town of Mason, its officers, agents and employes are restrained, inhibited and enjoined from entering upon the premises and real estate claimed by plaintiff, . and set out and described in the plaintiff’s bill and exhibits, aud from removing, tearing down or in any manner interfering with the fences, houses aud buildings upon said premises and from taking said premises, or any part thereof, for the public use, or otherwise interfering there with, without first obtaining condemnation thereof, as prescribed by law, until the further order of the court. But this injunction is not to take effect until the plaintiff, or some responsible person for it, shall give bond, with good security, before the clerk of the circuit court of Mason county, West Virginia, in the penalty of one hundred dollars, conditioned to pay all such costs as may be awarded against the plaintiff, and all such damages as may be incurred by any person by reason of said injunction in case the same shall hereafter be dissolved. “To the Clerk of the. Circuit Court of Mason County, West Virginia: “J. Smith, “ Judge of the 'Ith Jud. Dis. “June 23d, 1876.” This bill was filed, injunction made effective, and process executed on defendant, and decree nisi taken at July rules, 1876; and at August rules the bill was taken for confessed, and set for hearing by the plaintiff. At a circuit court held for said county on the 16th day of October, 1876, the defendant appeared by its attorney and demurred to the plaintiff’s bill, in which the plaintiff joined. No further action was taken in the cause until April 5, 1878 — when the defendant again appeared, and moved the court to dissolve the said injunction. On the 19th day of April, 1878, the court overruled the demurrer, and also the said motion to dissolve the injunction, and required the defendant to answer the plaintiff’s bill, by the first day of the next term of said court. The defendant made default and failed to file its answer at the next term of said court, and no proceedings were had until April 15, 1879, when the defendant filed its answer to the plaintiff’s bill, to which it replied generally; and the defendant again moved to dissolve said injunction, and the plaintiff moved to continue the cause. 'The answer on the day it was filed' was verified in the usual form, by the oath of the mayor of the defendant. The answer in substance alleges, the said streets and alleys were dedicated to the use of said town by one Payne on the 15th of September, 1856, and the paper-writing whereby the dedication was duly recorded in said county on the 16th of September, 1856, and that the deed under which the plaintiff claims title to one undivided moiety of said tract of land, although dated on the 1st of .February, 1856, was not delivered until the 4th of April, 1857, nor recorded until the 5th of January, 1858, and that therefore the said dedication was made while -Payne owned the fee to the whole tract; that it is not true that the plaintiff'is seized in fee simple of that portion of the lands covered by said streets and of “Wide” alley and alley “P;” that, it is not true that the plaintiff' and those under whom it claims title to said land, included in “Wide” alley and alley “D,” or of any of said streets, have been in continuous, notorious and adverse possession thereof before and ever since the 16th September, 1856, claiming and exercising acts of ownership over the same as the property of plaintiff' and of those under whom it claims; that the said town of Mason did accept said dedication of said streets and alleys and caused the same to be worked, and that the defendant’s title to said streets and alleys as made by said dedication is good and clear, and that the plaintiff has not a good, clear, legal or equitable title to the fee simple in said lands nor to any part of them; that it is not true that Front street, Anderson street, alley “D” and “Wide” alley have been enclosed by a good and substantial fence built by the parties under whom the plaintiff claims its title for more than ten years past (before the filing of the bill); it is not true that the dwelling-houses and other buildings were built on “Wide” alley and Front street more than nine years last past before the filing of the bill; that the use of said streets and alleys are not necessary for the successful prosecution of the plaintiff’s business; it is not true that it would be a great and irreparable injury to the plaintiff to tear down the fences and remove said buildings from said streets and alleys, but on the contrary it would greatly benefit the plaintiff to do so; and that since the filing of said bill the plaintiff has removed all obstructions from two of said streets and opened them to the public and delivered them, to the defendant and given it notice to work and keep them in repair. On April 22, 1879, the circuit court rendered in the cause a final decree as follows : “And this cause came on this day to he heard upon the bill and its exhibits, the answer of the defendant, the general replication thereto, and the motion to dissolve the injunction heretofore awarded in this cause, and on a motion to continue by complainant, which motion was overruled, and was argued by counsel; and upon mature consideration, the court is of opinion that the plaintiff is not entitled to the relief prayed for, and that said injunction ought to be dissolved. It is, therefore, adjudged, ordered and decreed that said injunction be and the same is hereby dissolved and the bill dismissed, and that the defendant recover of the plaintiff its costs by it about its defence in this behalf expended.” Froto this decree the plaintiff obtained an appeal and supersedeas from a judge of this Court.

Ejectment—proof not showing possession of plaintiff or forcible entry by defendant — evidence establishing prima facie case — proof raising questions for jury — adverse possession — evidence — conversation between prior owners — new trial — costs. Action of ejectment. Evidence examined, and held, that the plaintiff did not prove possession of the disputed parcel at any time after she received her deed, or prove a forcible entry by the defendant. The plaintiff did not obtain possession of the disputed parcel by fencing it where the defendant removed the fence the day after it was built, nor did such removal constitute a forcible entry. A plaintiff in ejectment having proved a deed of the premises in question to her predecessor in title, and his possession thereunder, makes a prima facie case and is entitled to recover unless the defendant proves that the plaintiff’s predecessor did not have legal title, or that he himself acquired title by adverse possession. Evidence of a conversation wherein the plaintiff’s predecessor stated to the defendant’s predecessor that he claimed the disputed parcel, but that the defendant’s predecessor might use it until wanted, is admissible to show that the defendant’s predecessor’s possession was subordinate to that of the plaintiff’s predecessor, and not adverse thereto. Evidence examined, and held, that the adverse possession of the defendant and his predecessor was a question of fact for the jury.

Defendant by answering over and going to trial on the merits waives any error to the action of the court in overruling his motion to require plaintiff to make his* petition more definite and certain, and cannot urge any error in that ruling on appeal. 2. ARGUMENT TO JURY: No Exception. A failure of defendant to save an exception to the court’s ruling on his objection that plaintiff’s remarks to the jury are prejudicial precludes any consideration of the remarks on appeal. 3. TRESPASS: Destruction of Fence: Loss of Pasture: Speculative Damages. Plaintiff is entitled to the loss of grass in his pasture caused by the repeated destruction ofi his fence, whereby his cattle passed out of the pasture, and because of which fact and to prevent the cattle from continually escaping and destroying other parts of his premises he was compelled to confine them in another inclosure. Such damage is not remote and speculative. 4. -: Participation in Wrong: Acts of Encouragement, Etc. In order that the owner of a farm may be legally responsible for the acts of his sons in destroying the fence which inclosed plaintiff’s land, it was not necessary that such owner should have been personally present participating in the destructive acts of the sons, but if he aided, counselled and encouraged them to do the act, by words or deeds, he is liable; and such participation may be established by ■circumstantial evidence. And the evidence in this case was sufficient to justify the jury in inferring that the owner of the adjoining farm did advise or encourage his sons in the destruction of the fence. $. -: Excessive Verdict: Destruction of Fences: $7500 Exemplary Damages. Exemplary damages cannot be accurately measured; but the character and standing of the parties, the malice with which the act was\\' done, and the financial condition of the defendant are elements which should be taken into consideration, and the amount may be such as will serve, by way of example and punishment, to deter the commission of other like acts. It is held in this case that a verdict of $510 for actual damages for the destruction of defendant’s fences, whereby he lost the grass of an eighty-acre pasture and his cattle escaped into and destroyed his five-acre orchard, was not excessive, but that a judgment of $7500 for exemplary damages is excessive by $6500. Error to Buchanan Circuit Court. — Hon. W. K. Amide, Judge. Affirmed (conditionally•). Hewitt é Hewitt and W. H. Haynes for plaintiffs In error. (1) The admission of the testimony as to the value of the Davies County eighty-acre pasture was ■error. It was not within the issues; such damage was speculative and remote. 13 Cyc. 23; Wynant v.

Sperry v. Hurd, 151 Mo. App. 579; Sperry v. Hurd, 130 Mo. App. 495. (3) The complainant’s prayer for exemplary damages, in the sum of ten thousand dollars, in view of the facts, is suggestive of a joke; but when it received the approval of the trial court, in instructions 8 and 9, viz., “and not exceeding ten thousand dollars exemplary. damages,” it presents itself stoutly clothed with the solemn garb of the law, which hides all its nakedness from the eye of .the layman, however diaphanous such a garb may appear to the sense of justice, carrying with it the inference that the court would approve same for |10,000. It was the poison injected into the minds of the jury that produced the verdict which will shock the conscience. of every reasonable person. The remittitur in nowise with- . drew the poison from the minds of the jury, nor cured the errors committed which caused this most partial and unfair trial, and excessive verdict. Mathew v.

(1) The plaintiff was deprived of the use of eighty acres of pasture land immediately east of his home forty by reason of the Hurds destroying his fences and knocking boards off of his fences — the destruction of the plaintiff’s fences by the defendants being the direct and only cause of the plaintiff losing this pasture.

(2) The evidence abundantly shows that James Hurd is liable and guilty. (3) The, general rule in regard to tres passes is that all who direct the commission of a trespass, or wrongfully contribute to its commission, or assent to it after it is committed, are equally liable to the injured person. Holliday v. Jackson, 21 Mo. App. 667; Dyer v. Tyrrell, 127 ¡S. W. 116; McMannus v. Lee, 40 Mo. 206; Cooper v. Johnson, 81 Mo. 485; Reed v. Peck, 163 Mo. 333. (4) The original verdict as rendered by the jury was not any more than is necessary to .properly punish the defendants for trying to perpetuate the methods of the Night Rider and the Ku Klux Klan. The fact that the last verdict is larger than the three previous verdicts is not evidence that the last verdict is excessive — the three previous verdicts were too low. Shohoney v.

Covenant. — Agreement to Maintain, Levee. — Covenant not Running with Land. —Right to Hater to Make Repairs. — Breach of Contract. — In 1877 the waterworks company of Indianapolis was in possession as owner of that part of the Central canal which is situated in Marion county, together with certain dams, etc., one of which was at Broad Bipple. An abutting owner near the dam at Broad Bipple, across whose land the waterworks company had built a levee, agreed with the company that if it would continue the levee to a certain point he would extend it across his land at his own expense, and maintain it, and release the company from all damages from high water in the past and future. At a judicial sale the water-works property was sold to the Indianapolis Water Company. The abutting owner having failed to keep his part of the levee in repair, it broke, and the water escaping washed out a part of a gravel road. The company paid damages to the gravel road company, and made repairs, the land-owner having failed to do so. Held, that the complaint, stating the facts as above, did not show a cause of action as to the first element of damages, it not appearing from any of the averments that there was any liability on the part of the waterworks company for injuries occasioned the gravel road company by overflows and freshets. Held, also, that the water company was not entitled to recover for repairs made, since the land-owner’s contract to repair did not create a covenant running with the land, and, therefore, the purchasing company ac- ' quired no rights under it. Held, also, that the company had no right under the contract to enter upon the land to make repairs, and could not recover for the repairs so made in an action for a breach of the contract to maintain the levee.

Id. — Adverse Possession—Deed from Party in Possession. — An entry under a deed, purporting to convey the title to a tract of land, made by one in possession of the property, is strong evidence of adverse possession, and tends to show a claim adverse to all the world. Id. — Continuous Possession—Constructive Possession under Deed. — Where the land so deeded was used for the ordinary purposes of the occupant for the full period of prescription, and the occupant paid all taxes thereupon, the fact that the fence was sometimes torn down or out of repair does not show that the possession was not continuous; but, in such case, the actual possession of part of the land deeded gave constructive possession of the whole tract described in the deed.

An incorporated drainage district possesses the character of a municipal corporation, and is not liable in double damages under section 4243, Revised Statutes 1919, for throwing down fences built across a drainage ditch without giving six months’ written notice to the person owning the adjoining cultivated fields. 2. FENCES: Unlawfully Building Fence Across Drainage Ditch: Removal: Damages: Not Recoverable. In view of section 4706, Revised Statutes 1919, relating to drainage ditches, levees, etc., declaring it a misdemeanor to build any fence, dam or other works across a drainage ditch, the owner of land who built a boundary fence across such ditch cannot recover damages for loss of cattle caused by the removal of the fence by the drainage district.

Appeal from Lincoln ■ Circuit Court. — Hon. E. M. Hughes, Judge. Reversed. Tins action of ejectment by respondent against the appellant was commenced August 24, 1887, for possession of a part of appellant’s roadbed and right of way across respondent’s farm in Lincoln county, Missouri. The ouster was laid January 1, 1887. The answer of defendant admitted it was a railroad corporation, and its possession of the land sued for ; denied the other allegations and relied on the statute of limitations. The answer, for a further defense, alleges that the St. Louis & Keokuk Railroad Company on August 8, 1870, obtained by purchase from Thomas G. Hutt and wife, who then owned the lands now owned by plaintiff, a deed conveying a right of way, one hundred feet wide, over said lands, and that said railroad fixed, located and established its right of way and graded the same over and upon the strip of land sued for and retained possession thereof until 1873, when it was succeeded by the St. Louis, Hannibal & Keokuk Rail - road Company, which last-mentioned company, between 1873 and 1882, finished and completed and put in operation its road from Hannibal to Gilmore, Missouri, and over and upon the lands sued for, and continued possession of said lands and operated said railroad to the seventh day of February, 1884, at which time by order and decree of the United States circuit court for the eastern district of Missouri, it with all its property, rights, etc., was placed in the hands of a receiver appointed by said court. That said receiver at once took possession and control of said railroad, its property, rights, etc., and retained the same until December 18, 1885, when a sale thereof was made by order and decree of said court to John I. Blair who afterwards transferred and conveyed the same to the defendant; that the deed from said Thomas G. Hutt to the St. Louis & Keokuk Railroad Company contained the following clause: “That said-railroad company shall construct two cattle passes under their track on said premises at such points as shall be selected by their said grantor, Thomas G. Hutt, and shall also build and maintain a good post and board fence on each side of their track through all inclosures on said premises within three months after said road shall be completed and trains run to Troy, Missouri; also make two crossings over said track in the field.” That, in 1883, the plaintiff, claiming to have purchased the lands of said T. G. Hutt, commenced his suit in the circuit court of Lincoln county, Missouri, to have the grant of the right of way made by said Hutt declared forfeited by reason of non-compliance with the requirements in said deed, and in 1884, without service of notice or summons upon or appearance of the receiver of said St. Louis, Hannibal & Keokuk Railroad Company, obtained judgment in said circuit court, decreeing and declaring the said right of way forfeited, .and that said judgment was void and of no effect. That plaintiff was estopped from claiming any benefit or advantages from said decree so rendered by the said Lincoln county circuit court, for the reason that after obtaining said decree and after this defendant had purchased said railroad and all its franchises and right of way, plaintiff acquiesced in and recognized defendant’s right to the same and by his conduct waived all claim thereto and by his conduct induced defendant to lay out large sums in maintaining said right of way and constructing fences along the same, and also filed an intervening petition in the United States circuit court for the eastern district of Missouri, in which he admitted defendant’s right to said right of way and possession thereof, but sought to recover damages for the same in the sum of $5,000 and have the same declared a- lien on defendant’s said railroad : that by the allegations in his said petition and submitting himself to the jurisdiction of said court he waived all advantage he might have obtained by his decree in the Lincoln circuit, court; that said United States circuit court decreed he was not entitled thereto, and said judgment was final. Plaintiff’s reply was a general denial of the new matter in the answer. A jury was waived and cause heard by the court. This state of facts is developed by the evidence : The right of way belonged to Thomas 0. Hutt in 1870, and was a part of his farm of five hundred and fifty-two acres in Lincoln county. On August 18, 1870, T. Gr. Hutt and wife, by their deed of that date, duly executed and acknowledged and recorded in book Z, page 77, conveyed the right of way, one hundred feet wide, through said farm to the St. Louis & Keokuk Railroad Company, for $100, subject to the following conditions: That said railroad company shall constnoct two cattle passes under their tracks on said premises at such points as shall be selected by said grantors, to-wit: Thomas O. Hutt, and shall also build and maintain a good post and board fence on each side of their tracks through all inclosures on said premises within three months after said road shall be completed and trains run to Troy, Missouri; also make two crossings over said track in the fields. And provided further, that, if said railroad shall not be constructed over and across said premises in ten years from that date, the land should revert to the grantors. Under and by virtue of this deed the St. Louis & Keokuk railroad took possession of the right of way, located and graded its road in 1872. Col. Hutt, the grantor, was then living on the farm and continued to reside there until November 23,1882, when he conveyed the farm to plaintiff. On March 4, 1873, the St. Louis, Hannibal & Keokuk Railroad Company succeeded to all the rights and franchises of the St. Louis & Keokuk railroad, and prior to the year 1881 said road was completed and put in operation from Hannibal to Gilmore. The railroad has been in operation all the time since 1881. On the twenty-third of November, 1882, Thomas G. Hutt conveyed the farm to plaintiff, McClellan, ‘ ‘subject to the right of way granted to railroad.” Plaintiff, J. M. McClellan, testified in his own behalf, that the right of way contained about twelve acres; was worth $4 or $5 per acre, for rents, and that he was damaged $250 or $300. Cross-examination: “The railroad was built and in operation when I bought the land in 1882. The fills and cuts were made. No change in roadbed. Rent worth $1 per acre. The farm is worth more with the railroad through it than it would be without a railroad. The building of the railroad has enhanced the value of the lands. The railroad was located and graded over the lands in 1872, when Col. Hutt lived on the place. He lived there till he sold it to me in 1882, and knew the railroad was completed and in operation. The road has been in operation all the time since 1881. Told Walker, the superintendent, that if he did not fence the road I would have the deed forfeited. The company put in three cattle-guards, at my reguest' After the decree of forfeiture the company, at my request, 'built some fence. I wrote to Mr. Case, the-superintendent, to have the right of way cleaned out. He sent a lot of hands and had it done, It was at my request. I wrote him a letter making the request, and called his attention to the fact that the law required, that every railroad should clean off its right of way. The company built a fence after the decree of forfeiture. I objected only because it was not the kind of fence I. wanted. I employed an attorney in St. Louis in 1885, after the decree of forfeiture, to bring suit in the United States court against the railroad company for taking and appropriating the right of way.” Redirect examination : “ The company built a five-wire fence part of the way before the decree of forfeiture, at my request. I notified them to clean off the-right of way because the statute required it.” Recross examination: “I objected to the fences, the company built because they would not turn anything. In my letter to the company I told them that the law required them to clean out the right of way.” Gf. L. Thurmond testified : “Am acquainted with the land where the railroad runs through McClellan’s farm ; the rental value of the twelve acres would be fifty cents or $1 per acre.” Cross-examination: “Lived near the land when railroad was put in operation. No change has been made. It has all been fenced for three years or more.” About March 1, 1883, the plaintiff, McClellan, commenced an action in the circuit court of Lincoln county, Missouri,against the St. Louis, Hannibal & Keokuk Railroad Company to forfeit and declare null the deed from Hutt to the company for the right of way, for failure to build the fences and make the passes mentioned in the deed. The papers.in the case are lost. The recoi’d. entries are somewhat confusing. In one, it is denominated an action for “damages,” and in another, “injunction however, Mr. Dunn, who was the attorney, says there was only one case, and that was for “specific- performance,” or to declare a forfeiture. R. H. Norton, Esq., appeared for defendant, and filed a demurrer ; at the spring term, 1884, it appears that Mr. Norton withdrew as counsel for the railroad and the cause was from that time entirely undefended. On April 2, 1884, the circuit court of Lincoln county made a conditional decree, reciting .TIutt’s deed to the railroad, and the condition in it that said company should construct two cattle passes under its track at such points as should be selected by Hutt, and should maintain the fences, and ordered that the railroad proceed in sixty days to construct two cattle passes at such points as plaintiff might select, etc., and, in default, the whole right of way would be declared forfeited and the deed null and void. At the fall term, 1884, these passes not having been constructed, the decree was made final, forfeiting the right of way. In the meantime, and while the suit was pending in the circuit court of Lincoln county, I). C. Blair, as trustee for certain bondholders, in a mortgage executed by said railroad company, commenced a suit in equity in the United States circuit court for the eastern district of Missouri, and, on his application, on February 7, 188J/., one Edwin C. Case was duly appointed receiver of said railroad, qualified and took charge of all its property. It seems that this receiver never employed Mr. Norton to take any further steps in the Lincoln court. This receiver remained in charge of the railroad until March 30, 1886. It does not appear that the receiver had any notice that the suit of plaintiff for the forfeiture was pending in Lincoln. Nor was the order commanding the company to build the fences and passes in sixty days served on him. After the decree of forfeiture in the Lincoln circuit court, on June 5, 1885, plaintiff filed his intervening petition in the United States circuit court, in the foreclosure proceeding of D. C. Blair against the railroad company, in which he recites his title and the forfeiture and then, proceeding, makes this allegation : “Your petitioner further avers that he has 'a lien upon said strip of land constituting the right of way of said St. Louis, Hannibal & Keokuk Railroad Company, paramount and superior to the rights of complaint of all persons claiming by, or through, or under, said St. Louis, Hannibal & Keokuk Railroad .Company ; that, by reason of the construction and location of said road through its premises and the appropriation of said right of way by said St. Louis, Hannibal & Keokuk Railroad Company, your petitioner is damaged in the sum of $5,000; wherefore he prays judgment for said amount, and that the same may be (declared a first lien upon said strip of land and the property of said railroad company with prior rights to the mortgages sued on, and for such other relief as may seem meet and just.” According to the practice in the federal court in equity, this intervening petition was referred to B. Gratz Brown, a special master, together with the' demurrer of the complainant thereto. This demurrer was sustained by the special master, and his ruling afterwards, on June 25, 1885, was confirmed by the United States circuit Court, and plaintiff ’ s intervening petition dismissed. The defendant below offered in evidence the report of the master, and the order of the court above referred to; but, upon objection, the court excluded said records, to which defendant duly objected and excejjted. Under a decree of the United States circuit court in the foreclosure proceedings, the St. Louis, Hannibal & Keokuk Railroad Company, its property, franchises, etc., were sold and conveyed by master’s deed, in December, 1885, to John I. Blair. John I. Blair, in February, 1886, conveyed the road to the defendant in this case, the St. Louis & Hannibal Railway Company. At the conclusion of the evidence the court declared the law as follows: “The court, sitting as a jury, is instructed to find a verdict for the plaintiff in this cause.” To the giving of which the defendant duly-excepted. The following instructions were asked by the defendant and refused by the court: “1. The court, sitting as a jury, is instructed that, under the pleadings and the evidence in this cause, the verdict will be for the defendant. “2. The court is instructed that the St. Louis, Hannibal & Keokuk Railroad Company acquired all the right, title, property and franchise of the St. Louis & Keokuk Railroad Company, and that all the right, title, property and franchises of the St. Louis, Hannibal & Keokuk Railroad Company were transferred and passed to John I. Blair by the deeds read in evidence, and that the deed read in evidence from John I. Blair to the St. Louis & Hannibal Railroad Company conveyed to said last-named.railway company all the right, title, property and franchises of the said John I. Blair. ‘‘ 3. Although the court may believe that the deed made by Thomas G. Hutt to the St. Louis & Keokuk Railroad Company was declared forfeited by the circuit court of Lincoln county, Missouri, yet, if you further find that, at the time the said decree or judgment of forfeiture was rendered by said circuit court, the St. Louis, Hannibal & Keokuk Railroad Company had been, and was then, under the control, care and possession of Edwin C. Case, as such receiver, and was not made a party to such suit, and did not enter his appearance therein as defendant, then the verdict will be for the defendant. “4. Although the court may believe, from the evidence, that the deed made by Thomas G. Hutt and wife to the St. Louis & Keokuk Railroad Company was declared forfeited by the decree or judgment of the circuit court of Lincoln county, Missouri; yet, if you further find that, after the rendition of said decree or judgment, the plaintiff acquiesced in, or consented to, the use and occupation of the land sued for, as the right of way of the St. Louis, Hannibal & Keokuk Railroad Company, or the St. Louis & Hannibal Railroad Company, then the plaintiff cannot recover in this action and the verdict will be for the defendant. “5. And the court is further instructed that, if the plaintiff, after the rendition of said decree or judgment, notified and required the defendant to clean off and remove from said strip of land the vegetation and undergrowth thereon, and the said defendant, in pursuance of said notice, did clean off and remove such vegetation and undergrowth, then such act of the plaintiff must be construed to be an acquiescence and consent to the use and occupation of said strip of land as a right of way for defendant’s railroad. “6. If the court believes, from the evidence, that the plaintiff, after the decree of forfeiture, presented his intervening petition to the United States court in the case of D. C. Blair, trustee, v. the St. Louis, Hannibal & Keokuk Railroad Company for damages for the taking and appropriating the said strip of land for the right of way of the said railroad, then such act, upon the plaintiff’s part, was a waiver of his right to the possession of said lands, and the verdict will be for the defendant. “7. Although the court may believe, from the evidence, that the conditions mentioned and set out'in the deed from Thomas Gr. Hutt to the St. Louis & Keokuk Railroad Company were not complied with, and the decree .of the circuit court of Lincoln county, Missouii, declared said deed forfeited for failure to fulfill and perform the conditions, yet such failure did not, and does not, give the plaintiff any right to said lands as against the St. Louis & Keokuk Railroad Company and its assigns. “8. If the court find, from the evidence, that Thomas Gf. Hutt, the plaintiff’s grantor, consented to the occupation of the lands in controversy by the said St. Louis & Keokuk Railroad Company and its assigns, for the purpose of constructing, building and operating a railroad thereon, upon conditions expressed in the deed of said Thomas Gr. Hutt to said railroad company, even though the court should find that the said railroad company and its assigns did not comply with such conditions, the verdict will be for the defendant. “9. If the court believes, from the evidence in this case, that the defendant, and those under whom it claims, have been in open, notorious and adverse possession of the lands herein sued for, claiming to own the same for a period of ten years, or more next before the commencement of this suit by plaintiff, the verdict will be for the defendant. “10. If the court believe, from the evidence, that the plaintiff bought the land on which the railroad was constructed and operated, subject to the right of way previously granted by Thomas Gr. Hutt and wife to the defendant railway company, or those under whom it claims, and that said defendant railway company, or those under whom it claims, entered and took possession of and occupied said right of way, by and with the consent of Thomas Gr. Hutt and wife, then the verdict must be for the defendant. “11. If the court find, from the evidence, that the St. Louis & Keokuk Railroad Company took possession of said strip of land in 1872 or 1873, under the deed read in evidence from Thomas Gr. Hutt and wife, and excavated and graded said strip of land and put the same in condition for receiving ties, rails, etc., and the defendant was in possession of said lands at the commencement of this suit, then the presumption is that the St. Louis & Keokuk Railroad Company and its assigns have remained in possession of said lands from the first entry thereof until the commencement of this suit. “12. The court instructs that the decree of the circuit court of Lincoln county, Missouri, declaring the deed made by Thomas Gf. Hutt to the St. Louis & Keokuk Railroad Company forfeited for conditions broken, did not give the plaintiff any better right to sue for the possession of said lands than he had before the rendition of said decree. “13. The court instructs that, although it may believe, from the evidence, that the conditions in the deed from Thomas Gf. Hutt and wife to the St. Louis & Keokuk Railroad Company were broken, yet, if they (it) further find that said plaintiff is a purchaser of said lands from said Hutt, then the said plaintiff cannot take advantage of said broken conditions, and the verdict will be for the defendant.” Judgment for plaintiff for possession, rents and profits. Defendant’s motion for new trial, which was overruled, assigned the following reasons : First. Because the judgment is against the evidence. Second. Because the verdict is against the law of the case. Third. Because the court erred in giving instructions for plaintiff. Fourth. Because the court erred in refusing to give instructions asked by defendant. Fifth. Because the court admitted illegal and improper evidence offered by plaintiff. Sixth. Because the court refused to admit proper and legal evidence offered by defendant. Seventh. Because the judgment should have been for the defendant instead of for the plaintiff. J. II. Orr and Martin & Avery for appellant. (1) The record of the deeds from Thomas Gf. Hutt and wife to St. Louis & Keokuk Railroad Company, and from Hutt to plaintiff, was not the best evidence. The loss of the originals was not proved nor any effort made to produce them. The interlocutory and final judgment in the forfeiture suit of plaintiff against the St. Louis, Hannibal & Keokuk Railroad Company should not have been admitted. The objections thereto should have been sustained. The circuit court had no jurisdiction to proceed in the cause after the receiver had been appointed by the federal court.

It was the duty of the court to declare the legal effect of defendant’s deeds, as asked in the second instruction. Hunt v. Railroad, 75 Mo. 252. (3) The fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth instructions should have been given. If the plaintiff acquiesced in or consented to the use and occupation of the land for a right of way (as asked in the fourth instruction), or required the railroad company to remove the undergrowth (as asked in the fifth instruction), or presented his intervening petition for damages for such use and occupation (as asked in the sixth instruction), or if Thomas Gf. Hutt consented to the occupation of said lands (as asked in the eighth instruction), ejectment will not lie. ProvoU v. Railroad, 57 Mo. 256; Hubbard v. Railroad, 63 Mo. 68; Kanaga v. Railroad, 76 Mo. 207; Gray v. Railroad, 81 Mo. 124, 134; Baker v. Railroad, 57 Mo. 265. IVhen the owner of lands does not insist upon the prepayment or other consideration for right of way, but, by acquiescence or license, induces or permits the company to take possession and construct the road, he cannot maintain ejectment thereafter for the lands. Bradley «. Railroad, 91 Mo. 493; Beck v. Railroad, 21 N. E. Rep. 471. The evidence show.s that the strip of land sued for had been in the possession of the defendant, and those under whom it claims, since 1872, more than ten years before the commencement of this suit, and the plaintiff’s claim or title, if any, was barred by the statute of limitations, as asked in the ninth and tenth instructions. Key v. Jennings, 66 Mo. 353 ; Bradley v. Railroad, 91 Mo. 493 ; 100 Mo. 210. And the continuance of the possession shown in the St. Louis & Keokuk railroad will be presumed as asked in the eleventh instruction. Lawson on Presumptive Evidence, 163. Only the grantor or his heirs are entitled to declare a forfeiture for conditions broken. The plaintiff in the forfeiture suit was neither, and it should have been so declared as asked in instruction, numbered 13. Pierce .on Railroads, 136 ; Knight v. Railroad, 70 Mo. 231. (4) If we concede that the decree of the circuit court in the forfeiture suit of the plaintiff had the effect to nullify and make of no effect the deed from Iiutt to the St. Louis & Keokuk Railroad Company, still such effect could only be given to it from the date of the decree It did not make it void ab initio. Hubbard v. Railroad, 63 Mo. 68. (5 ) The plaintiff lived upon the land from 1882 to the fall of 1887 before commencing this suit. He knew the road was being operated all that time; had the company build fences, cattle-guards, etc., and clear out the right of way of undergrowth, etc.; filed his intervening petition in the United States circuit court for damages, etc. Under such circumstances ejectment cannot be maintained for the roadbed. Kanaga v. Railroad, 76 Mo. 207-213. Norton & Dunn for respondent. (1) The testimony of J. M. McClellan sufficiently accounts for the loss of the original deed from Thomas G. Hutt and wife to the St. Louis & Keokuk Railroad Company and from the former to. McClellan to authorize the introduction in evidence of the record of said deeds. (2) The interlocutory and final judgment in the forfeiture suit was properly admitted. The circuit court of Lincoln county, Missouri, acquired jurisdiction of the parties and the subject-matter of the suit, and its decree declaring a forfeiture, having not been appealed from, was final and cannot be attacked in a collateral proceeding. When the jurisdiction of a court, and the right of a plaintiff to prosecute his suit in it, have once attached that right cannot be arrested and taken away by proceedings in any other court. Seibel «. Simeon, 62 Mo. 255; Hardin v. Lee, 51 Mo.' 241; Kills v. Jones, 51 Mo. 180; Hill v. Taylor, 3 Mo. App. 351. ( 3) The statute of limitations constitutes no defense in this case. The grantor had a right to presume that the railroad company would comply with the conditions in the conveyance of right of way as soon as the railroad was built and cars running to Troy, Missouri, and that event did not happen until the year 1881, and not until after that time could any suit for forfeiture or damages be brought against the railroad company for failure to comply with the conditions in the grant of right of way, hence the statute would not commence to run until that time. Rice v. Railroad, 55 Mo. '146. (4) The facts in this case do not make out an estoppel. (5) Ejectment is the proper remedy. Where a company proceed to build their road upon land to which they have not acquired the necessary title, either by condemnation under the statute, or by conveyance from the owner, or by some permission that gave them authority, they will be liable to be ousted by ejectment.

Van Ness Ordinance.—The inclosure of a lot in San Francisco by building a fence around it made of posts eight feet apart and five feet high, with two boards nailed on the same, without actual occupation or cultivation of the lot, did not give such possession of the same to the person inclosing as to pass the title to him under the Van Ness Ordinance. Adverse Possession op Land.—One claiming to have acquired a title to land by five years adverse possession, need only show that his adverse possession was held by a substantial inclosuro, and need not prove occupation, cultivation, or use of the premises. What constitutes Prior Possession op Land.—The plaintiff in ejectment who claims to recover on the ground of prior possession alone, without color of title, must show an actual prior possession; and if he shows that he had the land protected by a substantial inclosuro, even if he had not improved or lived on it, this constitutes an actual possession. A substantial inclosure is such a fence as a prudent farmer would erect to protect growing crops. Proof of Prior Possession.—If the plaintiff in ejectment relies on prior possession alone, without color of title, proof that he had the land inclosed with a fence made of posts eight feet apart, with two rails nailed on, is not sufficient to establish such prior possession. Appeal from the District Court, Fourth Judicial District, City and County of San Francisco. Ejectment to recover a lot of land four hundred and twelve and a half feet in length and one hundred and thirty-seven and a half feet wide, being Fifty Yara Lots One, Two, and Three, of Block Two Hundred and Eighty-nine of the Western Addition to San Francisco. The defendants entered into possession of the demanded premises in October, 1862. When plaintiff rested, defendants moved for a nonsuit, because plaintiff had not shown such a prior possession as would enable her to recover in ejectment. The Court denied the motion. Plaintiff recovered judgment, and defendants appealed. The other facts are stated in the opinion of the Court. E. A. Lawrence, for Appellants. Such a possession as was proved by plaintiff in this case, has been several times held by the Court to be insufficient to maintain ejectment. (Hutton v. Schumaker, 21 Cal. 453; Wolf v. Baldwin, 19 Cal. 306; Lawrence v. Fulton, 19 Cal. 690.) The mere building a fence is not sufficient. Casual acts of ownership are not sufficient to carry after them the title to the land. (Lawrence v. Fulton, 19 Cal. 690.) The case of Lawrence v. Fulton was ejectment for land in San Francisco outside of the lines of the Van Ness Ordinance. The testimony in favor of plaintiff was much stronger than in this case. He showed a much better possession, accompanied with a residence on the land, adjoining; yet he was defeated in the Court below, mainly by the charge, “ that to enable plaintiff to recover, they (the jury) must be satisfied that the person under whom he (plaintiff) claimed, had had an actual, bona fide occupation, and had subjected the land to his will and control for some space of time ; that mere assertion of title, coupled with casual acts of owner ship, is not sufficient.” The Supreme Court held this charge to be correct. Spencer & Jarboe, for Respondent. Every act, definite, positive and notorious, which conspicuously manifests the intention of a present appropriation, constitutes the possession, which is sufficient to maintain ejectment against any intruder who has not the better title. What are the acts that are definite, positive and notorious, the law cannot and does not pretend to determine. It—the law—announces the principle, and leaves its application to the varying circumstances of life, and its perpetual change and modification to be determined by a jury, aided and enlightened by an intelligent Judge.',\n",

       "  'case_summary': \"SMITH v. THE STATE. 1. If, in the course of a trial, witnesses testify to a particular state of facts, it is no error in the court, in the charge, to say that those facts are proved, and. that if the jury believed these witnesses, the .legal right was established by it. 2. If the actual corner made by the intersection of two streets has been treated and considered by the owner of a lot at the corner as the boundary of the lot, and has been the corner called for in the previous conveyances, a deed by such owner calling for “ the corner ” of the two streets generally as its beginning point, will begin at such actual corner, and not at a corner which may be found to be the corner made by an accurate plotting of the surveys laying out the streets. 3. If a street has been used and built up along a particular line, and the adjoining owners have acquiesced in the line so built upon, and treated it as the true line of the street for forty or fifty years, they cannot be permitted to change or correct the course of the street by showing that the surveys laying it out give it a different direction. 4. The use of land by the public as a highway or street for more than twenty years, and the acquiescence of the owner in such use, is conclusive proof of dedication. 5. The practical location of boundaries upon which others have been induced to act shall conclude those who adopt such location, even if erroneous. 6. A strip of land adjoining a public highway, regularly laid out, may become dedicated by acquiescence in the use of it, as a part of thehighway by the public. Error to Passaic Oyer and Terminer. The defendant below was indicted for a nuisance in obstructing a public highway in the town of Paterson by a building, the front walls of which, as alleged, were erected upon the street. The indictment charges, that on 1st July, 1849, and for a long time before, there was, and still of right ought to be, a common and public highway, leading from Main street, eastwardly, to Straight street, in the town of Paterson, for the inhabitants of this state, on foot and with their horses and carriages, to pass and repass at their free will and pleasure; and that on the said day J. S., the defendant, unlawfully dug up a part of said street, and erected upon it the walls of a building; and the walls so erected the defendant still maintains and continues, whereby the said street is obstructed and narrowed, so that the citizens of the said state cannot pass and repass, as they ought and were accustomed to do, &c. The defendant was tried and convicted in the Passaic Oyer and Terminer, before the Chief Justice, at its Juno sessions 1849. Exceptions were sealed to the charge of the court to the jury, and the judgment of the Oyer and Terminer was removed by writ of error. The charge was as follows : “ The issue which you are sworn to try involves two questions, viz.” 1st. Is there a common public highway, as charged in the indictment? 2d. Has the defendant, by his building, which it is admitted he erected, narrowed or obstructed that highway ? A public highway in Hew Jersey may be established (as the counsel of both parties agree) either — 1st. By the act of surveyors of the highways in laying out the road according to the statute. 2d, By the uninterrupted use and enjoyment of the road as a highway by the public for a period not less than twenty years. 3d. By the dedication of the land by the owner to the use of the public as a highway. In the present case the state relies upon dedication by the owner, and a long uninterrupted use by the public, as proof of the existence of a highway at the place in question. The oldest witness speaks of a post and rail fence on the south side of Broadway, which formerly crossed where Main street now is, before that street was opened. This was followed by a paling or picket fence, which extended from the corner of Main street, and joined up to the Berry house. There was another fence, which extended from the Berry house, further east, to the Mitchell house. At a later period, Garrabrant Van Houten moved a barn on the corner of Main street and Broadway, and connected it with a store. The building was placed, as the witnesses testify, on a line with' where the paling fence formerly stood, the porch or steps projecting beyond the line into the street. In 1821 Parsons bought the corner, and from that time it is undenied and very clearly proved that the fences and lines have remained unchanged until the defendant erected his building. I do not particularize the evidence, but, so far as I recollect, all the witnesses agree that there has been no material change in the south side of Broadway, from St. John’s Hal-1 to the corner of Main street, within the memory of the witnesses, within which lines the defendant’s building is erected. It is further ^aid, on behalf of the defendant, that the mere fact that an owner of land chooses to leave it unfenced, does' not divest him of his property or give a right of way to the public. It is certainly true that a landholder may leave his land adjoining a highway unenclosed and open to the public. He may permit the public to use it, for the purpose of passing and repassing, and yet vest no right in the public. It is said, again, that the mere fact that a man opens the street up to his house, if he leaves his porch or cellar door extending into the street, it protects his right. This is undoubtedly true, if there be in fact no dedication of the land to the use of the public. As a general rule, the right of the public, where it is a question of dedication, may not extend beyond their actual enjoyment, nor, on the other hand, will having a porch, or steps, or area, within the limits of the street deprive the public of their right or restrict the limits of the highway. The use by the public of private property, or the appropriation of a public street to individual use, for the necessary purposes of steps or porches, may be permissive merely without conferring any right. This brings us to the question, whether in fact this land was used by the public with the assent of the owners, and with a recognition, on their part, of the right of the public to the use of the road in the place where the defendant’s building is erected. It appears in evidence that, on the 1st of May, 1807, Peter Wilson conveyed the corner lot, 100 feet on Main street and 50 feet deep, bounding north on Broadway and south on Van Houten’s land, to Simeon Van Houten. On the 6th of May, 1820, Peter Van Houten and wife conveyed to Garrabrant Van Houten, describing the lot as 100 feet on Main street and 50 feet deep. Garrabrant Van Houten erected the store house on the corner where the picket fence formerly stood. This must have been done in the year 1820, as on the 5th of March, 1821, he conveyed to Parsons. A strong confirmation of the fact, that the position of the south line of Broadway has not been changed, is found in the condition of the lots lying east of the defendant’s lot, and extending 100 feet on Broadway to St. John’s Hall, or the Society’s line. These lots are bounded on the north by Broadway, and extend back 100 feet in depth ; they were laid out, mapped, numbered, and sold by Abraham Van Houten. Those lots, on measurement, are now found to be 100 feet deep. In 1821, Garrabrant Van Houten conveyed to Andrew Parsons the corner lot, 100 feet on Main street, also the Simeon Van Houten lot, extending 55 feet on Main street. In 1820, Parson bought of Winans a lot of 40 feet front on Main street, beginning at 155 feet from the corner of Main street and Broadway. This lot adjoined the land he afterwards purchased of Van Houten on the south, and made his entire front on Main street, extending south from the corner of Broadway, 195 feet. Parson held the entire lot from 5th March, 1821, till the 14th December, 1835, a period of more than fourteen years. He bought his entire front for 195 feet. This is the measurement called for in his deeds. He held that quantity. That, according to his own testimony, was all he claimed or occupied. He measured it repeatedly. Beyond the 195 feet was the street.. •He never claimed where the street was open and used by the public. On the 14th December, 1835, Parsons conveyed by deed to Aaron S. Pennington and four others for $25,500. This deed describes the land thus: “Beginning on the eastwardly of the Paterson and Hamburg turnpike, at the southeast corner of its intersection with Broadway, or the old York road, then running south, along the turnpike, 195 feet, to the line of Van Biarcom.” Parsons sold for a high price, every foot of the land on Main street being of great value. The description in his deed to Pennington and others manifestly calls for the corner of the street, as it actually was at that time. He testifies that he held, and sold only to that corner. It is obvious, moreover, that the whole plot will be deranged by shifting that corner to the point where the defendant now seeks to fix it. From the 14th of December, 1835, Pennington and his associates held it until the 5th of May, 1849, when a part of the lot, including ,the spot where the defendant’s building now stands, was conveyed to the defendant. Mr. Pennington testifies, that while he and his associates held, a period of more than thirteen years, they never changed the lines of the lot or enlarged the possession, as they received it from Parsons. The ownership and possession of Parsons and Pennington, the previous owners of this land, and from whom the defendant derives his title, extends from 1821 to 1849, a period of more than twenty-eight years. Mr. Pennington testifies that he had the entire length of line upon Main street called for in his deed, and a foot over, within the bounds of the lot, as he held it. At the rate that Pennington and his associates sold to the defendant (20 feet 8 inches for $4450, or about $215 per foot,) the 4 feet 4 inches now occupied by the defendant’s building beyond the line, as conveyed to him, would amount to more than $980. This lot, before it was conveyed to the defendant, was owned for many years by intelligent business men, who knew Paterson well; and it is remarkable that, notwithstanding the •high price at which they sold the land, they did not attempt to sell or convey to the defendant beyond the line they actually occupied. This fact shows unequivocally that they did not claim more. It shows, moreover, that the street, beyond the line to whioli they occupied, was used by the public with their knowledge and assent. If there were no evidence in the cause previous to the year 1821, when Parsons acquired title, it is nevertheless shown that the public have used the lands where the defendant’s building is erected, with the assent of the owners, for more than twenty-five years. If you believe the witnesses, this evidence establishes the public right. If this be so, it is not material where the road was originally laid out, or whether the lines of the street, as occupied, correspond with the lines of the original survey, or whether the road was ever laid out by surveyors of the highways. The public have acquired by use a right, to the road, as good as if the street had been originally laid out where it now is according to law. This view of the case renders it unnecessary to advert particularly to the evidence adduced before you to show where the true lines of the street would be, if laid out strictly in accordance with the original survey. The act of the township officers in not working the road, and of the surveyors of the highways and of the counsel of the township in not correcting the error, (if it actually exists) cannot relieve the defendant from liability. Á public common right is involved. The right of the people to a public highway cannot he lost by a mistake of the agents^r servants, or by their misapprehension of the right of the public. On this account I have felt it my duty to state my views of the law clearly and unequivocally, that there may be no misapprehension on this point by the jury. If I am in error, there is a mode of redress of which the defendant may avail itself. I. have been the more explicit because it has been stated, in your hearing by counsel, that the defendant acted under an impression, prevalent in Paterson, that if he built on the line of the street as originally laid out he was safe in so doing. This impression, if it really exists, is in my judgment a dangerous error. No man is justified in depriving the people of a common right of stopping or obstructing an ancient highway, though never laid out agreeably to law. If he build within the line of the street, as it actually exists, he acts at his peril, and if he thereby creates a nuisance, it may and ought to be abated, either by the act of the parties specially aggrieved or by force of law. If you find, upon the evidence in this cause, that the defendant’s house is located within the bounds of a public street, actually opened and used by the people as a highway for more than twenty years, and especially if you find that the street has been so used with the knowledge and assent of the owners, of the land now occupied by the defendant, and under whom the defendant claims, the building erected by the defendant is a nuisance, and your verdict should be .guilty.” The defendant, by his counsel, excepted to the aforesaid charge of the court— 1st. Because the jury were therein expressly told, and a large part of said charge assumed it as an established fact, that the land in controversy had been dedicated by the owners to public use, aud used by the public as a public highway for a sufficient length of time to establish the same in law, whereas the question» of such dedication and use are properly questions for the jury, and should have been left open for their decision. 2d. Because, by said charge, the court instructed the jury that the description in Parsons’ “ deed to Pennington and others manifestly called for the corner of the street, as it actually was at that time.” 3d. Because, by said charge, the jury were instructed that it was “not material where the road was originally laid out, or whether the lines of the street, as occupied,, correspond with the lines of the original survey, or whether the road was ever laid out by surveyors of the-highways.” 4th. Because the court, by their said charge, instructed the jury that the act of the township officers, in not working the road, and of the overseer of the highways and the counsel of the township, in not correcting the error (if any actually existed), cannot relieve the defendant .from liability, Eor the foregoing reasons, the defendant, by his counsel, prays a bill of exceptions to the said charge, which is allowed -and sealed accordingly. The cause was argued, on error, by F. T. Frelinghuysen and Vroom, for plaintiff in error, and by A. 0. Zubriskie, for the state, before the Chief Justice and Justices Nevius and Carpenter.\",\n",

       "  'case_summary': \"George T. Quick v. Louisa Nitschelm et al. Filed at Ottawa October 31, 1891. 1. Boundary—division lines—settled by parol agreement of adjoining land owners. The owners of adjoining tracts of land may, by parol agreement, settle and establish permanently a boundary line between their lands, which, when followed by possession and the making of improvements, will be binding and conclusive, and can not afterward be disputed. 2. But such an agreement must be clearly proven, and can not be implied from slight acts of the parties, though it may sometimes be implied from their unequivocal acts. There must have been a dispute as to the boundary lines, and the parties acting must have had authority to do so. 3. Same—power of agent to establish. Power in an agent to sell two ■or more adjoining lots does not involve and imply authority to make a parol agreement as to the boundaries between the lots. A power to sell ■does not authorize a partition of the property. 4. So one acting as agent of a non-resident owner of lots to sell the same, in effecting a sale of a lot represented that a fence on an adjoining lot held by a third person constituted the eastern boundary of the lot sold, in pursuance of which representation the purchaser, in fencing ¡her lot on the west, encroached eleven feet on the lot west of the one ■bought, which her grantor owned. At that time there was no dispute ns to the location of the lots, or their boundaries or division lines, nor was it shown that the agent had any authority to do anything more than to sell, or had knowledge that the fence first above named was not on the line of such lot. It was held, that there was no estoppel upon & subsequent purchaser of the lot on the west, to prevent him from showing the true line between the two lots. 5. Same—estoppel in pais. Estoppels in pais, affecting permanent interests in land, are available only in courts of equity; and if one party makes representations, either in words or conduct, which induce . the other party to accept a particular line as the correct boundary, such, representations can not be regarded as constituting an estoppel in pais, unless the party making them had full knowledge of all the facts, or had been guilty of gross negligence in failing to learn such facts. 6. Estoppel —primes of grantors—grantees. Privies of a grantor who is estopped in respect of the boundaries of the land conveyed, will not be estopped in respect thereto if they are subsequent purchasers for value without any notice that their grantor is estopped. To make an estoppel binding on grantees it must be affirmatively shown that they had notice of the equities against their grantor, out of which the estoppel is claimed to have arisen. Appeal from the Circuit Court of Peoria county • the Hon. Thomas M. Shaw, Judge, presiding. Messrs. Kellogg & Cameron, for the appellant: A disputed boundary may be settled by the parties by a parol agreement, when followed by possession. But the evidence of the establishing of the adopted line must be clear, positive and unequivocal. McNamara v. Seaton, 82 Ill. 500. An estoppel in pais, affecting title to real estate, is available only in a court of equity. Winslow v. Cooper, 104 Ill. 239. Possession must be adverse, or the limitation will not run. Dow v.

Defendant cattle company maintained a post and wire fence 44 miles long around 37,000 acres of land, 26,000 of which was public land and 11,000 privately owned, the most of it by defendant. It was for the most part bottom land and practically surrounded that owned by the government. No part of the fence was on the public land. There were about nine openings in the fence each 100 feet or more in length but separated by long distances and some where the ground was very rough and almost inaccessible.

       "  'case_summary': \"[No. 2,509.] HENRY CONROY and JAMES ROCHE v. CHARLES P. DUANE et al. Transcript on Appeal.—The insertion, in. a transcript; of conveyances and records at full length, instead of briefly stating their substance and effect, and the copying verbatim of the testimony of witnesses by questions and answers, instead of stating so .much of the substance of the evidence as relates to the errors assigned, imposes unnecessary labor on the Court, and cannot be too strongly condemned. Possession Necessary to Maintain Forcible Entry or Detainer.— In order to maintain an action for a forcible entry or a forcible detainer, the plaintiff must prove that, at the time of the ouster complained of, he was in the actual and peaceable possession of the demanded premises. A constructive and scrambling possession is not sufficient. Idem.—It is also necessary, in order to maintain such action, to prove that the defendant made a forcible entry, or forcibly detained the premises from the plaintiff. Possession op Land.—A sufficient inclosure is of itself an actual possession of land, without a residence upon it, cultivation, or other act of dominion. Natural Barrier Benders Fence Unnecessary.—A natural barrier,: such as a deep stream, a precipitous cliff, the shore of the ocean, and the like, will serve as a portion of an inclosure of land, and render a fence unnecessary in order to constitute possession. When Transfer of Title Carries Possession.—If one who is in the actual possession of a marsh or mud flat, incapable of habitation or use in its then condition, conveys his title and possession, and the vendee promptly prepares to assert his title and enter into possession, he acquires a possession which is sufficient to enable him to maintain forcible entry or unlawful detainer against an intruder, although at the time the intruder entered, he had exercised no actual dominion or control over the land. Proof of a Forcible Detainer.—One who goes upon the land several weeks after the alleged ouster and forcible detainer, simply as an employé of the parties who ousted the plaintiffs, and has no other connection with the transaction, is not guilty of an unlawful entry and forcible detainer. What Constitutes a Forcible Detainer.—If the entry was unlawful and the detainer was forcible, the defendant is guilty of a forcible detainer, whether he originally obtained possession peaceably or otherwise. Verdict in Unlawful -Entry and Forcible Detainer.—A verdict of guilty of an “unlawful entry and forcible detainer” is proper in form under the second section of the Forcible Entry and Detainer Act of April 2d, 1866. The third section of the Act applies to a different class- of detainers. Deed as Evidence in Unlawful Detainer.—When the grantee of one in possession brings an action of unlawful detainer against an intruder, the deed of Ms grantor is admissible in evidence in his behalf, not as evidence of title, hut as tending to show a transfer of possession. When One is Not Guilty of Unlawful Detainer.—One'who enters peaceably and in good faith under a claim of title, is not liable for an unlawful detainer, even if he resists the entry of the prior possessor. Evidence in Unlawful Detainer.—The defendant, in an action of unlawful detainer, may introduce evidence that before the plaintiff acquired possession he had exercised acts of dominion over the premises, as tending to, show a claim of title in good faith. Error in Excluding Testimony Cured.—If the Court errs in refusing to allow a witness to he examined on certain matters, the error is cured by subsequently allowing the witness to he examined on the same matters. Bebutting Evidence in Unlawful Detainer. — If the defendant, in unlawful detainer, for the purpose of showing that he entered on the demanded premises in good faith under a claim of title, offers in evidence a deed, the plaintiff in rebuttal may introduce a prior deed of the grantor to another person. Testimony in Unlawful Detainer.—In an action of unlawful detainer, a deed executed to the defendant after his entry, is not admissible in evidence for any purpose. Instructions to Jury.—If the Court, in its instruction to the jury, states the law of the whole case fully and fairly, it is not error to reject instructions asked by counsel repeating the law in other language. Appeal from the County Court, City and County of San Francisco. This action was commenced in February, 1869. The premises in dispute are in the City and County of San Francisco, and are described as that certain block of land bounded by De Haro, Alameda, Carolina, and South Channel streets, situated upon what is known as the Potrero Huevo, -and designated upon a certain map on file in the Recorder’s office of said city and county, and marked S.S.W., as Block 169, and so described and known upon the official map of said city and county. This block was two hundred feet by three hundred and fifty, and was divided into lots fifty feet by one hundred, each. Williams built the fence, mentioned 'in the opinion, in June or July, 1866. The alleged ouster of the plaintiffs took place about the 15th of September, 1868. On the trial defendants introduced deeds, one from Pratt to defendant Bowers, and one from Farrington and others to Bowers, to show that the defendants entered in good faith and under a claim of title. The plaintiffs, to rebut this claim'of entry in good faith, introduced a deed from Pratt to Wilson, made prior to Pratt’s deed to Bowers, and a judgment of Compton against Farrington and others, and a sale by execution of the land, and a Sheriff’s deed in pursuance thereof to Compton, made before Farrington’s deed to Bowers. These are the deeds spoken of in the opinion. The plaintiffs recovered judgment in the Court below, and the defendants appealed from the judgment and from an order denying a new trial. The other facts are stated in the opinion. Nathaniel Bennett, for Appellants. The Court erred in admitting the Williams'deed, and also the Dent deed, in evidence. One ground of objection to these deeds was that they were evidence of title only. They furnished no evidence of possession in the plaintiffs. We have already insisted that the mere giving of a deed is not per se any evidence of possession of the grantee, as title maybe transferred without possession being taken by the grantee. Besides, these deeds were objectionable as irrelevant; they proved nothing, they tended to prove nothing material to the case. They were not admissible as evidence of title; for in this action title cannot be proved, as is generally understood, nor was any attempt made to prove that Williams had title; nor were they admissible as evidence tending to prove possession in the plaintiffs, as we have above seen they could have no such tendency, as the transfer of title is no evidence that the grantee succeeded to the actual possession. The plaintiffs never had the actual possession of any part of this block. Williams and the Dents had the possession, if any one had it other than the defendants. The deeds from Williams and the Dents did not have the effect of ' transferring any possession which they may have had or claimed to have, to the plaintiffs. At the most those deeds transferred to the plaintiffs only a right of possession. But the plaintiffs could not acquire actual possession by virtue of those deeds, except by an actual entry upon and taking actual possession of the premises. A fence alone and of itself, without, any other acts of ownership either by building or living upon the premises, or cultivating them or pasturing them, or making some other use of them, does not constitute actual possession. (Polack v. McGrath, 32 Cal. 15; Preston v. Kehoe, 15 id. 315; Owen v. Doty, 27 id. 502; Hoag v. Pierce, 24 id. 187; Mitchell v. Davis, 20 id. 47.) D. W. Douthitt, for Respondents. So long as the land was fenced on three sides with a natural barrier, the bay or mud flats on the other, the possession of plaintiffs was sufficient to maintain this action. If the whole fence had been swept away by the tides or high water, if the plaintiffs did anything after indicating their intention to hold the land, they could maintain this action. We call the special attention of the Court to the case of King v. St. Louis Gas Co., 34 Missouri Reports, 34, which maintains us in this proposition. (Minturn v. Burr, 16 Cal. 109.)\",\n",

Miller, 9 Kas. 390, followed. 1.--Deitrieh v. Lang, 11 Kas., distinguished. Error from Shawnee Superior Court. On November 15,1884, T.A. Harris commenced an action in the district court of Shawnee county in the nature of ejectment, against ¥m. Claflin, for the possession of the east half of the southeast quarter, section 28, township 12, range 14, in Shawnee county, excepting therefrom one acre occupied by School District No. 31. On March 18,1885, the case was transferred by the district court of Shawnee county to the superior court of that county. Trial had May 18, 1885. Judgment rendered September 5, 1885, for defendant. The court made and filed the following conclusions of fact: “1. On the 25th day of July, 1859, Lee M. Clark was the owner in fee of the land in controversy in this suit, viz.: The east half of the southeast quarter of section twenty-eight, town twelve, range fourteen east, in the county of Shawnee; and on said day said Clark made, executed and delivered to John W. Brown a mortgage on said premises, to secure the payment of twenty-five dollars in six months from the date of said mortgage, with interest at the rate of five per cent, per month until paid; and said mortgage was, on the 31st day of August, 1859, duly recorded in the register’s office of Shawnee county, in volume 3, on page 47 of the records of deeds. “ 2. On the 20th day of May, 1861, John W. Brown assigned and transferred said mortgage to Nathan P. Case, and on the 5th day of June, 1861, Case, as the owner and holder of the mortgage, commenced a suit against Clark iu the district court of Shawnee county, to foreclose said mortgage. “3. At .the time of the commencement of said foreclosure suit, Lee M. Clark was, and for several years thereafter he continued to be, a non-resident of the state of Kansas. “4. Process of summons was duly issued from said court against Lee M. Clark on the 5th day of June, 1861, directed to the sheriff of Shawnee county to execute, returnable according to law, and it appears by the return of the sheriff on said summons that Lee M. Clark could not be found in said county. “5. On the 5th day of June, 1861, an affidavit was made and filed in said suit, in the words and figures following: “ ‘ The State oe Kansas, County oe Shawnee, ss. — In the Third Judicial District, Shawnee County, Kas., October Term, 1861. — Nathan P.

Case, showing on its face a ■cause of action in favor of him, the said Nathan P. Case, against Lee M. Clark, for the foreclosure of said mortgage. “9. On the 14th day of October, 1861, a judgment or decree was entered by the court in said cause, in the words and figures following; “‘Nathan P. Oabe v. LeeM. Ghaek. — And now comes the said Nathan P. Case, by A. H. Case his attorney; and the said Lee 3M. Clark still failing to demur or answer to the said petition, it is considered that the plaintiff ought to recover the amount due him by reason of the premises, and the court with the consent of the plaintiff finds that there is ■due from the defendant to the plaintiff on the mortgage set forth in said petition the sum of §63.84. It is therefore considered by the court here that the plaintiff recover of the defendant the sum of $63.84, the sum so found due as aforesaid, as also his costs, taxed at $-. And it is considered and adjudged that in case the defendant fails for ninety days from the closing of this term of court to pay the plaintiff the sum of §63.84, so as aforesaid found due, with costs of suit, that an order issue to the sheriff of said county, commanding him to cause the said lands and tenements in the petition described, to wit, the east half of the southeast quarter of section twenty-eight, township twelve, range fourteen east, in the state of Kansas, to be appraised, advertised and sold according to law, and apply the proceeds of said sale in satisfaction of said judgment as aforesaid rendered. And it is further ordered and adjudged, that the defendant be and he is hereby forever barred of all rights of equity of redemption in and to said mortgaged premises.’ “10. In pursuance of said decree, an order of sale was issued for the sale of said land, and the same was appraised and advertised, and on the 22d day of May, 1862, sold at public sale by the sheriff of said county, to Nathan P. Case and A. H. Case, for the sum of $84, and on the 29th day of May, 1862, said sale was confirmed by the order and judgment of said court, and the sheriff was ordered to make and execute a deed of said land to purchasers, Nathan P.

Case and A. H. Case, which deed was afterward, on the 20th day of June, 1862, recorded in the office of the register of deeds of said county, in vol. 6, on page 483 of the records of deeds, and said deed was in due form of law. “12. At the time of said sheriff's sale, in 1862, said land was vacant and unimproved, and not in fact worth any more in cash than the amount at which it was appraised prior to said sale, to wit, $125. “13. At the time of the commencement of this present suit in 1884, said land was worth $10 per acre. “14. On the 26th day of February, 1863, Nathan P. Case and his wife executed and delivered to the defendant William Claflin a warranty deed of the undivided one-half of said land, which deed was on the day it bears date filed for record and recorded in vol. 7, on page 171, in the register’s office of Shawnee county. “15.

The defendant, William Claflin, under claim of ownership by purchase as aforesaid, in good faith paid all the taxes on said land each year from 1866 to 1883, both inclusive. Lee M. Clark paid all the taxes assessed on said land prior to and including those assessed for the year 1865. “17. D. S. Skinner, a resident of Topeka, Kansas, acted as the agent of William Claflin in the payment of said taxes, and on one occasion negotiated, as such agent, a sale of one acre of said land for a school-house site, and in pursuance of such negotiation and sale, Claflin and wife, on the 1st day of July, 1882, executed and delivered to School District No. 31, a warranty deed of one square acre of said land, properly described in said deed, which deed was filed and recorded in the register’s office of Shawnee county, in vol. 86, on page 143, on the 14th day of October, 1882. “ 18. Claflin was never in the state of Kansas, and he resides in Boston, Massachusetts. “19. Lee M. Clark returned to this state in the year 1873, and located in Atchison county, and has continued to reside there ever since. “20. Lee M. Clark never took actual possession of said land, and did not look after it or pay any attention to it in any way, except to remit money to pay taxes, to and including the year 1865, from the time of said foreclosure suit up to August, 1884, when he was called upon by H. H. Harris, the husband and agent of the plaintiff, and then for the first time learned of said foreclosure proceedings. Previous to August, 1884, Clark had no actual knowledge of the foreclosure of said mortgage, except so far as said public records impart knowledge. “21. H. H. Harris, attorney for plaintiff in this suit, is the husband of plaintiff, and the owner of a tract of land adjoining the land in controversy on the west. In April or May, 1884, plaintiff went with her husband to see his land, and passed over the land in controversy in this suit; and she then expressed a desire to become the owner in her own name of the land in controversy, and authorized her husband to ascertain who owned the land and to buy it for her. Prior to that time H. H. Harris, the husband of the plaintiffj had made an examination of the public records of Shawnee county to find who was the owner of the land in controversy, and in his search saw and examined all the deeds and foreclosure proceedings and tax records showing the payments of taxes by defendant, as recited in the above proceedings; and thereafter, that is, after plaintiff’s request as above stated, by correspondence and inquiries learned the place of residence of Lee M. Clark, and went to see him in August, 1884, and purchased said land of him for the sum of $50, which sum he then paid to Clark out of his own money, and took a quitclaim deed for said land from Lee M. Clark and Nancy B. Clark, his wife, to T. A. Harris, plaintiff herein, bearing date August 28,1884, and which was, on the 30th of said August, duly recorded in vol. 94 of deeds, on page 378, in the register’s office of Shawnee county. “22. On the 30th day of August, 1884, H. H. Harris, as agent of the plaintiff, went upon said land and put two signs on posts, one near the south end near a road and one near the east side near a road, each of said signs reading as follows : ‘Keep off this land. — T. A. Harris, owner.’ “23. H. H. Harris also on 30th of August, 1884, as agent of plaintiff, employed one Noah Hackley to plow a hedge row of from four to six furrows ou the east, north and south sides of said land, leaving a space of about two rods on the edge of said three sides for public roads, and Haekley, in pursuance of such employment, did, on the first day of September, 1884, plow some four or five furrows on the three sides of said land, about two rods in from the out edge of said three sides, except at the southeast corner of said land, where there is a draw or sag in said land, there were no furrows plowed for about twenty rods, both on east and south sides. There was a public traveled road on three sides of said land, and in some places on the north and east sides said road turned for several rods onto said land, and then back to the edge, or near the edge, and in plowing furrows around said laud, as aforesaid, said road was crossed several times on the north and east sides of said land, and no plowing was done over or across said road, and said road continued to be traveled without interruption by reason of such plowing. H. H. .Harris owned the adjoining tract of land on the west, and there was no fence between said two tracts, except the one built by defendant, in■closing said land as aforesaid. “24. In September, 1884, and before said land was fenced by defendant, H. H. Harris told D. S. Skinner, of Topeka, as the agent of defendant, that he (Harris) was in possession of .said land, having had some plowing done on it. “25. In the latter part of October, 1884, a post and barbed-wire fence was built by defendant around said land, which fence was set in about two rods from the north, east and south sides of said land, and was set some of the way in the furrows that had been plowed by Haekley, as aforesaid, and it was built across the traveled road on three sides wherever said road bent in on said land beyond said strips of two rods on the out edge, and said fence was built by defendant on three sides as aforesaid, and on the line, on the west side, and was sufficient to turn stock and prevent public travel over said land, except oh the roadway or strips left on said three sides thereof. Said fence was built by defendant so as to not include said school acre. Haekley informed the agent of defendant who built said fence, that lawyer Harris, of Topeka, had had said furrows plowed around said land on three sides n3 aforesaid; at same time said Welch offered to pay Haekley for doing said plowing, and Haekley refused to accept. “26. At the time H. H. Harris purchased said land from <Ciark, as aforesaid, he knew that D. S. Skinner, of Topeka, was the agent of the defendant, and knew that Skinner had been acting for several years as the agent of defendant, and frequently met Skinner in Topeka, but made no inquiries of him as to the extent of his agency, or of the claims of defendant to said land.' “27. Lee M. Clark testified in his deposition, filed in this cause, that he had always claimed an interest in the land up to the time he executed the deed to plaintiff. “28. The defendant did not have the consent of the plaintiff to take possession of said land, or to build said fence thereon. “29. Plaintiff offered on the trial that the court might find the amount of taxes paid on land in controversy by defendant, with interest thereon at seven per cent, until the time of judgment herein, and if the amount should not be paid in sixty days from the date of judgment, said land should be sold therefor.” And thereon the court made and filed the following conclusions of law: “1. Lee M. Clark did not by any act or deed claim or show any interest in the land in controversy after he paid the taxes assessed thereon for the year 1865, until he executed to the plaintiff in August, 1884, the deed under which .plaintiff claims title in this suit. “ 2. The acts and proceedings on the part of plaintiff respecting said land did not constitute possession thereof. “ 3. Said land, except the one-acre tract sold and conveyed to the school district by the defendant, was vacant and unoccupied, and wholly unimproved until defendant Claflin took actual possession thereof by inclosing it with the fence described in the twenty-fifth finding of fact. “4. The plaintiff is not entitled to recover in this action.” Upon the foregoing findings of fact and conclusions of law, the court adjudged that the plaintiff take nothing by her petition herein, and that the defendant -recover of and from the plaintiff his costs herein. New trial denied. The plaintiff brings the case here. H H. Harris, for plaintiff in error. Welch, Lawrence & Welch, for defendant in error.\",\n",

       "  'case_summary': \"Ebenezer L. Ferry and William H. Akin v. Johanna Laible and others. 1. When the creator of a power prescribes the method of its execution, that method must be strictly pursued, so far, at least, as may be necessary to give effect to the creator’s purpose. 2. A power to sell lands does not authorize the making of a mortgage. 3. Where a testator directs his executors to continue his business, and they incur debts in its prosecution, so much and no more of his assets as he has directed should be embarked in business, will stand charged in equity for the payment of the debts of the business. 4. Creditors have a right in the first instance, without first exhausting their remedy against the executors personally, to have recourse to the trade property. 5. In determining what part of his estate he intended so to embark, everything should be understood to have been included, which is reasonably and fairly necessary to the full accomplishment of the testator’s scheme. 6. A testator, by a direction to continue his business, creates a trust estate which the court will keep separate and apply exclusively to the purposes of the trust. 7. If executors, carrying on business pursuant to the direction of the will of their testator, misappropriate the trade assets in the erection of buildings on lands of the testator not embarked in the business, a court of equity may, according to established methods of procedure, compel restitution of such assets, either by directing payment or a sale of the land. Note.—An executor, as such, has no power to mortgage the lands of his testator (Ford v. Bussell, Freem. (Miss.) Ch. 1$); nor an administrator (Green v. Sargeant, 83 Vt. 466); nor a substituted trustee (Tyson v. Latrobe, 48 Md. 386; Belote v. White, 8 Head 703); nor can an executor take lands in payment of debts due to his testator (Allen v. Tie Witt, 3 N. Y. 876; Weir v. Humphries, 4 Ired. Eq. 864; nor convey lands to pay testator’s debts (Bussell v. Bussell, 36 N. Y. 681; see Goode v. Comfort, 39 Mo. 313 ; Close v. Van Husen, 19 Barb. 606); nor is mortgaging the natural way of paying debts (Andrew v. Wrigley, 4 Bro. C. C. 138). In the following cases a power to sell land has been held to include the power to mortgage: Earl of Oxford v. Earl of Albermarle, 16 Jur. 811, on a trust “ to sell and dispose of all and singular, the same hereditaments and premises, either together or in parcels, and either at public auction or by private contract,” and to invest the surplus, after paying encumbrances. On final hearing on bill, cross-bill, answers and proofs. Mr. A. Q. Keasbey, for complainants. Mr. T. N. McCarter, for the executrix of John Laible Jr., deceased. Mr. William H. Morrow, for August Stengel and others, defendants. Duval's Appeal, 88 Pa. St. 112, a devise of a residue of lands to be sold at public or private sale, the proceeds to be applied to the payment of debts not otherwise provided for, and the surplus to be divided among testator’s children, authorizes a conveyance to the executrix to enable her to mortgage the property conveyed, in order to raise money to pay debts. Britton v. Lewis, 8 Pick. Eq. 271, “ to sell all my visible property in such manner as they (the executors) shall think most advantageous ; out of the proceeds I wish my debts to be paid, and the rest I give to my children.”—Held, to authorize a sale and the taking of a mortgage for the entire purchase-money. Also, Sollee v. Croft, 7 Rich. Eq. 84. Bogert v. Hertill, 4 Hill 432, “ for the more easy and equal division of my estate, I do hereby fully authorize and empower my executors hereinafter named, whenever they shall think it expedient, to sell and dispose of all or any part of my real estate for the most moneys that can be gotten for the same, &c.”—Held, that a sale of part of the lands and taking a bond and mortgage for the purchase-money, was valid, and also one executor’s assignment of the mortgage.

       "  'case_summary': \"The Board of Supervisors of the County of Kent v. The City of Grand Rapids, George E. Pantlind, Et Al. [Two Cases.] Equity — Bill to declareright of county to parcel of land once used for county-seat purposes— Where controlled by city in which situated, under claim of right in the city, for thirty years, bill was dismissed — Dedication of land for county-seat purposes — Removal of county-seat therefrom, and sale of court-house to owner.of fee, divest county of all claim to the land —Title of county under dedication not beneficial except for county purposes — Fee ancillary to the trust created — If land conveyed by unlimited grant, adverse possession for thirty years by city renders application of county for equitable relief rather late. 1. Where a city has had peaceable control for over thirty years of a parcel of land once claimed by a county for county-seat purposes, such con trol being under claim of right in the city, and not simply to give police protection to said land as public grounds, a bill in equity by the couuty to declare its right to the land under its original claim is filed too late, and will be dismissed. 2. A parcel of land was dedicated to a county for county-seat purposes, a court-house erected thereon and used for some years by the county, when the county-seat was removed from the land, and the county sold the court-house to the owner of the fee, abandoning all control of the site. Held, that the title in the county under the dedication was not beneficial, except so far as the purposes were county purposes; that the fee was ancillary to the trust, and could give no further proprietary right. Held, further, that on the removal of the county-seat from the land, and the recognition of such removal by the county by the sale of its court-house to the owner of the fee, it lost all interest in the land, and ceased to have any proprietary rights under the dedication. Held, further, that had the land been conveyed to the county by unlimited grant, it would have remained county property until in some way transferred, but that even in such a case, after nearly thirty years’ adverse possession and claim (see head-note 1), it would be rather late for the county to ask for equitable relief. Appeal from Kent. (Montgomery, J.) Argued April 19, 1886. Decided April 29, 1886. Bill filed to determine complainant’s right to an alleged eonrt-house square. Defendants appeal. Decrees reversed and bills dismissed. Tlie facts are stated in the opinions.’ [The importance of these cases and of the principles involved seems to call for full extracts from the briefs of counsel, which are given below. — Reporter.] Isaac M. Turner and M. J. Smiley, for complainant: 1. A bill in equity is the proper remedy in this case. a — Because the complainant was in actual possession at the-time of beginning the suit, and might maintain such a bill to quiet its title and establish its equitable right in the property, under IIow. Stat. § 6626. b — But independent of the statute the present bill may be maintained. All equitable remedies relating to the title to- land, existing before tlie statute, are still in force and available independently of it, and irrespective of tlie question of possession: Ormsby v. Barr, 22 Mich. 85. Although the bill contains the requisite allegations for a bill to quiet title, the suit is really one to establish the complainant’s right to use the land for public purposes, and the question of possession is unimportant: Jones v. Smith, 22 Mich. 365; Village of Mankato v. Willard, 13 Minn. 28. Where a party has an equitable cause of action against another, coming within any recognized rule of equitable jurisdiction, such right can be enforced in equity whether complainant is in possession or not. No statute was needed to enable any one to sue in equity upon an equitable cause of action, and in such case possession is not important, and has never been required: King v. Carpenter, 37 Mich. 366; Geney v. Maynard, 44 Id. 580. According to the complainant’s theory, an action of ejectment could not be maintained, because it alleges and claims that it is already in possession, and that whatever seeming or actual possession the city has, or has had, was not adverse, but consistent with the right claimed in the bill by the complainant. See Mankato v. Willard, 13 Minn. 28. The ownership of the fee by the defendants is not inconsistent with the right claimed by the complainant, and is not in dispute, nor is the right of possession, except for the purposes of the public claimed in the bill. The necessity of a resort to equity arises from the nature of the controversy. It is claimed in the bill that the land in controversy has been dedicated to a public use according to the rules of the common law; and in such case it is weil settled that the fee does not pass, but the right to use for the public purpose does. See Washb. Eas. & Ser. p. 155. Both parties claim to be in possession, which claims arise from a public use of the property. The complainant claims that the said use is consistent with its rights, and the defendants claim it is inconsistent.' The complainant desires to appropriate the property to the particular public use intended by the dedication, by erecting extensive and costly buildings upon it for the use of the county, and it cannot safely proceed to do this while the defendants make claim to the property inconsistent with this right. As has been stated, ejectment will not lie, and equity seems to be the proper jurisdiction in which to have the complainant’s rights ascertained, settled, and decreed. The alleged dedication occurred many years .ago, and the complainant will soon be without witnesses to prove the facts necessary to sustain it. Morgan v. R. R. Co., 96 U. S. 716; Beatty v. Kurtz, 2 Peters, 566; Trustees. etc., v. Cowen, 4 Paige, 510; Commonwealth v. Rush, 14 Penn. St. 186; Hayes v. Livingston, 34 Mich. 395. 2. The property in question was dedicated for court-house purposes. All that is required to make a valid dedication is an offer on the part of the owner of the land, and an acceptance of it on the part of the public: Morgan v. R. R. Co., 99 U. S. 716. Whether the owner intends to make a dedication must be determined from his acts. All that is required is the assent of the owner, and the use of the premises for the purposes intended by the appropriation: Morgan v. R. R. Co., 96 U. S. 723; and dedication may be of a park or public square as well as of a street: Baker v. Johnston, 21 Mich. 319; Cincinnati v. White's Lessee, 6 Peters, 431; White v. Smith, 37 Mich. 291. The ancient plats in use in the public offices, although insufficient to show a statutory dedication, are proper evidence, and tend to show a common-law dedication: Commonwealth v. Alburger, 1 Wharton (Penn.) 469; Washb. Eas. & Serv. 203; Barclay v. Howell's Lessee, 6 Pet. 498. 3. Mere non-user is not an abandonment, and after acceptance by the public something more is required to extinguish the public right: Ward v. Ward, 7 Exch. 838. In the case of apublic way or right, no length of time during which it may not have been used will operate of itself to prevent the public from resuming the right if they think proper: 2 Greenl. Ev. § 665; nor are private easements lost by non-user for twenty years, unless the right as well as the possession is interrupted: Id. Mere suspension of the exercise of a right is not sufficient to prove an intention to abandon it, and even where the suspenseis long continued, it is not an abandonment where the party indicates during the period his intention of preserving it-: Washb. Eas. & Serv. p. 544; but there must be abandonment and non-user of such a character and duration as to show an intent to abandon the easement: Washb. Eas. & Serv. p. 551. 4. In cases of dedication, the owner retains the right to use the land in any way compatible with the full enjoyment of the public easement: Abbott v. Mills, 3 Vt. 521; State v. Catlin. Id. 530. In Carter v. Portland, 4 Oregon, 348, it is said : “ As regards the improvement and use of public parks or squares, it is sufficient if they are put to the use to which they are dedicated when the public convenience requires. The dedication having been made, etc., we are not sure it could have been lost by non-user for twenty years, except so far as it was ousted by an adverse use for that period. To say that a dedication made when the site of the town is new would be lost if not followed by immediate or continued use, would deprive the dedication of its intended value. “ The local authorities or the corporate guardians are the ones whose duty it is to improve, adorn, and embellish the property, and they are the judges when the public pleasure demands the use of the lands dedicated. The original owner, though he has the naked fee, has no right whatever to interfere with the premises, except where the use becomes impossible, or where the authorities seek to put the premises to some other use than that to which they were originally dedicated ; then he, as well as other lot-holders, may proceed in equity to enforce the use according to the original dedication.” See, also, Hardy v. Memphis, 10 Heisk. 127, where it was held that misappropriation of the land to purposes not contemplated by a dedication does not work an abandonment or forfeiture, but only entitles the proprietors to tile a bill to enjoin the improper use. On page 136 it is said: “ In' some cases an abandonment of an easement may be presumed or inferred from non-user, but rarely, if ever, unless there has been such a use by the owner of the premises in or over which the easement has beeu enjoyed as to indicate a claim of right which is adverse to the enjoyment of the easement.” In Rowards Exs. v. Portland, 8 B. Monroe, 232, it is held that public ground being dedicated in a town to public use, the right is not lost for want of use, but exists to be used as the public convenience may require; also, that the use by the town and the general public is sufficient to preserve the preexisting right from any presumption of abandonment, or of ouster and loss, by mere constructive possession or claim against it. See, also, 2 Smith’s Leading Cases, 222, notes to Dovaston v. Payne. In Barclay v. Howell's Lessee, 6 Peters, 507, it is held: “ That if ground be dedicated for a particular purpose, and the city authorities appropriate it to an entirely different purpose, it might afford ground for the interference of a court of equity to compel a specific execution of the trust, by restraining the corporation, or by causing a removal of the obstructions; but even in such a case the property dedicated would not revert to the original owner. ■ The use would still remain in the public, limited only by the conditions of the grant.” If buildings are erected on the space dedicated, or grants of part thereof are made by the one who t originally made the dedication, the vested rights of the public are not thereby affected: New Orleans v. U. S., 10 Pet. 662. The city charter has always contained provisions similar to the present one, viz.: “ That the common council shall have the care and supervision of the highways, streets, lands, alleys, parks, and public grounds in said city, and it shall be their duty to give directions for the repairing, preserving, improving, cleaning, and securing of such highways, * '* parks, and public grounds, and to cause the same to be improved,” etc. (title 3, secs. 35,43; title 6..sec. 1); and it is under supposed authority arising from similar provisions that the city has assumed to improve these public grounds, and not under the claim of ownership. The city, in September, 1850, fully acknowledged the occupancy and right of the county, and offered to quitclaim to the commissioners appointed to locate a county-seat for Kent county, all its right to “ the court-house square, and now occupied by said county.” October 6, 1856, the city offered all of its right to the county, for the purpose of locating the court-house thereon ; and it cannot be fairly urged that the action of the city in taking care of the land and keeping it open for a public park has extinguished the public right. J. W. Ransom, for City of Grand Rapids: The bills filed are bills to quiet title, and complainant cannot have the relief asked for, because the county, as appears by the record, is not in the actual and exclusive possession of the premises as averred in the bill, and not in actual possession as required by law: How. Stat. § 6626. (See note, page 173. — Reporter.) The statute authorizes bills of this character only in cases where complainant is in the actual possession of the premises, and can be sustained only on the ground that complainant has no other means of bringing his title into adjudication. The record shows that complainant claims that it has the right to possess this square for the purposes of a county-seat, and to erect county buildings thereon, and this claim can be adjudicated in an action of ejectment; for ejectment is a possessory action simply, and we insist that the nature of the claim of right to possession for the purposes indicated, as disclosed by the testimony, can be shown at law as well as in equity, in an action of ejectment. If the possession sought were a partial possession, or if it were a possession jointly with the defendant city, the remedy at law might be inadequate ; but the possession sought is absolute, exclusive, and unlimited, and because it is to be devoted to a particular use makes it none the less absolute and exclusive. Therefore we insist the remedy at law is perfect. Devaux v. Detroit, Harr. Ch. 98; Blackwood v. Van Vleet, 11 Mich. 255; Moran v. Palmer, 13 Id. 368-78; Tabor v. Cook, 15 Id. 324; Woods v. Monroe, 17 Id. 238-245; King v. Carpenter, 37 Id. 366; M. E. Church v. Clark, 41 Id. 738. The only possession which complainant has had, for over thirty years, was for a few days while its counsel was preparing and filing these bills. At that tim'e it caused a tight board fence to be built around it, for no other purpose than to afford a foundation for the bills; and this was promptly removed as soon as it came to the notice of the city authorities. This action on the part of complainant was a trespass upon the defendant city’s possession. It was a possession, if it may be called such, which was unfairly gained, for no other purpose than to support these bills, and is unavailing for that purpose: Stetson v. Cook, 39 Mich. 754. We submit that the bills in these cases should be dismissed, so far as the defendant city is concerned, with costs, because: 1. The county (through its board of supervisors), after its right to occupy the square had been brought into dispute, having elected to end the controversy by a surrender and abandonment of the same in 1850, and having surrendered and abandoned the same finally at that time, and the city having entered into the possession and control of the same, and fitted the same up as a public park, for general public uses as such, and expended moneys thereon in beautifying it and making it attractive to the public as a public resort, and having possessed, managed, and controlled the same for more than thirty years, — complainant is now estopped from resuming possession thereof. 2. The defendant city has been in the open, peaceable, quiet, and uninterrupted possession of the premises, adverse to complainant, for over thirty years, and therefore has a prescriptive title thereto, and the right of possession thereof, for the uses and purposes of a public park, against complainant and all others. 3. The defendant city has been in possession of the north half of the premises in question for over thirty years by grant', from Louis Campau, the original proprietor thereof, received! from said Campau while he was in the actual possession thereof ; and is entitled to hold the same under said grant, as well as by a dedication thereof, or an offer of dedication, for general public uses by said Campau, if the same was effectual for any public use. 4. Complainant has shown no title to the premises, legal or equitable. 5. It is not shown that any portion of said square was ever dedicated to the uses of complainant, or to the county of Kent, and the dedication, or offer of dedication, if effectual, was for general public uses. 6. There is no evidence that the county seat of the county of Kent was ever located on the premises in question by any lawful authority. 7. The evidence shows without contradiction that the county seat of tlm county was located elsewhere than on the premises in question by competent authority, viz., on land owned by George Kendall, at the southeast corner of Fountain and Barclay streets, in Grand Rapids, in 1850; and it was also located on the west side of Grand river, in 1851, by the act and vote of the board of supervisors. John E. More, for defendant Pantlind : The right to the enjoyment of an easement, whether public or private, may be lost by abandonment. To constitute an abandonment that will destroy the right, there must be an intent to abandon on the part of the owner of the easement. The abandonment may be either active or passive. It is passive when the intent is evidenced only by non-user; it is active when the ceasing to use the easement is accompanied or followed by acts which clearly and unequivocally show an intent to abandon it. A passive abandonment 'for less than twenty years would probably not destroy the right, while an active abandonment for a year might effectually cut it off. In the case at bar, the county ceased to use the easement it now claims at least as early as 1852, and has never resumed the use of it. The non-user continued for a period of over twenty-nine years prior to the filing of the bill, and were there no further evidence of an intent to abandon, the right would be destroyed. Any other rule would be unjust and inequitable. The dedication of the south half of the square, if made, was made for a specific public use, viz, for a court-house. It cannot be presumed that the motives of the proprietors in offering the land were wholly unselfish. They owned a considerable tract of what was then suburban land adjoining the square, the value of which would be enhanced if the offer were accepted and the purpose carried out. It was not an absolute gift, but an offer to convey upon consideration of the performance of the condition attached. The offer impl ies that the proprietors had an interest in the accomplishment of the intended purpose. The purpose of the offer could not be accomplished by an acceptance and temporary use, but only by the continued and permanent use of the land for a courthouse. Has the county performed the condition of the offer, or paid the consideration for the laud ? True, it accepted the offer and built the court-house, but before any of the . expected benefits and advantages which moved the proprietors to make the offer had been realized, and while their adjacent lands were still unoccupied and unimproved, the county abandoned the site, and has never since occupied it. Being so long in default, what right has the county to equitable relief? It will be remembered that the weight of evidence indicates that the court-house stood on the north half of the square, and that the south half was wholly unoccupied, and that immediately after the county ceased to use the square, Oampau, the proprietor of the north half, took possession of it, and held it until he sold it to the city, in 1852, since which time the city has claimed to hold it adversely to the county. Non user so long continued, accompanied by the resumption of possession by the original proprietor, defeats the right to the easement. It has been determined by this Court that if the public fails to accept a dedication within a reasonable time, the right is lost, and the land reverts: Sinclair v. Comstock, Har. Ch. 412-13; Cass Co. v. Banks, 44 Mich. 476; and the same rule should apply to an intentional abandonment. 1 See note, page 173.\",\n",

       "  'case_summary': '[L. A. No. 32. Department One. December 18, 1895.] In the Matter of the Estate of PIERRE CLOS, Deceased. Estates of Deoeased Persons—Accounts of Executor—Necessary Repairs and Improvements.—Although, as a general rule, executors and administrators are not required nor permitted to make permanent improvements upon the property of the estate in their charge, in the way of erecting new buildings and structures; yet that rule does not apply where repairs and improvements are absolutely necessary to keep the premises in good tenantable condition, and the improvements are rendered necessary by the requirements of a city ordinance over which the executrix has no control, and were made in good faith to the increase of the value of the property; and, in such case, the executrix should be allowed for the repairs and improvements upon the real estate belonging to the estate. Id.—Principle of Equity—Reasonable Expenditures by Executor.— Where the estate has received the full benefit of expenditures, which have been reasonably made by an executrix, it is inequitable to hold that the executrix is not entitled to reimbursement; and the acts of an executor or executrix in the administration of the trust are to be adjudged according to the rules and principles of equity. Id.—Permission of Court—Allowance of Account. — Although it is better practice for an executor first to procure the permission of the probate court to make a needed improvement, before proceeding thereto, yet this is not an indispensable condition to the allowance of the demand in the settlement of the executor’s account, where it appears that the expenditures were just and reasonable, and were made in the interest of the estate. Appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County. W. H. Clark, Judge. The facts are stated in the opinion of the court. McKeeby & Appel, and J. Brosseau, for Appellant. The executrix had power to make the improvements in question. The only measure of her duty was to act with fidelity, and with that degree of prudence and diligence which a man of ordinary judgment would be expected to bestow upon his own affairs of a like nature. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1452; Estate of Rose, 80 Cal. 166; Estate of Moore, 96 Cal. 522.) George D. Blake, for Respondent. The allowance or disallowance of expenditures by an executrix without the order or consent of the court, is within the discretion of the court, and will not be reviewed at all unless it is clear that the discretion has been abused, and the burden of proving the necessity of the expenditures is on the executrix.

Opinion filed October 23, 1917 Rehearing denied Dec. 7, 1917. 1. Limitations—when possession will ripen into title under the twenty year statute. For a possession of land to ripen into a title under the twenty year Statute of Limitations the proof must show that the claimant and those under whom he holds possession and claims title have been in the actual, open and continuous possession of the property for twenty years or more prior to the filing of the suit, under a claim of ownership inconsistent with the claim of the holder of the record title. 2. Same—title acquired by adverse possession is available for attack as well as for defense. A title acquired by adverse possession under the twenty year Statute of Limitations may be used as the basis for a bill in equity to remove a cloud, as the bar of the statute in such case is just as available for attack as for defense. 3. Same—what acts are sufficient to show possession of land claimed wider twenty year statute. It is not necessary that land should be enclosed with a fence or that a house should be erected upon it or that it should be reduced to cultivation to constitute possession under the twenty year Statute of Limitations, but such improvements or acts of dominion over the land as will indicate to persons residing in the immediate neighborhood who has the exclusive control and management of the land are sufficient. 4. Same—possession is continuous where grantee succeeds to possession of grantor. If each grantee of land succeeds to the possession of his grantor there is such privity between the occupants that their several possessions are regarded as continuous under the twenty year statute. 5. Same—continuous possession of land cannot be broken by unlawful entry. The continuous possession of one who claims title to land under the twenty year Statute of Limitations cannot be broken in a way not recognized by law. 6. ForcibeE entry and detainer—entry need not be made with actual force to constitute forcible entry and detainer. To constitute forcible entry and detainer under the statute it is not essential that the entry be accompanied by acts of actual force or violence against either person or property, but if one invades the possession of another against the will of the occupant, however quietly he may do so, the entry is forcible in legal contemplation.

       "  'case_summary': '[No. 14667. Department Two. June 11, 1892.] P. A. DE FRIEZE, Respondent, v. ELIZABETH QUINT, Administratrix, etc., Appellant. Deed — Grant of Absolute Title — Estoppel of Grantor—After-acquired Title — Tax Deed. — The grantor of land is estopped by his deed of grant, bargain, and sale to the grantee, purporting to convey an absolute title to the land, from denying that before and at the time of that deed he had such absolute title, and by that deed conveyed it to the grantee; and if any title is thereafter acquired by the grantor through a tax deed, such title inures to the benefit of the grantee alone. Taxation — Void Assessment — Recitals in Certificate and Deed — Omission in Deed. — Where the certificate of a tax sale states that the property was assessed to a person named, “ and to all owners and claimants, known and unknown,” the certificate shows that the property was not lawfully assessed; and where the tax deed omits to recite the latter part of the assessment as recited in the certificate of tax sale, it is void for not reciting the matters recited in the certificate. Id.— Effect of Recitals — Prima Facie Evidence — Disputable Presumption— Variance of Deed from Certificate. — A tax deed reciting a lawful assessment is only prima facie evidence that the property was assessed as required by law, resting upon a disputable presumption that the recital conforms to the certificate of sale; and where the certificate of tax sale shows an unlawful assessment, its introduction in evidence as a foundation for the admission of the deed not only proves that the property was not lawfully assessed, but also that the tax deed, not conforming to the recitals of the certificate, does not contain the recitals required by law. Statute of Limitations—Adverse Possessiqn — Notice to Owner. —In order to set the statute of limitations in motion against the owner of land, the adverse possession thereof must be sufficiently open and notorious to notify an ordinarily prudent owner of its existence, and of its hostile character, unless he is otherwise actually notified of such facts; and to be available against persons dealing with the owner for the land, the occupancy must be of such a character, at least, as should put them upon inquiry as to the title of the occupant. Id. — Burden of Proof. —The burden of proving all the essential elements of an adverse possession, including its hostile character, is upon the party relying upon it. Id.—Possession of Unimproved and Uninclosed Land — Notice of Adverse Possession —• Prescription —■ Quieting Title — Finding against Evidence. — In an action to quiet title to land, where the plaintiff claims title by prescription, claiming adverse possession under a tax deed during five years before the commencement of the action, but the evidence shows that the land was uninclosed and uncultivated, and no person resided upon it; that it was bounded on all sides by uninclosed land, upon which, as well as upon it, the cattle of the neighbors roamed and grazed without restraint, —the fact that the plaintiff, through his lessee, erected upon the land a rude shed, sufficient to afford shelter to “three valuable animals,” is not sufficient, in the absence of express notice, to justify the inference that the defendant had notice of an adverse possession of the plaintiff, especially where there is no evidence that the shed was ever used for any purpose, and will not justify a finding of adverse possession of the land. Appeal from an order of the Superior Court of Marin County, and from an order denying a new trial. The facts are stated in the opinion. W. H. Payson, and Hepburn Wilkins, for Appellant. The purchase under tax sale by De Frieze was fraudulent and void, and De Frieze could not base any adverse claim or possession thereon. There was an implied covenant, from the use of the word “ grant,” in the deed from De Frieze to Quint, that the land was free from all encumbrances made, done, or suffered by the grantor. (Civ. Code, sec. 1113.) It was therefore a fraud on the part of De Frieze to attempt to acquire a tax title to this property upon an assessment for taxes, which, if valid, was a lien at the date of the deed from him to Leander Quint, which it was his duty to pay, and under such circumstances the tax sale to De Frieze was void, and he could claim no right or title thereunder. (Kelsey v. Abbott, 13 Cal. 609; McMinn v. Whelan, 27 Cal. 300; Dolhequy v. Tabor, 22 Cal. 279; Coppinger v. Ford, 23 Cal. 480; Garwood, v. Hastings, 38 Cal. 217; Reiley v. Lancaster, 39 Cal. 354; Christy v. Fisher, 58 Cal. 256.) A tax title procured by fraud is a nullity against the owner. (Shay v. McNamara, 54 Cal. 169.) Where a conveyance purporting to grant the property in fee-simple is made, all subsequently acquired title passes to the grantee. (Civ. Code, sec. 1106; Clark v. Baker, 14 Cal. 630; 76 Am. Dec. 449; Dalton v. Hamilton, 50 Cal. 422; Klumpke v. Baker, 68 Cal. 561.) De Frieze, having no possession by inclosure or cultivation, and no color of title, has failed to show the possession required by the statute of limitations. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 325.) Adverse possession founded upon a written instrument must be asserted in good faith with the bona fide belief that the claimant has the title. (Walsh v. Hill, 38 Cal. 488; Cannon v. Union Land Co., 38 Cal. 672; McCracken v. San Francisco, 16 Cal. 594-636; Nieto v. Carpenter, 21 Cal. 490; Wilson v. Atkinson, 77 Cal. 492; 11 Am. St. Rep. 299; Silvarer v. Hansen, 77 Cal. 582.) The tax sale was void on its face. The assessment was to John De Frieze, and all owners, known and unknown, and this renders the deed void. (Grotefend v. Ultz, 53 Cal. 666; Daly v. Ah Goon, 64 Cal. 512.) No claim of title can be asserted under an instrument which is void on its face. (Nieto v. Carpenter, 21 Cal. 490.) Adverse possession, to be available, must be continued for the full period prescribed by the statute; and if it was interrupted, it is not available. (City of San José v. Trimble, 41 Cal. 536; Trotter v. Cassidy 3 A. K. Marsh. 365; 13 Am. Dec. 183.) If the legal owner of the land enters with intent to reclaim the possession, the adverse possession is thereby terminated. (Note to Trotter v. Cassidy, 13 Am. Dec. 185; Taylor v. Burnsides, 1 Gratt. 165; Tyler on Ejectment, 908, 909; Hood v. Hood, 2 Grant Cas. 229; Johnston v. Fitz George, 50 N. J. L. 470.) When the possession was interrupted, Quint, having the true title, had the constructive possession of the whole tract, and De Frieze had not. De Frieze could not dispute the fact that Quint had the true title, because the grantor is estopped by his deed from denying the title of his grantee. (Dodge v. Walley, 22 Cal. 228; 83 Am. Dec. 61; Belcher Con. M. Co. v. Deferrari, 62 Cal. 162.) Where two parties claim the constructive possession of the same property, and one has the title, as Quint did in this case, and the other has not, the superior title draws to itself constructive possession of the land as against the inferior or invalid title. (Semple v. Cook, 50 Cal. 26.) De Frieze cannot claim title against his own deed without first notifying his grantee that he so claims, or actually ousting him. Possession by a grantor, after he has deeded away the land, must be deemed to be in subordination to the legal title, and will not be presumed to be adverse without proof of ouster, or notice of the claim of title in hostility to the true owner, which would amount to an ouster.. (Jackson v. Burton, 1 Wend. 341; Burhans v. Van Zandt, 7 Barb. 91; Schwallback v. Chicago etc. R’y Co., 73 Wis. 137; 69 Wis. 292; 2 Am. St. Rep. 740; Jay v. Welchel, 78 Ga. 786; Evans v. Templeton, 69 Tex. 375; 5 Am. St. Rep. 71.) The alleged possession of plaintiff was not notice of adverse bolding. The notice and ouster must be actual, to constitute adverse possession against a tenant in common or trustee. (Watson v. Sutro, 86 Cal. 500; In re Grider, 81 Cal. 571.) The alleged possession of De Frieze was insufficient. Allowing cattle to roam over unfenced land is not sufficient to constitute adverse possession. (Wilson v. Corbier, 13 Cal. 166; Buel v. Frazier, 38 Cal. 693; Sepulveda v. Sepulveda, 39 Cal. 18.) The payment of taxes was not a continued notice that adverse possession was being maintained. (Davis v. Perley, 30 Cal. 631.) Even if there was no evidence of De Frieze having been in possession when he sold the property to Judge Quint, the law would presume that he was so in the possession from the fact that the owner of land is presumed to be in the possession thereof unless the contrary is established. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 321; Minturn v. Brower, 24 Cal. 660; Garwood v. Hastings, 38 Cal. 223; Shiels v. Haley, 61 Cal. 157.) George W. Towle, Jr., and McKoon & Towle, for Respondent. What constitutes an adverse possession upon which a title to land may be supported is, in this state, a matter of statute, and the acts constituting a statutory adverse possession must, in the very nature of things, constitute notice in and of themselves. A statutory adverse possession is notice. (See Murray v. Hoyle, 92 Ala. 559; Code Civ. Proc., secs. 323, 325.) When an adverse possession by use for pasturage has once commenced, nothing short of an interruption of such occupancy and use, or the payment of taxes, will stop the running of the statute in favor of such adverse holder. (Civ. Code, sec. 1007. See also note to Trotter v. Cassidy, 13 Am. Dec. 185.) Occasional interruptions of possession during the period necessary to create a title by adverse possession, which do not impair the use to which the occupant subjects the property, and for which it is chiefly valuable, will not necessarily defeat the presumption of a grant. (Fuller v. Fletcher, 44 Fed. Rep. 34.) Quint certainly had notice of the plaintiff’s adverse possession. The payment of taxes, such constituting a necessary element of an adverse possession, was a continued notice to Quint that such possession was being maintained. (Sorber v. Willing, 10 Watts, 142; Bird v. Dennison, 7 Cal. 297, 311.) Quint could not have visited the property subsequent to the first day of September, 1883, without having notice given by the building upon the premises, and the cattle grazing uj>on it, that a use of the premises, adverse in character, was being made. (Unger v. Mooney, 63 Cal. 586, 596; 49 Am. Rep. 100.) If possession has been accompanied by acts indicating an adverse claim of title of so notorious a character as to satisfy a jury that a person ordinarily attentive to his interests would have notice of the adverse claim, a finding of adverse possession will be sustained. (Oglesby v. Hollister, 18 Pac. Rep. 149.) In order for the appellant’s claim that there was an implied covenant from the use of the word “ grant ” in the deed, that the land was free from encumbrances, to have held good he should have shown that the tax was assessed to him. (See Kelsey v. Abbott, 13 Cal. 609, 617.) Payment of taxes accompanied by actual occupancy is equivalent to an actual ouster. (Sorber v. Willing, 10 Watts, 142.) Omission to pay taxes for statutory period is a confession of ouster. {Royer v. Benlow, 10 Serg. & R. 306.) The deed being fair on its face, the record showing it to be valid, possession under it from its date will be presumed. (2 Desty on Taxation, 1009.) A tax deed vests absolute title to the interest and estate of the original owner. (2 Desty on Taxation, p. 966, sec. 150.) A tax deed, although not fair on its face, in fact void, is. color of title.

Adverse Possession — Evidence.—Action to recover land claimed by plaintiff on the ground of adverse possession. Evidence reviewed and held sufficient to sustain a verdict in favor of defendant.

Idem — Boundary Line — Mistake.—If a party occupies land up to a fence which he believes to be on the boundary line of his land, but having no intention to claim up to the fence if it should be beyond the line, an indispensable element of adverse possession is wanting.

Verdict was directed for the plaintiff. Exception was taken to the direction, and defendant asked to go to the jury, first, upon the ground of adverse possession, and upon several other grounds. Refusals were made and exceptions taken. Judgment was entered for the plaintiff in accordance with the verdict directed. Appeal by the defendant, the case returning all the material evidence.

       "  'case_summary': \"Rebecca Wheeler, Respondent, v. St. Joseph Stock Yards & Terminal Company, Appellant. Kansas City Court of Appeals, April 10, 1896. 1. Negligence: ingredients. The ingredients of actionable negligence are, the existence of a duty to the injured party, the failure to perform that duty, and the resulting injury. 2. License: revocation: burden of proof. Where the owner relies upon the fact of the revocation of a license, the burden is on him to show it. 3. Negligence: license: revocation. The inclosure of outlying land with a lawful fence will ordinarily be sufficient to revoke the public’s license to travel thereover. But where one undertakes to inclose his property under circumstances that render it dangerous for those likely to pass over it, it becomes his duty to give some sort of warning thereof; and this is the case if it appear that the obstruction is placed so as to keep the licensee from entering the premises. 4. -:-: -: notice. A landowner who puts up a sufficient barricade to prevent people passing over his land has sufficiently discharged his duty, and will not be liable for removal of such barricade, unless he has sufficient notice thereof to prevent the injury complained of. 5. -: -: -: cause of injury. The evidence in this ease was sufficient to justify the jury in finding defendant’s removal of a plank in a bridge floor the cause of plaintiff’s injury. 6. -: -: -: barricade: instruction. When licensor revokes a license to the public to travel over his uninclosed lands by removing a bridge floor, he should maintain a barricade for such time as would be reasonable to notify the public of the condition of the bridge; and an instruction to that effect is proper. 7. -: agent: servant. The knowledge of an agent of the removal of a barrier which it was his duty to construct, is knowledge of the principal; but the knowledge of an employee or servant is not notice to the defendant, and an instruction with regard to notice in this case is erroneous but harmless. ON MOTION FOR REHEARING. 8. Principal and Agent: knowledge of agent: notice to principal. The rule imputing knowledge of the agent to the principal is confined to knowledge acquired by the agent at the time he is discharging the duties of his agency. ■£>. -: -: -: master and servant: definitions. The line of demarcation between principal and agent and that of master and servant is exceedingly difficult to define, the essential difference being in degree rather than in kind. The term employee has no greater signification than that of servant. 10. License: revocation: notice: trespasser. Placing a barbed wire fence on the south side of uninelosed land over which the public had acquired a license to travel may not per se be notice of the revocation of a license to use a bridge on the north side of the tract when there are other ways leading over the land from the bridge, than the one fenced; and one may not lay a trap for even a trespasser. Appeal from the Buchanan Circuit Court. — Hon. A. M. Woodson, Judge. Affirmed. Brown <& Pratt for appellant. (1) The evidence shows that the plaintiff’s husband, John A. Wheeler, was a trespasser with notice’of the withdrawal by defendant of its license to use the road; therefore, defendant owed him no duty. (2) Because the evidence, which was not contradicted, and was conclusive upon the question of fact, showed the defendant built a sufficient barricade. This was the limit of defendant’s duty to all” travelers along the ' road, whether licensees or trespassers. (3) Defendant was not bound to maintain a barricade. If it built a sufficient one, it fulfilled its duty to all travelers, whether licensees or trespassers. (4) There was absolutely no testimony tending to show notice upon the part of defendant or any of its servants, that the barricade had been torn down. B,atte v. Dawson, 52 N. W. Rep.

James W. Boyd for respondent. (1)' The appellant’s demurrer to the evidence was-properly overruled. The evidence not only makes a. case, but makes a strong case, for respondent. This-road had been used for years. The -part of the road which appellant claims was on its land, was of course used as extensively as the parts north and south of it, which were parts of the old highway. The evidence fully sustains the case. The appellant is liable. Morrow v. Sweeny, 38 N. E. Rep. 187; Carscaddon v. Mills, 31 N. E. Rep. -559; Phillips v. Library Co., 27 Mo. App. 478.

App. 255; Glech v. Railroad, 57 Mo. App. 259; Franke v. City, 110 Mo. 516, and cases cited. (2) If the appellant put a barricade across the road, as its witnesses say, still', according to the testimony of appellant’s own witness, it was removed in a very short time. Appellant knew of its removal; knew it had not remained long enough to be any notice-to the people, and the question of appellant’s knowledge of its removal was, on motion of appellant, submitted to the jury. The appellant induced the court to adopt the theory, at the trial, that if the barricade was placed and removed, respondent could not recover unless appellant had notice of its removal; that is, that, under such circumstances mentioned in its instruction 5, respondent could recover if “defendant had notice of such removal.” Appellant can not now in fairness, repudiate the theory which it induced the circuit court to adopt at the trial.

       "  'case_summary': 'SCOTT v. BAIRD. 1. Boundaries — Practical Location — Agreement and Acquiescence of Parties — Evidence—Question for Jury. In ejectment depending on the location of the center line of a certain lot, evidence examined, and held, that whether the owners of the lot and the one adjoining had not fixed the boundary between them by mutual agreement and acquiescence was a question for the jury. 2. Tenancy in Common — Rights of Co-Tenants — Purchases — Inurement to Co-Tenants. Where a tenant in common of a city lot purchases from the owner of the adjoining lot a strip of land on which a wall is built parallel to, but some distance from, the boundary of the lots as shown by the plat, together with the. right to use the wall as a party wall, any right he acquires to use the space intervening between the boundary of the lots and the wall inures to his co-tenants. 3. Boundaries — Practical Location — Tenants in Common — Estoppel. In ejectment depending on the location \\'of the center line of a certain lot, formerly owned in common by the parties and voluntarily partitioned by them by deeds reciting the center line as the dividing line, evidence examined, and held, that whether defendant was estopped to deny that the walls standing on either side of the land were party walls and marked the boundaries of the lot was a question for the jury. 4. Same — Evidence—Admissibility. Plaintiffs having acquired their title at a public sale at which defendant was present, evidence that the officer making the sale stated that he was selling an undivided half of the land between the walls, and that defendant, made no objection, was admissible. Carpenter, C. J., and Grant and Hooker, JJ., dissenting. Error to Ingham; Wiest, J. Submitted October 12, 1905. (Docket No. 43.) Decided July 23, 1906. Ejectment by Ira Scott and William O’Connor against James J. Baird. There was judgment for defendant on a verdict directed by the court, and plaintiffs bring error. Never sed. This is an action of ejectment to recover a strip of land 6 inches wide and 157 feet long from the south side of the north half of lot 4, block 83, of the city of Lansing. Orlando F. Barnes, the owner of the entire lot, on August 19, 1889, deeded an undivided one-half to defendant Baird, and the other undivided one-half to Nelson Bradley. On September 27, 1900, plaintiffs became the owners of Bradley’s interest at a public sale of the assets, of the People’s Savings Bank. On June 3, 1903, plaintiffs and defendant made a partition of this lot, defendant taking the south half and plaintiffs the north half thereof. These deeds recited an agreement: “That the center line of said lot, running east and west, may at any time hereafter be used for a partition wall by either party, their heirs or assigns; said line to be the center of said wall,” etc. There were brick stores on the north and south of this lot; the lot being vacant except as to a small wooden structure upon the south half. Defendant Baird employed a surveyor and located the center line of the lot in accordance with the original plat of the town of Michigan, afterwards the city of Lansing. In making this survey and in locating the center line the surveyor adopted the original monuments. The town of Michigan was platted in 1847. This plat included section 16 on which lot 4 is located. The specifications attached to the plat of the town of Michigan, made in 1847, provided that: “The point from which all measurements are to be made upon section 16 is designated by a cross cut in the end of a stone planted one foot below the surface of the ground on the west line of Washington avenue in the center of Michigan avenue,” and “the landmarks which govern the survey and plat of this town are two stones planted one foot below the surface of the ground upon the west line of Washington avenue, one of which is in the center of St. Joseph street, and the other in the center of Saginaw street.” Block 83 lies between Ionia and Shiawassee streets and is bounded on the east by Washington avenue, it is the third block north of the intersection of Washington and Michigan avenues. There are six lots in the block fronting on Washington avenue, numbered from 1 to 6, from Shiawassee to Ionia streets; lot 6 being bounded on the south by Ionia street and on the east by Washington avenue. The brick store building on the north of lot 4 was erected in 1885 by Barker and Parker, and is known as the “Barker Block.” The brick building south of lot 4 was erected by one Hinchey in 1891. In 1879 he built two stores on the south part of lot 5. In 1859 one Ephraim Longyear erected a brick building on the south one-third of lot 6. The land at that time was comparatively unsettled, the streets had been laid out, but had not been graded. Ionia street had been cut out through the woods six blocks west of Washington avenue. Washington avenue between Ionia street and Michigan avenue had not been graded, but was opened and some business houses erected along it. The county surveyor, named Preston, was employed by Mr. Longyear to establish the lines for the building to be erected by him. In fact, the south line of that building encroaches upon Ionia street about 15 inches. It has been occupied as a business block since its erection, and no change has been made in its location. All the store buildings erected on lots 5 and 6 — and both lots are covered with buildings — are located too far south, and their lines were evidently located with reference to the south line of the Longyear or Buck building. When Mr. Hinchey erected his buildings on lot 5 in 1879, he took the southeast corner of the Longyear building, now the Buck building, as the starting point, and when, in 1891, he erected his north building, his north wall was placed entirely upon his own lot, and a few inches south of the south line of lot 4, according to the original plat and monuments. After Barker and Parker had erected their building on the north of lot 4, they discovered that they had encroached upon lot 4 about 15 inches. On November 15, 1893, defendant, Nelson Bradley, Orlando P. Barnes, and their wives executed á deed to Mr. Barker, the then owner of the Barker Block, of— . “The undivided one-half interest in and to a strip of land described as follows, to wit, the north 15 inches of lot 4, block 83, city of Lansing, Michigan, except west eight feet which has heretofore been deeded to the city of Lansing for alley purposes. This deed is given to establish the wall line between the lands of the parties hereto, and particularly the south wall of the brick block known as the ‘Barker and Parker Block,’ occupying the east 90 feet of the above-described premises, and to vest in each of the parties hereto, their heirs and assigns, the said wall and land.” Then followed certain provisions in regard to the use of the wall and land in case of destruction. It contained also the further provision: “It is understood and agreed that the parties of the first part, from and after the execution of this deed, are the owners of an undivided one-half of the wall now upon the land in the deed described, and entitled to the use thereof.” That deed was in the abstract of title, and was known to the plaintiffs. In 1903 Mrs. Hinchey and\\'her children, Mr. Hinchey having died, gave a deed to defendant Baird containing the following description: “ Commencing at a point on the west line of Washington avenue 131 feet and 6 inches north of the north line of Ionia street, as now marked by the face of the south wall of Buck’s furniture store, running thence west in center of wall 80 feet, thence north 6 inches, thence east on the north side of wall 80 feet to Washington avenue, thence south six inches to place of beginning. This deed is given to establish and confirm a party wall, as now located on the lands described. If in future either of joint owners wishes to extend the wall to the west on same line and shall pay more than one-half of the total cost thereof the owner not building shall before using such wall so extended pay to the other the one-half part of the total cost of it.” In making the partition, defendant paid plaintiffs $75. The parties disagree as to the reason for this payment. The reason, however, we think immaterial. In directing a verdict, the circuit judge concisely stated his reasons therefor, as follows: “ The town of Michigan, now the city of Lansing, was established by the State commissioners in the year 1847. The school section was platted by this authority. Block 83 commences two blocks north of the center of section 16. For the purpose of making certain the courses, lines, and distances controlling the plat of the new town, certain permanent monuments or measuring points were fixed, and the three with which we are concerned were fixed, respectively, one in the center of Michigan avenue, on the west line of Washington avenue; one in the center of Saginaw street, on the west line of Washington avenue, and one in the center of St. Joseph street, on the west line of Washington avenue. . These, being the original starting points of the surveys establishing lots and blocks, must control now, as they did then, unless their location is uncertain or long practical location of lots or common acquiesence has made some other place or point the thing that should control, for the reason that, in fact, it has been considered and acted upon as controlling, and therefore has controlled. “When Mr. Longyear endeavored to find the south line of lot 6 of block 83, at the time he started to build in 1859, he alone was interested, and his private want and act in no way changed permanent monuments or affected the other lot owners in the block. Mr. Preston, the county surveyor, in giving him the line, acted in no official capacity so as to bind the other lot owners, and could not legally change or modify the true distance from the original monument. Nothing but long acquiescence in the line so established by all affected thereby could authorize the adoption of such lines. * * * “ Mr. Preston made a mistake and got the line of lot 6 too far south, but that mistake only affected lot 6. Later, the owners of lot 5 appear to have acquiesced in the location of lot 6, but the owners of lot 4 have never precluded themselves from denying that the location of lots 5 and 6 located lot 4 according to the same mistake. The owners of lot 4 were not concerned with the location of lots 5 and 6, for the reason that their location did not encroach upon lot 4. When the owners of lot 3 located their lines substantially in accordance with the mistaken ones of lot 5 and 6 and encroached upon the lines of lot 4, was the first the owners of lot 4 were called upon to repel the assumption that the Preston survey established true lines, and this was done, and the Preston survey repudiated by the owners of lots 3 and 4, when the owners of lot 4 deeded to the owner of the south one-third of lot 3 the undivided one-half of the north 15 inches of lot 4 for the purposes of a party wall, and for the reason that it was then, or some part of it, was occupied by the wall the owner of lot 3 had erected. The owners of lot 4 have not been shown to have acquiesced in the acts of other lot owners following the Preston- survey, and I am of the opinion that no such acquiescence has been shown in the lines of the Preston survey as makes the lines adopted by \"the owner of lot 6 controlling upon any other lot owner unless, possibly, upon the owner of lot 5. Ever since the establishment of the plat the location and lines of lot 4 could any day have been ascertained and determined to a certainty from the original monument and in the way specified in the plat. Not only this, but the location of lot 4 has for many years been understood. Barker understood he had encroached upon lot 4 with his wall when he purchased a wall easement in 1893. Hinchey understood the Buck line was untrue when he built his north wall upon his own land and told Buck his store was in the street. Buck has known his south line should not control others from the day he learned his building encroached upon the street. Mr. Haze knew it when Thcman built next his line on lot 3 and left a space between his ancient fence and the wall then erected. Mr. Thoman knew it, for he says he knew when he built he was south of the north line of lot 3 some 14 inches. Baird, Barnes, and Bradley knew it when they granted Barker the easement on lot 4 for his encroaching wall. \\' In the face of this knowledge of the Preston mistake, it cannot be said there has been such an acquiescence among the owners of lots in this block as to establish the Buck building the testing point from which to run lines and measure distances. The Buck line was a. mistake, and has been recognized as such for years, and while it may be the line as between those who have acquiesced in it, it has not become the monument from, which all lots on that side of the block are to be located. “ The monument at Michigan avenue has never been superseded by any other, so far as the proof shows, regarding lot 4 and measurements from it confirmed by the ancient Haze fence and other points in evidence show that defendant has not built the center of his wall north of the east and west center line of lot 4.” Thomas, Cummins & Nichols, for appellants.

       "  'case_summary': \"THOMAS J. DEE, Appellant, v. JOSEPH NACHBAR. Division Two, December 10, 1907. 1. EJECTMENT: Judgment on Pleadings. Plaintiff is not entitled to judgment on the pleadings on the filing of an answer which in the same count admits plaintiff’s possession within the past ten years but pleads estoppel. Nor if the answer, which in one count seems to admit plaintiff’s possession within ten years, in others iJleads a general denial and limitations. 2. -: Instruction: Principles Embodied in Another. The refusal of an instruction asked by plaintiff in ejectment is not error, if the court, of its own motion, gives a correct instruction covering the theory embraced in the one asked by plaintiff. 3. -: -: Description. An instruction based on a description found in defendant’s answer, which does not follow that description, but brings in land not in dispute, should be refused. 4. -: —i-: No Evidence. An instruction telling the jury that if they “believe from the evidence that defendant never intended to claim any part of the land north of the sewer box as the north side of his dwelling” he cannot set up title thereto by adverse possession, where there is no evidence as to where the “sewer box” was, should be refused, since there is no evidence on which to base it. 5. -: Estoppel: Statement to Defendant’s Grantor. Statements made by plaintiff to defendant’s grantor as to where the stake and true boundary lines were, are just as binding on him as if made to defendant himself, and therefore’ such statements, though not made in defendant’s presence, are admissible in • evidence. 6. -: -: Pointing out True Line: Changing Mind. An instruction which tells the jury that unless they believe that the stake and line, claimed to have been pointed out by plaintiff, “has always since that time been taken and agreed between plaintiff and defendant to be the boundary line of plaintiff’s property,” etc., should be refused. Such an instruction would authorize the jury to find for plaintiff if he at any time thereafter changed his mind as to the true boundary line. The law is that, if the line contended for by defendant was pointed out by plaintiff to defendant or his grantor, as the true line, it is only necessary that defendant’s use or possession of the strip in dispute continue long enough thereafter to indicate what was the understanding of the adjacent owners. 7. -: Misleading Instruction: Designating Dividing Line: Evidence Omitted From Bill. Where appellant admits that the entire evidence is not preserved by the bill of exceptions, the Supreme Court will not undertake to pass upon a question entirely or practically controlled by evidence not before it. So that, where appellant complains that an instruction given for respondent was misleading in that it speaks of “the dividing line,” “the line made by Koehler brothers,” and “the true dividing line,” thus placing, as appellant contends, three lines before the jury, in reply to which respondent insists that the designations refer to • only on'e and the same line, as would clearly appear if all the evidence were before the Supreme Court, and appellant admits the bill of exceptions does not preserve the entire evidence, the .court will not undertake to determine whether or not the instruction was misleading. 8. ——: Instruction: Assumption of Fact. An instruction which assumes as an established fact that the fence therein mentioned “extended from the east end cf the property in question to about the rear of plaintiff’s house,” is not error, where the evidence in favor of the assumed fact was all one way and the fact was in no way controverted. 9. -: Error in Admission and Rejection of Evidence: Harmless. Where the testimony offered on behalf of appellant and ruled out, and that admitted on behalf of respondent over appellant’s objection, was not of such a character as to have changed the result or to authorize a reversal, even if the rulings of the court were wrong, it is unnecessary for the Supreme Court to determine whether or not those rulings were right or wrong. Appeal from Jackson Circuit Court. — Ro». A. F. Evans, Judge. Affirmed. William G. Forsee for appellant. The motion for judgment on the pleadings should have been sustained. Defendant could not, upon his answer, deny that he was in possession when we sued: (a) Because his plea of adverse possession admits the fact of possession. Tatum v. St. Louis, 125 Mo. 647. (b) Because unless the ground described in paragraph two of the answer was part of the land sued for, the plea would have no pertinency whatever to the case. Plaintiff’s suit is for the south three and one-half feet of lot 272; defendant pleads that be is and bas been in possession of tbe land he describes for a period long enough to invest him with title. He does not say in terms that tbe land be describes is tbe ‘‘ south three and one-half feet,” etc., but unless it is tbe same land, be must be deemed to be setting up title to land not in controversy, (c) Because, further, as be admits in paragraph three that tbe land was tbe property of plaintiff in 1894, and as this suit was filed on March 20, 1903, it conclusively appears that be could not have been in adverse possession for the requisite period. His averment is that “tbe stake and line so pointed out by plaintiff [in 1894], as being the correct boundary line between said properties, bas always been taken and agreed to be the south boundary line,” etc. If it was agreed to be tbe line in 1894, then tbe adverse possession did not precede tbe date of the agreement, but could only follow that date. As defendant admits by tbe averments of paragraph three that -plaintiff was in possession in 1894, and as be admits by tbe facts averred that be was in possession at date of suit, it follows that upon tbe face of tbe pleadings plaintiff was entitled to judgment, and bis motion for judgment should have been sustained. The foregoing contention is not weakened by tbe fact that one of tbe defenses pleaded is a general denial. A general denial amounts to nothing as a denial of the fact of possession, when tbe same answer at once proceeds to confess such possession. Price v. Mining C'o., 83 Mo. App. 470; Bank v. Stone, 93 Mo. App-. 292; Darrett v. Donelly, 38 Mo. 494; McCord v. Railroad, 21 Mo. App. 95; Atteberry v. Powell, 29 Mo. 433; Cable v. McDaniel, 33 Mo. 363; Adams v. Trigg, 37 Mo. 143. Stubenrauch S Thurmond for respondent. Appellant’s main contention is, that bis motion for judgment on tbe pleadings should have been sustained. His, whole argument on this point is based on false premises. His first premise is that defendant, by the second paragraph of his answer, admits that defendant was in possession of the land sued for by plaintiff. To this plaintiff adds another false premise, to-wit: That because defendant pleads that in 1894 plaintiff pointed out this same line as the correct boundary line, therefore, defendant and his grantors, could not have been in possession for a period of ten years prior to the bringing of the suit. He clearly overlooks the fact, which even- his meagre record shows, that there was possession by defendant’s grantors prior to 1894, because Yaughn testifies that hé bought the property in question in January, 1894, and that there was an old fence on the line marked by the stake which Yaughn dug up and which Dee said was the correct line. A general denial, the plea of adverse possession, and the plea of estoppel, are three distinct defenses. Brummell v. Harris, 148 Mo.'440. But if the defenses were inconsistent, the remedy would be by motion to strike out, and not by motion for judgment on the pleadings after verdict.\",\n",

Decided July 25, 1892.] fluTiVTTuAT, Pbactice — Filing of information — Motion in arrest of judgment. — A motion in arrest of judgment must rest upon statutory grounds, and therefore, it is not error to deny a motion of that nature made upon the ground that the information on which the defendant was tried was not made and filed within thirty days after the delivery of the complaint to the District Court, as such ground is not enumerated in section 357 of the Criminal Practice Act, prescribing the cause for which a motion in arrest of judgment may be granted. Same — Objection to information — Waiver. — Objection to an information, on the ground that it was not filed within the time allowed by law, should be taken advantage of by the defendant at the time he is required to answer the information, by motion to set it aside, as allowed by sections 205 and 206 of the Criminal Practice Act, as under section 208 of the Criminal Practice Act, if such motion be not made before the defendant demurs or pleads, the ground of objection shall be deemed waived. Same — Information—Time for filing. — Sections 1, 2, pages 248, 249, of the Laws of the Second Session, permit the filing of an information within thirty days after the granting of leave therefor by the court, independent of the time when the examination took place. Same — Arrest of judgment— Objection to information— Waiver. — Where the defendant did not plead to the information until the venue had been changed to another county, his motion in arrest of judgment, upon the ground that the information was not filed in time, was properly denied under section 233 of the Criminal Practice Act, providing that all questions concerning the regularity of proceedings, and the right of the court to which the change is made to try the cause and execute judgment, shall be considered as waived after the trial and verdict. OBmnNAii Law — Evidence— Writings explaining motives. — A written order from the county commissioners to the prosecuting witness, who was a road supervisor, directing Mm to open a road through defendant’s field, of which order defendant had knowledge, is competent evidence to explain the motives and conduct of the witness in cutting defendant’s fence, at the time he was fired upon by the defendant. Same — Assault with intent to murder — Trespass. —A bare trespass against the property of another, not his dwelling-house, is not sufficient provocation to warrant the owner in using a deadly weapon in its defense; and therefore, on the trial of one charged with assault with intent to commit murder, evidence on behalf of defendant tending to show that the proceedings and order of the county commissioners, under which a road supervisor was attempting to open a road tM\\'ough defendant’s field, were void, is properly excluded. Appealfrom Ninth Judicial District, Gallatin Cownty. Conviction for assault with intent to commit murder. Defendant was tried before Armstrong, J. Affirmed. E. P. Cadwell, for Appellant. I. The court below erred in overruling the motion in arrest of judgment on the first ground stated therein; that is, that this information was not laid in time, that is, within thirty days after the return of the committing magistrate to the District Court of Yellowstone County of the complaint and other papers in his hands relative to this matter. Section 2 of “ an act relating to information in criminal cases,” found on page 248, Second Session, 1891, Montana, is mandatory and requires the prosecuting attorney within thirty days after the return or delivery of the complaint and other papers to the proper District Court, to file in such court an information, etc. The delivery of the papers in this case was made August 5, 1891. The information was laid October 20, 1891. No leave of the court, as provided in the first section of said act, is recited or even relied upon in said information as the ground for said action; hence, we say the statute being mandatory and not having been complied with, the first ground of said motion should have been sustained. (Potter’s Dwarris on Statutes, pp. 222-226; Cooley’s Constitutional Limitations, pp. 88-98.) II. The court erred in overruling defendant’s objection to the introduction of the order made by the county commissioners to Church. For if it was necessary in order for the State to make its case that the legality of the road and the authority by which the said Church and the officers were there endeavoring to open a road should be proven, then certainly there should have been allowed to the defendant the right to prove that there was no road there to open, and that the pretense of an order, by virtue of which they were there, was invalid and of no effect for any reason, and especially that the order was issued without any authority either over the subject-matter or the persons. III. Proceeding of a board of commissioners laying out a highway, which is void because of failure to comply with statutory requirements, constitutes no justification to such supervisors for a threatened occupation by them of the land for the purpose of such highway. (Ruhland v. Jones, 55 \"Wis. 673; Church v. Joint School District, 55 Wis. 399; Ruhland v. Supervisors of Town etc. 55 Wis. 664; State v. Castle, 44 Wis. 670; Roehrborn v. Schmidt, 16 Wis. 519; Flint & Pere Marquette Ry. Co. v. Willey, 47 Mich. 88; Carroll v. State, 23 Ala. 28; 58 Am. Dec. 282; In re Grove St. 61 Cal. 438; 2 Dillon on Municipal Corporations [3d ed.], § 769; People v. Spencer, 55 N. Y. 1; People v. Supervisors, 11 N. Y. 563; Westfall v. Preston, 49 N. Y. 353; In re Gty of Buffalo, 78 N. Y. 362.) The rule is that evidence showing threats not communicated, as well as those cummunicated, should be received in a criminal case for the purpose of showing the intent with which an act is done and the relative status of the parties. (Wiggins v. People, 93.U. S. 465, 467; Stokes v. People, 53 N. Y. 164; 13 Am. Rep. 492; Lyon v. Hancock, 35 Cal. 372; Campbell v. People, 16 111. 17; 61 Am. Dec. 49; 17 Wharton’s Criminal Evidence, § 757.) Hence the defendant should have been allowed to show just what the instructions were that were given by the board of commissioners to Ramsey and Terrill when they went with Church to open this particular road. A man need not be in actual imminent peril or danger of his life or of\\'great bodily harm before he may slay his assailant. It is sufficient if in good faith he believes, from the facts as they appear to him at the time, that his life is in such imminent danger. (People v. Payne, 8 Cal. 343; People v. Honshell, 10 Cal. 88; People v. Flanagan, 60 Cal. 2; 44 Am. Rep. 52; Wharton’s Criminal Law [8th ed.], §§ 97, 100, 487, 489, 501, 505-520; Cooley ou Torts, §§ 324, 326; Iron Mountain etc. P. P. v.

Dec. 286; 1 Bishop on Criminal Law, §§ 841, 849; 1 Lawson’s Defenses to Crime, § 386.) It was for the jury to say by its verdict whether Church, Ramsey, and Terrill were committing a mere trespass or were there intending to do injury to the property or person of the defendant with an armed body of men. The instruction given on this question invades the province of the jury and determines the issue that should have been submitted to them. (Preston v. Heys, 23 Cal. 195; Brumagim v. Bradshaw, 39 Cal. 51; Cahoon v. Marshall, 25 Cal. 198; Wood v. Tomlinson, 53 Cal. 720.) Tbe intent to commit murder is the gist of this action. No injury being done, hence no inference of intent is manifest or can be drawn from the act done; therefore, direct proof must be made of the intent, and it is for the jury to find whether this element of the crime was present, and it is eminently proper that the jury should be instructed on the basic element of the crime charged. (State v. Bloedow, 45 Wis. 279; People v. Keefer, 18 Cal. 637; People v. IAlley, 43 Mich. 521; Wharton’s Criminal Law, § 641, et seq.) Toole & Wallace, of counsel, for Appellant. I. The court erred in excluding the evidence tending to show that the proceedings and order of the county commissioners was void. It is conceded that the order was introduced for the purpose of showing the good faith of Church, and that he was justified in doing or attempting to do what he did. If, therefore, the order was competent as going to show the real\\' ¡nxrpose with which the act was done or attempted to be done by Church, it was a legitimate link in the chain of testimony tending to rebut the presumption thereby raised, to show as a fact that such order was void, and as explanatory of his real purpose. He had been notified and admonished not to attempt to tear down the fence and open the road under such an order, which in consideration of the fact that it was void, not only made it competent in rebuttal of the good faith of Church, but was a circumstance calculated to excite hot blood in appellant, aud extenuate the crime charged. Had the evidence showing that the proceedings and order were void been admitted, the jury would have been able to determine whether the grade of the offense was reduced to an attempt to commit manslaughter, or justifiable, as the case may be, on account of the ownership and right of possession of appellant, and the violent and forcible attempt to enter by Church and his confederates. Appellant then had a right to establish his title and right of possession as tending to show his mental condition at the time of the shooting, to rebut the inferences of premeditation and malice arising from the use of a deadly weapon, and thereby extenuate the crime, if death had ensued from the shot fired, from an attempt to commit murder to an attempt to commit manslaughter. (Wharton’s Criminal Law [8th ed.], § 641; State v. White, 45 Iowa, 325; State v. Waters, 39 Me. 54; State v. Phinney, 42 Me. 384; State v. Butman, 42 N. H. 490; State v. Peed, 40 Vt. 603; State v. Nichols, 8 Conn. 496; Beehwith v. People, 26 111. 500; People v. Congleton, 44 Cal. 92; Wall v. State, 23 Ind. 150.) That appellant had a right to show that the proceedings and order were void, and that he was the actual owner of the crop and premises, for the purpose of reducing the grade of the offense to an attempt to commit manslaughter, we also cite People v. Costello, 15 Cal. 350; People v. Payne, 8 Cal. 341; State v. Rutherford, 1 Hawks, 457; 9 Am. Dec. 658; State v. Zellers, 7 N. J. L. 230; In re drove St. 61 Cal. 438; In re City of Buffalo-, 78 N. Y. 362.) If the order and proceedings were void it was a highly provoking attempt to take by force the property of defendant from his possession, and was competent in determining the state of his mind and as explanatory of his acts. II. The court should have admitted the evidence offered going to show that the order was void; that appellant was holding possession as owner, and of the threats that were made, so as to leave the question fairly to the jury whether appellant was compelled to choose between killing Church or submission to an unlawful eviction from the lawful possession of his own property. If the emergency was so pressing as to leave it his only alternative to fire the shots or surrender his right to defend his property, evidence of these threats tended to show such emergency and was competent either in mitigation or justification. (1 Wharton’s Criminal Law [8 ed.], 414, and authorities under note 5; Slachby’s Case, 1 East, p. 5, § 158 ; Housin v. Barrow, 6 Term Rep. 122; 1 Russell on Crimes, § 621.) The combination was an armed body of men to commit an unlawful act in disturbing appellant in the enjoyment of a legal right, and threats were evidence of the intention to do so. (Gommonw. v. Runnels, 10 Mass. 518; 6 Am. Dec. 148; Comp. Stats, p. 538, || 144, 145; Kiphart v. State, 42 Ind. 273.) III. The statute in some cases makes a given state of facts presumptive evidence of others, and in such cases the court is warranted in so instructing the jury. But here the court has gone further and made a given state of facts conclusive of defend ant’s guilt, leaving out altogether the essential ingredients of the crime. It assumes to tell the jury that if Church was acting in good faith in attempting to lay out a road under the order of the court, regardless of how it may have appeared to defendant, as a reasonable person, it could not in law, as a fact, be an attempt by violence to commit a felony, and consequently the shooting was an attempt to commit murder. Without reference to the state of defendant’s mind, it assumes not only to tell the jury what presumptions are raised from certain facts, but what conclusions must emphatically be reached and pronounced by their verdict. (Comp. Stats. § 275, p. 456; People v. Walden, 51 Cal. 589, 604; Stone v. Geyser M. Co. 52 Cal. 318; 2 Hayne on New Trial and Appeal, 335; People v. Carrillo, 54 Cal. 63; 1 Greenleaf on Evidence, 48.) Section 33, page 507 of the Compiled Laws of Montana, is applicable to the offense charged in the information, and is entirely ignored in defining what facts constitute the crime. The court in so many words told the jury that the facts stated, etc., were insufficient to generate a reasonable fear that a felony was about to be committed, when it should have been left to the jury from the evidence before them, upon instructions as to the law applicable in such cases. Such is the rule aside from the statute. (1 Bishop on Criminal Law, 841, et seq.; Horrigan & Thompson’s Cases — Self Defense, 866.) If defendant had a legal right to resist the trespass and would have been slain if he did so, he was compelled to submit under the instruction of the court. This would absolutely deprive a man of using such force as was used to defend his property and possessions, thereby reversing the whole doctrine of criminal jurisprudence upon the subject. The jury should have passed upon the question involved. (Horrigan & Thompson’s Cases — Self Defense, 863-866.) Any fact that would tend to show provocation was competent under the authorities as tending to disprove malice and premeditation. (Wharton’s Criminal Evidence [8th ed.], 334; Maher v. People, 10 Mich. 212; 81 Am. Dec. 781.) Intent to commit manslaughter is included in the information, and if the jury has reasonable doubt as to premeditation or malice, they could not convict of assault with intent to murder. (Wharton’s Criminal Evidence [8th ed.], 721, and note 1.) Henri J. Haslcell, Attorney-General, and James R. Goss, for the State, Respondent. The motion in arrest of judgment upon the ground that the information was not filed within thirty days from the time the defendant was committed, was properly denied, as the record shows that the same was filed in the presence of the court by the county attorney and by the order of the court. The action of the court in ordering the information to be filed is supported by the provisions of section 2 of “an act relating to informations in criminal cases,” approved March 2, 1891, page 249, Laws of 1891. This ground here relied on, on motion in arrest of judgment, is not authorized by statute. (§ 357, ch. 13, div. 3, Crim. Prac. Act.) Motion in arrest of judgment can only be based on statutory grounds. (People v. Indian Peter, 48 Cal. 250; People v. McCarty, 48 Cal. 559; People v. Fair, 43 Cal. 137.) The order of the board of county commissioners which was offered in evidence and admitted over the objections of the defendant was material to show the authority of the road supervisor to act, and his justification for opening the road through defendant’s land. The record of the commissioners’ proceedings was offered by defendant for the purpose of showing that the requirements of law in the matter of laying of the road had not been complied with, and the supervisor was therefore a trespasser, and the defendant was justified in using force to prevent him from acting under the order. The record was immaterial. It is a rule of law, that where the trespass is barely against the property of another, not his dwelling-house, it is not a provocation sufficient to warrant the owner in using a deadly weapon; if he does, and with it kill the trespasser, this will be murder, because it is an act of violence beyond the degree of provocation. (Commonw. v. Drew, 4 Mass. 395; Roberts v. State, 14 Mo. 138; 55 Am. Dec. 101; State v. Vance, 17 Iowa, 148; McDaniel v. State, 8 Smedes & M. 401; 47 Am. Dec. 99; Kunkle v.

Dec. 286, 287; People v. Miller, 49 Mich. 23; Blake ,v. State, 3 Tex. App. 589.) The defendant in this case had a remedy by injunction or writ of certiorari (Church v. Joint School Districts, 55 Wis. 403; Diedrichs v. Northwestern TJ. By. Oo. 33 \"Wis. 219), or by appeal to the District Court. (§ 1821, div. 5, Gen. Laws.)',\n",

While the owner of property may not commit a homicide for the purpose of protecting it against a trespasser, he is not bound to a passive submission which neither remonstrates nor resists. 3. On indictment for homicide it appeared that defendant’s brother was the owner of a parcel of ground upon which deceased had, without his knowledge or consent, erected a shanty, and of which he was holding possession. The owner, with others, entered upon the land for the purpose either of forcibly ejecting any person that might be in possession or removing the shanty without such person’s consent, and in the controversy which followed deceased was killed by defendant. The jury were instructed, in substance, that if they should find that the defendant, in company with his brother, or soon after, entered upon the land in furtherance of the common design, and was aiding and advising him therein, and that he was aware at the time that the difficulty had arisen from such entry and design, then the killing would not be justifiable and the defendant should be found guilty.

Nuisance. Ice and Snow. Easement, By prescription. In an action by a woman for injuries from falling on ridges of ice on a highway caused by the freezing of water accumulated by a retaining wall and grading on land of the defendant alleged to be a nuisance, if it appears that the plaintiff was walking on a cross walk of a public highway at a reasonably slow pace, that she was looking ahead as she walked, that she had no reason to expect one side of the street to be more dangerous than the other and that she wore rubbers, and she testifies that on account of her physical condition at the time she was taking greater care than she otherwise would have done, the fact that she could see ice at the place where she fell as well as on other sidewalks in that vicinity is not conclusive against her, and she is entitled to go to the jury on the question of her due care. A landowner has no right to maintain a retaining wall and a grading of his land which cause surface water to collect and to overflow upon a highway so as to create a nuisance by a dangerous accumulation of ice, and if he does so he is liable to a traveller on the highway who in the exercise of due care is injured by a fall caused by such accumulation. If a landowner maintains a retaining wall and a grading of his land which cause surface water to collect and to overflow upon a sidewalk and a cross walk of a highway creating a dangerous accumulation of ice there, he is none the less liable for an injury caused by such nuisance because when he acquired the land the retaining wall and the grading already were upon it and both the wall and the surface of the ground have remained without change for fifty years. A landowner cannot acquire by prescription a right to maintain a public nuisance. Tort for personal injuries from falling on an icy cross walk near the premises of the defendant’s intestate in Jamaica Plain on February 2, 1904. Writ dated April 5, 1904. In the Superior Court the case was tried before Aiken, C. J. The following facts among others appeared at the trial. The plaintiff fell on a cross walk on Green Street, a public highway, where it is intersected by a private way called Lamar-tine Square. The fee of Lamartine Square was in the defendant’s intestate at the time the plaintiff fell. The premises in question had been in the possession of the defendant’s intestate since 1844 and the defendant’s intestate had lived on the premises for many years before February 2, 1904. The sidewalk on Green Street was lower than the premises of the intestate and there was a low retaining wall of rubble laid in mortar and water tight, extending along the entire front of the premises on Green Street and surmounted by a picket fence. At the corner of Lamartine Street the top of the wall was about a foot above the sidewalk on Green Street, and at Lamartine Square about a foot and a half above the sidewalk on Green Street. The general slope of Green Street is downward from Lamartine Street to Lamartine Square, there being a drop in that distance of three feet. The top of the wall was about six inches above the land inside it. The earth inside and immediately adjacent to the wall was a few inches higher than the surface ten feet inside the wall. Both Lamartine Street and Lamartine Square, as well as the surface of the premises in question, rise gradually from Green Street to the northeast on an average of five feet in one hundred, and there also is a general slope from the northwesterly corner of the premises to the southeasterly corner of the premises at the junction of Green Street and Lamartine Square. The plaintiff in company with her sister had been to make a call on Chestnut Avenue, which leads off Green Street on the same side on- which the intestate’s premises were. In going to make this call she had proceeded along Green Street on the side opposite these premises. In returning she passed along the sidewalk on the side of Green Street adjacent to the premises in question. She described the accident as follows: “ As I came along, just to Lamartime Square, I wasn’t thinking of anything, looking straight ahead of me, when all of a sudden my left foot slipped forward, across me and I fell forward, over.” She testified that it was at the crossing at Lamar-tine Square. The evidence upon the issue of the plaintiff’s due care, as well as upon the issue of the defendant’s liability, is described in the opinion. ■ There was no evidence as to when or by whom the retaining wall was built, but it appeared that both the wall and the surface of the ground had remained without change for fifty years, and there was no evidence as to what the conditions were before that time. There was no evidence of the method em ployed when the wall was constructed, or to show whether earth was at that time thrown up against the wall. A civil engineer called by the defendant testified that in his opinion the land in its natural condition had been cut away, and the wall built for the double purpose of holding back the earth on the premises and affording a foundation support for the fence, that in its natural original state the lowest part of the valley was at a point within the wall and upon the intestate’s estate. A civil engineer called by the plaintiff testified that in his opinion the lowest part of the valley in the natural, original state of the land was outside the wall at a point now Green Street. At the close of the evidence the defendant asked the Chief Justice to make certain rulings which he refused. Most of these have become immaterial because the exceptions to their refusal were not argued. The seventh instruction asked for, the refusal of which is referred to in the opinion, was as follows: “ 7. The owner or occupier of land is not liable for injuries to persons or property by reason of water flowing from his land in its natural condition, nor is he liable if by reason of such ordinary boundaries as picket fences or retaining walls made necessary by the lower grade of the adjacent street the surface water from his land escapes in larger volume at a given point than it would in the absence of such ordinary boundaries.” The Chief Justice in his charge to the jury, among other things, instructed them as follows: “ If, by the maintenance of the wall, or the grading of the ground, or by both causes in combination, an artificial channel was formed through which additional surface water flowed in a substantially greater quantity than it would otherwise flow, and the water was discharged upon the street by reason of such channel in substantially greater quantity than the natural drainage, and the quantity of ice was substantially increased thereby, on which the plaintiff fell, in the exercise of due care, then Mrs. Evans [the defendant’s intestate] is responsible. “ There is no responsibility in this case unless you are satisfied that there was an artificial channel upon that portion of the premises in the vicinity of Green Street and that this artificial channel caused a substantial increase in the flow of water to the southeast corner of the Evans estate, and a substantial increase in the discharge upon the cross walk at the entrance to Lamar-tine Square and that this substantial increase in the flow and discharge contributed to cause the ice at that point upon which the plaintiff fell, and by contributed, I mean formed part of the ice upon which the plaintiff fell. If the plaintiff has made out these propositions that I have stated as necessary, viz. due care, in the first place, on her part; second, the existence of an artificial channel by which there was a substantial increase in the flow of the water, and a substantial increase in the discharge of the water at the cross walk, which substantial increase in the flow, and discharge of the water, contributed to cause the ice on which the plaintiff fell, then there is a right to recover, and you will assess damages on the principles I have laid down. Unless the two propositions that I have laid down as essential are made out, there is no right, and your verdict will be for the defendant.” The defendant alleged exceptions, of which those that were argued are mentioned in the first paragraph of the opinion. The portion of the charge excepted to included the paragraphs quoted above. E. K. Arnold, for the defendant. C. H. Donahue, for the plaintiff.',\n",

       "  'case_summary': \"DULCE REALTY COMPANY v. STAED REALTY COMPANY, Appellant. Division Two, November 13, 1912. 1. EASEMENT: Private Alley: Created by Deeds in Partition. Deeds by cotenants in partition of land in a city block designating a certain plot of ground as a private alley left by all concerned, create an easement in the alley which passes in after conveyances with the estates to which it is appurtenant as long as the estates subsist as distinct estates in different proprietors. 2. -: -: Estate of Abutting Proprietor. In the absence of evidence to the contrary it will be presumed that the owners of property abutting on a private way hold the fge to the center of the way. 3. -: -: Acquired By Deed: Not Lost by Nonuser. An easement acquired by deed cannot be lost by mere nonuser. 4. -: -: -: -: Evidence. lilis is a suit to enjoin the construction of a building on an alleged private alley and to compel the removal of one already erected. The defendants, who own land abutting on the west, had notice from their deeds that the strip in question was a private alley, and it was open, when they took possession of their land in 1891, as a five-foot space between two-story brick buildings. In 1892 the strip was closed by the erection of a frame structure, the rent for which was collected and paid to the defendants, according to testimony for defendant, by a tenant and agent of an earlier owner of the land upon the east now owned by plaintiff. Immediately following 1892 the west part of the alley was assessed to the defendants; not all of it, however, until 1900, yet they have executed various deeds in which the strip in question is called a private alley. Before judgment herein they had begun the erection of a brick building covering a portion of the strip. Held, that the beginning of the possession was hy permission of a former owner in plaintiff’s chain of title and that such possession was not under any .adverse claim of right. N.o possession can result in title by limitation unless the same is under a claim of right or color of title. The injunction is allowed and the removal of the structures is ordered. Appeal from St. Louis City Circuit Court. — Hon. Moses N. Sale, Judge. AkI'IB.MED. Dmiel Dillon for appellant. (1) Open, notorious, adverse and continuous possession of land for ten years confers title on the person holding such possession. This has been decided so often by this court, and has become, so well recognized as a rule of law in this State, that a citation of cases is unnecessary. Fugate v. Pierce, 49 Mo. 441; Bradley v. West, 60 Mo. 40; Scanned. v. Soda Fountain Co., 161 Mo. 618; Franklin v. Cunningham, 187 Mo. 195; Brewing Co. v. Payne, 197 Mo. 422; Adam v. Gossom, 228 Mo. 578; Long v. Coal & I. Co., 233 Mo. 740. On February 11, 1891, the Staeds; on the same day they received a deed for the eighty-four feet fronting on Chestnut street, received, also, from the same grantors, a quitclaim deed to the five-foot strip fronting on Chestnut street and extending south thirty-one feet. This'gave them at least color of title to the five-foot, strip for.the length or depth of thirty-one feet extending southward from Chestnut street. Even without any color of title at all, open, notorious and adverse continuous possession for ten years gives title to the land actually occupied. Cottle v. Sydnor, 10 Mo. 770; St. Louis v. Gorman, 29 Mo. 593;'De Gráw v. Taylor, 37 Mo. 310; Mather v. Waltz, 107 Mo. 121; Wilkerson v. Eilers, 114 Mo. 253; Goldterman v. Schiermeyer, 111 Mo. 404; Quick v. Bufe, 164 Mo. 412. (2) The period fixed by the Statute of Limitations for the bringing of action for the recovery of real property applies to easements in land in like manner as to the land itself. Jones on Easements, Secs. 866 and 867; Wimer v. Simmons, 27 Ore. 3; Woodruff v. Paddock, 130 N. Y. 618; Galveston v. Williams, 69 Tex. 454; Boyce v. Railroad, 168 Mo. 591; Pittsman v.

(3) If some former owner of the land now owned by plaintiff was at one time entitled to an easement, entitling him to the nse of the five feet in question as an alley, that easement was abandoned and extinguished long before plaintiff became the owner of the property. Scanned. v. Soda Fountain Co., 161 Mo. 620. Twenty years was the period within which actions for the recovery of real property were required to be brought in those jurisdictions, where the court held that an adverse user for twenty years would extinguish an easement. In this State, as this court well knows, the period of limitation for bringing such actions is ten years. Richard A, Jones for respondent. (1) (a) The private alley so established, created an easement by express grant for such purposes. Church v. Kellar, 39 Mo. App. 441; Carlin v. Paul, '11 Mo. 32; Moses v. Dock Co., 84 Mo. 244; Parker v. Smith, 17 Mass. 411; Dill v. Board, 10 L. R. A. 276. (b) The creation of such alley gave to adjoining lots two distinct classes of rights; first, its use for purposes of ingress and egress, and, second, for light, air and ventilation. Dill v. Board, 10 L. R. A. 276; Gaus v. Railroad, 113 Mo. 308; Bloom v. Koch, 63 N. J. Eq. 10; Field v. Barling, 24 L. R. A. 406; Arnett'v. Johnson, 15 N. J. Eq. 482; DeGeofroy v. Railroad, 179 Mo. 698; Barbour v. Liddy, 49 Fed. 896. (c) This easement by grant is a property right, as much as the ownership of the soil itself, and one of which the owner can only be deprived by like character of instrument or by such adverse possession for the statutory period, with all the accompanying elements necessary, not only to create title in the fee of the real estate itself, but also adverse as against the exercise of the various rights included in the easement. Nohuser for the statutory or any other length of time does not in any manner affect such, easement any more than would nonnser of any other character of real estate. Dill v. Board, 10 L. R. A. 276; Structural Co. v. Distilling Co., 189 Mass. 145; Hofher v. Mede, 226 111. 320; Johnson v.’Clark, 22 Ky. Law R. 418; Dwire v. Hawley, 79 Conn. 454. (2) (a) Lying at the foundation of the claim .of title by limitation is the one all-controlling fact that the possession relied on must be adverse, — hostile, and continuously so, for ten years. The possession from end to end, in warp and woof, must be hostile and continuously hostile. And this is so because the law presumes every possession as consistent with the true title and ownership. McCune v. Groodwillie, 204 Mo. 306; Ileckescher v. Cooper, 203 Mo. 278; Dameron v. Jamison, 143 Mo. 483. (c) Various deeds of conveyance were executed by defendant during the time it claims the alley was held by it by a possession adverse, which conclusively negative any such quality of possession. One of these deeds was executed October 24, 1894, another April 8, 1901 and' still another May 6, 1907, some three months prior to the commencement of this proceeding. Also deeds executed to defendant and by its predecessors in title of like character. In all of these deeds, the property of defendant is' described as extending on the east to this private alley and indeed in the three first mentioned, the very width of the alley is given. The east bounds of the property, 125 feet east of the east line of Ninth street, the west boundary of the alley, also corresponds with the description of it contained in the deeds by which it was originally established. Mere oral testimony of statements made by a party in possession of real estate is competent to destroy the adverse character of the occupancy; much more is such evidence of value for such purposes when embodied in the solemn act of executing an instrument of conveyance of realty. Indeed, in such case it is conclusive proof of acknowledgment that the holding is not adverse, a disclaimer which may not be denied. Lajoye v. Primm, 3 Mo. 529; Whyte v. St. Louis, 153 Mo. 80; Anthony v. Building Co., 188 Mo. 704; Devoe v. Smeltzer, 86 Iowa, 391; Lamb v. Foss, 21 Me. 240; Heard v. Conner, 84 S. W. 605; Whitaker v. Thayer, 38 Tex.' Civ.

(3) (a) The frame structure over a portion of the alley was unlawfully erected and maintained and so ipso facto constituted a public nuisance. Railroad v. Kirkwood, 159 Mo. 239; Boom Co. v. Dickson, 77 Miss. 587. (b) Being such nuisance no matter how long continued, no prescriptive right could be acquired to maintain it. It was subject to abatement at any time. State ex reí. v. Vandalia, 119 Mo. App. 426; Kissel v. Lewis, 156 Ind. 233; Hynes v. Brewer, 194 Mass. 435; Isham v. Brodericks, 89 Minn. 397. (4) The quitclaim deed from Caroline Ryan, of date February 11, 1891, in which she- quitclaimed her interest in “a parcel of land known as a private alley” does not contain anything inconsistent with the easement for alley purposes. This instrument would not constitute even such color of title as against such easement as would cause an occupancy of part to relate to the whole thirty-one feet, the purpose for which defendant claims it was offered in evidence.

Where the boundary line of adjoining land-owners, called for in their deeds, and ascertainable with certainty by survey, had been altered by agreement of the parties, and the' occupancy by each up to the agreed line, by improvements and otherwise, had been acquiesced in and continued for a sufficient length of time to bar a right of entry, under the statute of limitations: Held, that an answer setting up these facts constitutes a good defense to an action by one of such owners, or his grantee with notice, for the recovery of the land lying between the two lines. 2. The fixing of a boundary line by parol is not within the operation of the statute of frauds — no estate is thereby created; but where the boundary line is fixed by the parties, they hold up to it by virtue of their title-deeds, and not by virtue of the parol transfer. Reserved in the District Court of Yintou county. On the 24th of August, 1861, Mary Richmond commenced an action, in the Court of Common Pleas of Yinton county, against Joseph Bobo, to recover possession of about three acres of the west half of the northwest quarter of section 28, in township 11, of range 17, in Yinton county, being a strip of land one hundred rods long, and about six rods wide, along the east line of the west half of the quarter, and described in the petition by metes and bounds, which she alleges the defendant, Bobo, has wrongfully detained from her possession since the 1st day of April, 1861, and asks judgment for the delivery of the possession to her. The answer of the defendant contains three separate defenses: Defense No. 1 admits the possession by him of the premises in dispute, and denies the plaintiff’s' title thereto, and her right to the' possession thereof. Defense No. 2 sets out, as a bar to the plaintiff’s right to-maintain her action that Amos Shry, the grantor of the defendant, and under whom he claims and holds possession of the disputed premises, was, at one time, the owner in fee-simple of the whole of the northwest quarter of the section named, and on the 3d day of July, 1833, sold to John L. Shry eighty acres off of the west side of ■ the quarter, which Amos and John L. then proceeded to lay off, and to' establish the line between their respective possessions, which they did by a line running north and south through the quarter, on the west line of the premises-now in dispute; that on the same day, Amos Shry conveyed to John L. Shry the eighty acres sold to him, by deed in fee-simple, they both meaning and intending by the deed to grant on the one part, and to take and hold on the other, the eighty acres of the quarter west of the line they had agreed upon and established; that afterward, on the 3d day of February, 1836, David Richmond being desirous of purchasing John L. Shry’s interest in the quarter, applied to John L. and Amos Shry for information in regard to the quantity of land owned by John L. Shry, and was informed by them that John L. Shry owned the west eighty acres of the quarter, and they also pointed out to Richmond the east line of the eighty-acre tract,, which was the line agreed upon and established by Amos and John L. as the boundary line between their respective portions of the quarter; that Richmond proposed to describe the land in the deed as the west half of the quarter, to which both the Shrys objected, if such description would include more than the eighty acres supposed to be contained within the agreed line; that the Shrys and Richmond surveyed the eighty-acre tract, and found that the east boundary line, so agreed upon and established by Amos and John L., was substantially correct, and Richmond staked the line, after which, and on the same day, John L. Shry conveyed the eighty-acre tract to Richmond, by a deed in fee-simple, in which the land sold was described as the west half of the quarter containing eighty acres; that Richmond afterward built a fence on the line he had so staked, extending through the quarter, as and for the line-fence between his lands and those of Amos Shry; that at the time Richmond built the line-fence, he was fully advised of all his rights [“ and at -the time of the purchase well knew that the west half of the quarter included more than eighty acres, and went east of the agreed line”]; that during the time John L. Shry and David Richmond were the owners, and in possession of the eighty-acre tract, Amos Shry was in the undisturbed possession of the disputed premises, and, with the knowledge of John L. Shry and David Richmond, cleared and inclosed them, and made lasting and valuable improvements thereon, and that he, and his grantee, Joseph Bobo, so continued in the possession thereof until the commencement of the action by Mary Richmond, who derives her title from Patrick Murdoch, a purchaser at a judicial sale of the lands, as the property of David Richmond, and claims that by reason of the premises the plaintiff is es-topped from claiming title to, or possession of the premises. Defense No. 3 sets up the bar of the statute of limitations. The reply of the plaintiff to defense No. 2 admits the ownership by Amos Shry of the whole quarter; the sale by him of a portion of it to John L. Shry; the conveyance by John L. Shry of his interest in the premises to David Richmond, and the derivation of her title, as stated in the answer; and avers that Amos Shry sold and conveyed to John L. Shry, the entire west half of the quarter, which was afterward sold and conveyed by John L. Shry to David Richmond, and denies each and every other allegation therein contained. The reply also denies each and every allegation of defense No. 3. At the May term, 1864, the cause came on for trial to a jury, and after the plaintiff had rested her cause, the defendant called as a witness Amos Shry, by whom he offered to prove the facts set up in defense No. 2 of his answer, to which the plaintiff objected, and the court sustained the objection; to which ruling of the court the defendant excepted. A juror was thereupon withdrawn, and leave given to the defendant to amend his answer in sixty days, upon payment of costs, for -which judgment was rendered against the defendant; to which the defendant also excepted, and a' bill of exceptions, containing the exceptions to both rulings of the court, was signed and sealed, and made part of the record herein. The amendment afterward made, is inclosed in brackets, and marked quoted, in the answer as above set out. At the subsequent March term, 1867, the cause, by consent-of the parties, was submitted to the court for trial. The plaintiff, to maintain the issue on her part, gave evidence tending to prove.the allegations of her petition, and also,that the premises conveyed by Amos Shry to John L. Shry were described as the west half of the northwest quarter; that the conveyance from John L. Shry to David Richmond was for the west half of the quarter containing eighty acres ; that the conveyance of the sheriff of Yinton county to Patrick Murdoch, was for the west half of the quarter containing “ eighty acres, more or less; ” that the deed to the plaintiff contained the same description — the west half of the quarter containing “ eighty acres, more or less;” that the line dividing the quarter into east and west halves was not surveyed until after the death of David Richmond, in 1850, at which time Amos Shry was in the actual possession of the premises in dispute, and had the-same inclosed and fenced, and that the quarter section contained one hundred and seventy-two acres, instead of one hundred and sixty acres; and rested her case. Whereupon the defendant, to maintain the issue on his part, called as a witness Amos Shry, by whom he offered to prove all the allegations of defense No. 2, set out in his answer, to which the plaintiff objected. The court sustained the objection and excluded the evidence, to which ruling of the court the defendant excepted; and the defendant, declining to offer other or further evidence under defense No. 2, or either of the other defenses, the court thereupon found the allegations of the plaintiff’s petition to be true, and adjudged the premises to her, with costs. A bill of exceptions, embodying the evidence of the plaintiff below, and the rulings excepted to by the defendant below during the progress of the trial, was signed and sealed by the court, and made part of the record in the case. A petition in error was afterward filed in the District Court of Vinton county, to reverse the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, upon the grounds that the court erred in sustaining the objection of the defendant in error to the evidence offered by the plaintiff in error, and in rendering judgment against the plaintiff in error, as set forth in the first and second bills of exceptions, which, at the September term, 1868, of the District Court, was reserved for decision in this court.

The distinction is wide and well recognized in Ohio as well as elsewhere. Hunt v. Guilford, 4 Ohio, 316; Hagey v. Detweiler, 35 Penn. St. 409 ; Boyd’s Lessee v. Graves, 4 Wheat. 413; Blair v.

But I deny that the question here is one of boundary merely; it is a question of title. G. & Okey’s Digest, 475, sec. 36; Walker v. Devlin, 2 Ohio St. 593. The rule laid down in the authorities last cited is of a disputed and uncertain boundary, and it is not too much to say that the rule must be infinitely stronger in a ease like this one, where there is •no dispute and where the line is a fixed and certain one— a mathematical line. The agreed line in this ease was fixed oy mistake. “ A party is not to be estopped to prove a legal title to his estate by any misrepresentation of its locality, made by mistake, without fraud or intentional deception, although another party may be induced thereby to purchase an adjoining lot, the title to which may prove defective.” Herman’s Law of Estoppel, 489, 490, citing Prop. Liverpool Wharf v. Prescott, 7 Allen, 494; Thayer v. Bacon, 3 Allen, 163; Coon v. Smith, 29 N. Y. 392; Baldwin v. Brown, 16 N. Y. 359; Russell v. Malony, 39 Vt. 580; Brewer v. Boston & Wor. R. R., 5 Met. 478; Cook v. Babcock, 11 Cush. 210. The distinction between allowing an estoppel in the case of a boundary merely, and where to allow it would be to transfer title to a part of the lands, seems to be well recognized. The award of arbitrators may settle a boundary so as to be binding on the parties to it, but no award as to the title to any part of the lands would be binding. Vosburgh v. Yeaton, 32 N. H. 567; Jackson v. Dysling, 2 Caine, 198; Kabberton v. McNeil, 12 Wend. 578; Terry v. Chandler, 16 N. Y. 356; 21 Ohio St. 596. To sustain the estoppel set up, would be, as I have before contended, not to settle a boundary merely, but to transfer the title to the strip of land in controversy.\",\n",

Deed — description of the property conveyed—effect of a reference therein to a map ■ on which a street is laid out on a tine differing from the one, at the time, in actual use — estoppel, by acquiescence in the building of a house and fence. Hosea Rhodes and Hiram Dean, who owned a plot of land at the intersection of \"Union and Coleman streets in the city of Clean, conveyed a part of it to one .Ryan, by a deed which described the land conveyed as “ a portion of the northeast corner of block fifteen, according to a map of said village made by T.

Held, that the west line of Union street, as used and existing at the time of the execution of the deeds, was treated by the parties as a monument; That the parties contracted with reference to that monument as a matter of fact, and\\'that if the map line was\\'subsequently found to be, different from the line of occupation, the latter must control; That the reference to the Gosseline map, contained in the deed to Ryan, did not operate to incorporate the map into the deed, hut that, if it did, the line of the street as actually opened and used must control. Semble, that as Dean and Rhodes allowed Ryan to huild his house and fence without making any suggestion that he had not properly located his lot, they would he estopped from claiming that the eleven feet in dispute should be taken from Ryaii’s land.

APPEAL from a judgment entered upon the report and decision of a referee. The action was brought to foreclose a mortgage executed by the defendant to Alexander E. Shaw. The plaintiff was the assignee of the mortgage. The referee found that the Holland Land Company was seised of lot Ho. 98, and that on the 27th of May, 1834, the company conveyed in fee to one Clark Hilton a portion of the lot bounded east and west by the lines of the lot, and north by a line parallel with the south line of said lot, and 34 chains and 2 links northerly therefrom. On the 10th of April, 1838, the company conveyed to the Farmers’ Loan and Trust Company a portion of the lot, bounded north by a line parallel to the north bounds of said lot, at the distance of 9 chains south therefrom 55 chains and 92 links; east by township Ho. 12 &c. 12 chains and 10 links; south by land heretofore deeded to Clark Hilton 55 chains and 92 links; west by lot Ho. 92, 11 chains and 94 links, containing 67 acres of land, be the same more or less. The Farmers’ Loan and Trust Company conveyed, by the same description, to one Brink; and Brink conveyed to Beebe, who, on the 10th of January, 1843, conveyed to Shaw by the same description; and Shaw on the 5th of Hovember, 1849, conveyed by deed containing covenants of seisin and warranty, to the defendant, by the same description. The defendant executed to Shaw his bond and the mortgage in question, containing the same description, to secure a portion of the purchase money. Shaw sold, and the defendant purchased, the land in gross. Ho survey or measurement was contemplated by either party. The purchase money to be paid was $1876, and this amount was ascertained by estimating the land at 67 acres, at $28 an acre. The defendant entered into possession immediately. By a survey afterwards made, it was established that the north line of the lot (98) was, on the east line of the lot, only 16 chains and 23 links, and on the west line 16 chains and 7 links north of the land conveyed to Clark Hilton. At the time Shaw conveyed to the defendant, and for a great many years previous, there was a fence extending across the lot from east to west, parallel with the north line of the lot, and 9 chains south therefrom; and also a fence across the lot east and west, starting at a point in the east line of the lot, 21 chains and 10 links south of the north line of the lot, and reaching the west line of the lot 20 chains and 94 links south of said north line. The quantity of land between these fences and the east and west lines of the lot, was 67 acres. At the time Shaw sold and conveyed to the defendant, both parties believed that the said fences marked the north and south lines of the land conveyed, and that the quantity was 67 acres. In 1851, the heirs of Clark Hilton recovered, in an action of ejectment against this defendant, the -strip of land north of the above mentioned south fence, extending across the lot, containing 27J acres; Shaw had notice of the action, and was required to defend it. The referee decided, as conclusions of law, that the plaintiff was entitled to the usual judgment of foreclosure, and that the facts did not constitute any defense; that the defendant was not entitled to any deduction from the amount secured by the bond and mortgage, by reason of the deficiency in the quantity of the land. The defendant took several exceptions. The pleadings raised all the issues passed upon. Judgment was entered pursuant to the decision of the referee, and the defendant appealed to the general term.

       "  'case_summary': \"JOSEPH H. NEAL vs. WM. D. HOPKINS. Ejectment—Evidence—Defence of Title in a Third Party—Location of Lines—Dedication of Street—Conflict Between Deed and Contract of Sale. When a party who has a life-estate in a tract of land agrees that the same shall be sold under a bill in equity filed by the remaindermen, and consents to receive in satisfaction a portion of the proceeds of sale, the purchaser of the land under the decree acquires a clear title. If there being any conflict between the provisions of a deed conveying land and the terms of a previously executed contract to convey the same, the deed controls as the last expression of the will of the parties. In an action of ejectment where the question is as to the true location of a line, declarations concerning the same made by one of the parties against his interest are admissible. When defence is taken upon warrant in an action of ejectment, evidence as to where a fence was placed is not admissible, unless the same be located on the plats. Plaintiff conveyed to defendant a tract of land, one line of which was described as beginning on a street which had not been opened but which had been dedicated by the plaintiff by conveyances to other parties. The outlines of the street had not been described by a map. Defendant enclosed his lot but plaintiff contended that in so doing he had not followed the true line of the street and plaintiff sued in ejectment. The chief question was as to the true width and location of the unopened street. Held, that evidence of the acts of persons owning land abutting on the street prior to the date of defendant’s deed was admissible to show what had been dedicated, but that what the plaintiff did after the date of the deed was not competent evidence because it could throw no light on the question as to the location of the street when defendant bought the property. A prayer which allows the jury, in an action of ejectment, to ignore an imperative call in a deed is erroneous. When the place of beginning in a deed is clearly designated, parol evidence as to the understanding of the parties concerning the same is not admissible. The making of a sidewalk and the planting of trees by the owner of land along the line of an unopened and projected street are not in themselves sufficient to establish a dedication of the same, but such facts are admissible in evidence in connection with other circumstances to show a dedication. Appeal from the Circuit Court for Dorchester County (Lloyd, J.) William D. Hopkins, the plaintiff below and the appellee here, sold to Joseph H. Neal a parcel of land lying within the corporate limits of Cambridge. Years previous to such sale a street called Willis street had been opened at right angles to a street called Glasgow street, which it crossed, and was then extended for a short distance, northward, toward the Choptank River. Neal’s lot was near the river, but at the time he purchased the same Willis street had not been extended thereto. Having received a deed from Hopkins, Neal enclosed his lot according to his view of his rights thereunder. In thus enclosing the same Neal placed a fence on the eastward side of his lot, running, as he contends, with the northwestward side or line of Willis street extended to the Choptank River. But Hopkins claims that Neal placed said fence', not on the proper northwestward line or side of Willis street, extended, but on the contrary, that he embraced within his enclosure a strip of land not included within the parcel of land bought by him. Hopkins brought an action of ejectment to recover the same from Neal, and from a judgment in his favor this appeal was taken. In the fifth exception the defendant offered to show that on the day he and the plaintiff bargained for the land described in the said deed between- them, and at the very time that the price was agreed on and the bargain finally struck, the same being on the day before the execution of said deed, the two were standing on the spot marked red letter L on the plat, and the plaintiff, pointing out the lamppost on the north corner of Locust and Willis streets as the point of beginning of the northwest line of Willis street, said that the said line extended to the Choptank River, would, he thought, about cross said spot where they were standing, and that the cedars and ditch, and old gate before them (all delineated on the plat) would certainly be within his, the defendant’s lines, if he bought the lot offered for sale and which is described in said deed, and thereupon the defendant agreed to buy and did buy by the northwest line of Willis street extended, as subsequently embodied in said deed from the plaintiff to the defendant. But the Court refused to permit said testimony to go to the jury, to which refusal the defendant objected. ■The cause was argued before McSherry, C. J., Bryan, Fowler, Briscoe, Page, and Boyd JJ.

For appellant there was a brief over the name of Hicks 6 Davis to this effect. I. The common-law rule as to trespass ought not to be held applicable to the sparsely settled regions of this country. It is to the public interest to condone unintentional trespasses: Powers v. Kindt, 13 Kan. 74 ; Wingrove v. Williams, 6 Kan. App. 262 (51 Pac. 52); Willard v.

Adamson, 76 Iowa, 337 (41 N. W. 34); Lazarus v. Phelps, 152 U. S. 81 (14 Sup. Ct. 477). II. The complaint is fatally defective in that it does not show that the land trespassed upon was inclosed by a lawful fence. This is true of all parts of the State except those expressly excepted by statute: B. & C. Comp. §§ 4334-4340; Campbell v. Bridwell, 5 Or. 311; Walker v.

The measure of damages is the usable value of the land for so many sheep as may have pastured on it during the time complained of: Sutherland, Damages, (2 ed.) §§ 1016, 1017. IV. As it appeared that other persons were grazing cattle on these lands during this time it devolved upon plaintiff to show what proportion of the damage was done by defendant’s sheep: Dooley v.

Morris, 39 Kan. 377 (18 Pac. 230); Sutherland, Damages, (2 ed.) § 444. For respondent there was a brief over the name of John L. Rand to this effect. 1. The act of 1872 is a substitute for the act of 1870 so far as concerns sheep, which leaves the common law in force as to nninclosed land, and now applies strictly to Grant County (Strickland v. Geide, 31 Or. 373, 49 Pac. 982); and the law of 1891 places Grant County under the act of 1872, and does not include sheep: Laws 1891, p. 128; B. & C. Comp. §§ 4341, 4344. 2. In general, the proper measure of damages for the destruction or loss of growing crops is the value of the same standing on the ground, and not the loss measured by the rental value of the land : Byrne v. Minneapolis & St. L. Ry. Go. 38 Minn. 212 (8 Am. St. Rep. 668, 36 N. W. 339); Lommeland v. St. Paul, M. & M. Ry. Co. 35 Minn. 412 (29 N. W. 119); Folsom v. Apple River L. D. Có. 41 Wis. 602; Colorado Consol. L. & W. Co. v. Hartman, 5 Colo. App. 150 (38 Pac. 62). 3. A witness may state his opinion as to the amount of damage in cases of this kind: Watery v. Hiltgen, 16 Wis. 516; Bird v. Chicago & N. W. Ry. Co. 41 Wis. 65; Wood-beck v. Wilders, 18 Cal. 131; Rogers v. Anson, 42 Hun, 436. * See note in 81 Am.

Where plaintiff had contracted with defendant to purchase land, making a down payment and agreeing to make deferred payments, and upon his failure to make the latter the contract was terminated by mutual consent, plaintiff was entitled to a return of the down payment, and defendant who thereafter had sold the land at a higher price than that agreed to be paid by plaintiff was in no position to exact forfeiture of the first payment.

In the absence of a showing of abuse of discretion, refusal to permit defendant to amend his answer for the purpose of pleading the stat-' ute of limitations, held not error, the power to allow or refuse amendments at any stage of the trial being discretionary with the trial judge. Vendor and Purchaser—Cost of Improvements Made Without Consent of Vendor not Becoverable. 4. Where the vendor of land had not requested the purchaser to erect fences thereon, and the contract of purchase was terminated by mutual consent before the land had been fully paid for, it was error, in the purchaser’s action to recover the down payment, to admit testimony concerning the cost of the fence and improper to include its cost in the damages awarded.

Testator owned two adjoining farms, one, on the west, called the “W. Farm, ’’the other, on the east, called the “ H. Farm. ” Plaintiff was put into possession of the former, and defendant into possession of the latter, residing thereon with testator. Soon after defendant went to live with him, testator had a fence built on the east line of the locus in quo, a parcel of land containing about 30 acres, which belonged to and was situated on the west side of the W. farm, whereby that parcel became included in, and was ever after used as, a part of the H. farm. By the sixth clause of his will, testator devised to defendant “ all my said farm situated in the town of Austerlitz, ” etc., “and containing about 140 acres of land, with the appurtenances thereunto belonging, being the farm on which said [defendant] now resides, ” subject to a life-estate given by a previous clause to the testator’s sister, “in the farm of land occupied by” defendant.

The expense of erecting a monument was made a charge equally “against my two said farms, occupied by” plaintiff and defendant. Held, that the testator evidently used the words “resides ” and “ occupied ” in the same sense; that there is a latent ambiguity in regard to the locus in quo; that the trial court erred in holding that the two clauses were in irreconcilable conflict; and that the seventh clause must prevail, as the last expression of the testator’s intention; and in holding that his declarations as to how he had annexed the locus in quo to the H. farm, and his object in so doing, were not admissible to aid in construingthewill, and determininghis testamentary intention in regard to that parcel, in view of the surroundings.

       "  'case_summary': 'Samuel S. Bliss, Respondent, v. Royal L. Johnson et al., Administrators, etc., Appellants. One holding the legal title to lands although not actually occupying, will be considered as constructively in possession thereof, unless they are in the actual hostile occupancy of another under a claim of title. Where the true owner has been dispossessed, if the dispossession terminates within twenty years, the possession will be considered as having returned to him; to defeat his title the adverse possession must be continuous for twenty years. One J.held the legal title to the whole of a highway; S., to whose title plaintiff succeeded, took title, in 1837, to a farm adjoining the highway under a deed which by its terms bounded the lands on the north by the center of the highway ; immediately thereafter S. built a fence extending one rod into the highway, along the entire north line of his farm, and he and his successor in title continued to occupy the inclosed strip under claim of title until 1846, when, upon a survey establishing J’s title to the whole highway the fence was removed back to the south line thereof, and thereafter no part of it was inclosed. From 1867, when plaintiff purchased and took possession, down to 1875,he occupied a strip of land one rod wide adjoining his farm, by plowing, cultivating and mowing it each year. Held, that conceding both of these periods of occupation were hostile in inception and continuous in character and sufficient to initiate a claim to an adverse possession, they did not bar the right of the true owner as there was not a continuous adverse possession for twenty years. During the period between 1846 and 1867, T., plaintiff’s predecessor in title, once a year cut the grass from a small plat of ground in the highway, a row of trees was also planted by him in the highway in 1864, which were within a few years thereafter taken up or destroyed, and he sometimes piled lumber in the highway against his fence. He did not occupy the highway in any other manner. Held, that the evidence failed to establish a claim by adverse possession. The setting out of trees or the building of a sidewalk in a highway by the owner of adjoining lands, as authorized by the act of 1863 (Chap. 93, Laws of 1863), is not such an occupation as can be made the foundation of a claim to title by adverse possession as against the true owner. (Argued November 28, 1883 , decided December 11, 1883.) Appeal from judgment of the General Term of the Supreme Court, in the third judicial department, entered upon an order made September 30, 1881, which affirmed a judgment in favor of plaintiff, entered upon a verdict. This was an action for assault and battery. The defense was that the acts complained of were done by defendants lawfully in defense of their possession. The case is reported upon a prior appeal, in 73 N. Y. 529. It appeared upon the trial that the assault complained of grew out of a controversy between the parties who owned adjoining farms in respect to the right to a quantity of hay, which plaintiff had cut on the south side of the highway adjoining his farm. The hay was left by plaintiff to dry; in his absence defendants went into the highwajr and commenced raking and gathering it into piles for removal, on perceiving which, plaintiff went with his team and wagon to load and carry it away, and the affray then occurred. Defendants claimed that Boyal Johnson, one of the original defendants, who died after verdict, owned the land upon which the hay grew, that it belonged to him and his son, the other defendant, and that the alleged assault was committed in resisting plaintiff’s attempt by force to prevent its removal. The further material facts are stated in the opinion. M. M. Waters for appellants. The title to the highway was a proper subject of inquiry in this action. (Bliss v. Johnson, 73 N. Y. 529.) The legal title to land is presumptive evidence of possession. (Code of Civil Proc., § 368.) If the true owner be in possession of a part of the land, claiming title to the whole, his seizin extends by construction of law to the whole. (3 Wheat. 213; Code of Civil Proc., § 370; Thompson v. Burhance, 79 N. Y. 93.) While a void deed is sufficient to determine the extent of the possession under it, and to base an adverse holding of lands which are vacant, yet, if the true owner be at the same time in possession of a part of the land, claiming title to the whole, then his seizin extends by construction of law to all the laud which is not in the actual possession by inclosure, or otherwise, of the party claiming under the defective title.

J. Montanye for respondent.

The refusal of the court to admit Royal Johnson’s testimony as to the conversations between him and Wattles and Williams’ agent at the time of the giving of the deeds was proper, as it called for transactions between the witness, a party, and plaintiff’s grantor who was dead, or in which plaintiff’s grantor took part.

A statute which does not take away any right nor impose a substantially new duty, but regulates, with additional requirements, a duty imposed by a previous act, is not to be deemed inconsistent with the previous act Thus the provision of the general railroad act, making the section requiring companies to construct fences and gates applicable to preexisting companies, if not inconsistent with their charters, makes it apply to a company whose charter required it to construct fences and left it to the land owners to make gates. The provisions of law requiring railroad companies to fence, &c., are to be regarded not merely as a regulation between land owners, but are to have an extended application as a police regulation for the safety of the public, Philip S. Staats sued defendants, to recover damages for running over Ms horse, which escaped from its pasture, through a gate that was out of repair, upon the track. The company’s charter (L. 1846, c. 216, § 24), contained the following clause: “ Said corporation, before running any cars upon the said railroad, shall erect and thereafter maintain upon the sides thereof ... a fence of such height and strength as is by law required, as a division fence, . . . but this section shall not prevent persons owning or occupying lands adjoining the said road from erecting at proper and convenient places, where they may have occasion for crossing the said road for farming and other necessary purposes, suitable gates in the line of said fence, to facilitate such crossing, and to be kept in repair by the person using the same.” The general railroad law subsequently passed {L. 1850, c. 140, § 44), requires every corporation formed under its provisions “ to erect and maintain fences, . . . with openings or gates or bars therein. . . . Until such fences and cattle guards shall be duly made the corporation and its agents shall be liable for all damages which shall be done by their agents or engines to cattle, horses, or other animals thereon, and after such fences and guards shall be duly made and maintained, the corporation shall not be liable for any such damages, unless negligently or willfully done.” Another section (49) declared all existing railroad companies to be subject to the provisions of this and other sections, not inconsistent with the provisions of their charter. A subsequent act (L. 1854, Oi 383, § 8), contains a clause requiring that “ Every railroad corporation, whose line of road is open for use, shall, within three months after the passage of this act, and every railroad company formed, or to be formed, but whose lines are not now open for use, shall, before the lines of such railroad are opened, erect and thereafter maintain fences on the sides of their roads, . . . with openings or gates or bars therein, at the farm crossings of such railroad, for the use of the proprietors of the. lands adjoining such railroads, and shall also construct, where the same has not already been done, and hereafter maintain, cattle guards at all road crossings. . . . And so long as such fences and cattle guards shall not be made, and when not m good repair, such railroad corporation and its agents shall be liable; . . . . and when such fences and .guards shall have been duly made, and shall be kept in good repair, such railroad corporation shall not be liable for any such damages, unless negligently or willfully done.” The supreme court held, that \"the general acts did not apply to this company.

Defendant having color of title, by a regular chain of conveyances, to the land in controversy (plaintiff being an innocent purchaser from heirs of a patentee, whose deed, a link in defendant’s title, was unrecorded), had no inclosure or improvements thereon, except a garden and dwelling house, rented to a tenant and so occupied for three years before\" suit. In connection with incidental use of the uninclosed portion for grazing purposes (for particulars of which see opinion), such tenant’s occupancy gave the defendant possession to the limits of his deed. (Following Bowles v. Brice, 66 Texas, 724). 2. Same—Possession of Part by Tenant. In the opinion of Justice Key, there should be no distinction between actual possession of part by the claimant himself and that by his tenant, but both should be held to extend by construction to the limits of claimant’s deed, though a sale by the claimant of the part in his actual possession would terminate his constructive possession of the remainder. Appeal from Hays. Tried below before Hon. H. Teichmueller. Wheeless & Harris, for appellant. —1. The court erred in refusing to allow the defendant to prove the nature and value of the improvements he had placed upon the laud in controversy in good faith; and erred in refusing to allow defendant to prove by his vendor, Wolf, the amount he, Wolf, paid in cash for the land in controversy. 2. The same presumptions should prevail in favor of the ancient record of a deed as to its authentication for registration that obtain as to its execution. 3. A deed executed in 1838, being signed by the vendor in the presence of two subscribing witnesses and a notary public, all of whom sign their names officially thereto, and which was in fact recorded in 1846, in the county in which the land conveyed therein was then situated, should he held constructive notice of its existence and contents in 1884.

The court erred in holding that plaintiff is an innocent purchaser of the land in controversy for valuable consideration paid therefor in good faith. 5. The court erred in concluding, as\\'a matter of law, that plaintiff is not barred by limitation from recovering seventeen-thirtieths of the land in controversy. Defendant acquired the land in 1884, under a perfect chain of title, all of which, including the deed to himself, has been properly of record since 1884; and he has paid all taxes ever since 1884. The court holds that plaintiff is entitled to recover seventeen-thirtieths of this land as an innocent purchaser from a portion of the heirs of the original grantee in 1884, after defendant had acquired it. Plaintiff sued defendant for this land in 1886, alleging that defendant was in actual possession of it, holding it adversely to him, but allowed the suit to be dismissed in 1887, under rule for costs. After suit was dismissed, defendant built a house on the land and fenced in a garden in 1887, and placed in said house, as soon as it was completed, his son-in-law, who has lived in said house and cultivated the garden ever since, as defendant’s tenant, being all the while employed by defendant. Furthermore, during all this period defendant kept all stock not his own driven off of this land, and begun preparations for fencing it as early as 1887 or 1888, by purchasing, and placing thereon posts and wire for fencing material. He lived all this time on a tract, also owned by him, joining this tract, on which he had three fields under separate inclosures, two of which were separated by a lane, and one of these and a third field, by a gap about a half mile wide. In the spring of 1890, or 1891, defendant placed a continuous fence around and upon three sides of this land, which fence connected with the inclosures around two of his said fields, respectively, between which was the gap. This gap defendant closed by a fence in the spring of 1892. The fencing was done from time to time, as defendant was able to bear the expense, and wras under construction, part at a time, for a considerable length of time before all the land was completely inclosed by a continuous fence, in the spring of 1892. This suit was filed May 14, 1894. There is no dispute about these facts. The court substantially finds them so; and under them the plaintiff is clearly barred by limitation from recovering any part of this land. The court erred in holding a contrary view; and judgment should have been rendered that plaintiff take nothing by his suit, and pay all costs. Richards v. Smith, 67 Texas, 612; Bowles v.

       "  'case_summary': \"OLIN v HENDERSON. 1. Boundaries — Field-Notes—Ejectment. The field-notes of a United States surveyor upon his survey of the rear concession of a private claim are admissible in evidence in ejectment for land claimed to be a part of the front concession, where the issue is the location of the boundary line between the two concessions, in connection with the field-notes of the front concession by the same surveyor, for the purpose of showing the location of the witness trees, and the fact that, by establishing the line as claimed by the plaintiff, as owner of the front concession, the defendant, as owner of the rear concession, has all the land his patent calls for. 2. Same — Location oe Monuments — Resurvey—Evidence. One who resurveyed a private claim, bounded in front by a river, testified that, finding no old monument near the river, he started from a fence, which he knew to be “very nearly” correct, and found witness trees on the line between the front and rear concessions (the location of which line was the matter in dispute) at a distance of 46 feet less than indicated in the government survey, which discrepancy, he explained, might be due to the varying height of the water in the river. His survey agreed with the government survey in the number of acres in the rear concession. The jury were instructed that the value of the survey as evidence depended upon the correct location of the starting point. Held, that the testimony was not incompetent, nor, in view of the charge, misleading. 3. Same — Hearsay. Testimony of defendant in ejectment concerning statements made by a United States surveyor when defendant built a fence on what he claimed to be the boundary line of his concession, the true location of which line is the matter in issue, is inadmissible, as hearsay, where plaintiff’s grantor, the owner of the adjoining concession, was not present at the interview , 4. Evidence — Facts Equally Within Decedent’s Knowledge-Grantee of Heir. '3 How. Stat. § 7545, as amended by Act No. 121, Pub. Acts 1895, providing that in a suit prosecuted or defended by the heirs, assigns, devisees, legatees, or personal representatives of a deceased person, the opposite party shall be incompetent to testify to facts equally within decedent’s knowledge, excludes such testimony where the suit is prosecuted by a remote grantee of decedent’s heirs. • 5. Ejectment — Right to Maintain. One in possession of land under an executory contract of sale may maintain ejectment against a trespasser. 6. Same — Proof of Possession — Appeal — Objections not Raised Below. Where defendant in ejectment permits the trial to proceed upon an evident understanding that plaintiff’s possession under a contract giving the right to such possession is conceded, his objection, raised for the first time on appeal, that the proof of possession is insufficient, will not be considered. 7. Same — Declaration—Allegation of Title. Under 2' How. Stat. § 7790, providing that plaintiff in ejectment must show a valid subsisting interest in the premises, and the right to, recover the possession thereof, and section 7797, providing that the declaration shall state whether plaintiff claims in fee, or for life, or for a term of years, or otherwise, it is sufficient for one in possession under an executory contract of sale to allege title in fee, without setting up the contract. 8. Boundaries — Agreement and Acquiescence. To establish a boundary line by agreement and acquiescence, not only must there have been an express agreement, and monuments erected and acquiesced in, but a doubt or controversy must have existed as to the true line; otherwise, the statute (2 How. Stat. § 6179) prohibiting the conveyance of real estate by parol renders the agreement inoperative. Error to Wayne; Hosmer, J. Submitted January 27, 1899. Decided May 9, 1899. Ejectment by Rollin C. Olin and Oscar Le Seure against Thomas Henderson. From a judgment for plaintiffs,' defendant brings error. Affirmed. This is an action of ejectment for the recovery of “a parcel of land, 19 rods wide, at the rear of the front concession of private claim No. 259, and being the southerly part of said front concession,” containing 2^ acres, which plaintiffs claim'in fee. The situation will appear from the following plat: The land in dispute is marked with a cross. Plaintiffs introduced the original patent for private claim 259, and deeds which brought the title to Francis F. Palms and others. These parties gave a land contract for the sale of this front concession to Edward T. Adams, trustee, which was by him assigned to plaintiffs, July 28, 1892. This contract, among other descriptions, covers “ all that part of the front concession of said private claim 259 lying southwesterly of the road crossing about the center of the length of said front concession of said private claim 259, said parcel to include all lands from the center of said road or highway to the extreme rear of said front concession, and containing 35 acres more or less, except a strip owned or occupied by the Wabash, St. Louis & Pacific Railway Company. ” This was the ordinary land contract, and contained the following provision in regard to possession : “ In the event of said second party taking or assuming possession of said premises, in case of such default, said first parties may treat him as a tenant at will, and take the usual summary proceedings before a circuit court commissioner or justice of the peace to eject and remove him from such premises.” The plea was the general issue. The dispute arises over' the boundary line between the front and rear concessions. Defendant’s contention is thus stated by his counsel: “ (1) That neither plaintiffs nor their grantors made or proved a claim to anything beyond the rear line of the front concession, which is only 80 acres from the border of the river, and that, by going up to defendant’s fence, they had already gone beyond' their said rear line, and. had more land than they even claimed, and the disputed strip was no part of their tract. * * * “(2) That the contract gives plaintiffs no title in fee, which is what their declaration claims, but is simply an agreement to sell, which provides that, under certain circumstances, they may become tenants at will of the owners; that it gives them no right of possession; and that, as a matter of fact, it does not appear that they have ever taken possession under it of any part of the front concession, and therefore that they have never even become such tenants. ‘ ‘ (3) That neither plaintiffs nor their grantors have ever been in possession of the disputed strip. ‘ ‘ (4) That the testimony of the surveyors shows that they were not governed by the original survey of this land in making their surveys. * ■* * “ (5) That defendant and those claiming under him had been in the undisturbed possession of that disputed land for more than 15 years, claiming to own it. “(6) That defendant and Dennis J. Campau, when they were owners of these adjoining pieces o'f land, had established and agreed upon a line between them, and that it had bpen acquiesced in for* many years, and was thus made the true line, independently of the fact that it was or was not the true line.” Two questions were submitted to the jury: (1) Where was the original line ? (2) Has defendant acquired title by adverse possession ? The issue was found in favor of the plaintiffs. B. T. Prentis, for appellant.

       "  'case_summary': \"COURT OF APPEALS. Wray, respondent, agt. Rhinelander, exr., &c., appellant. Cocks, respondent, agt. same appellant. Where a lease is given for twenty-one years, under and in conformity to a covenant contained in a previous lease of the same premises for a similar term, the second lease being given to the owner of the first lease, and containing covenants that the lessee, on the last day of the term, or other sooner determination of the estate thereby granted, should deliver up the premises “ within good and sufficient fence,” and also the further covenant that the lessors should, at the expiration of such renewal lease, either grant a new lease of the premises thereby demised, for the further term of twenty-one years then next ensuing at such rent as should be determined, &c., &c., or “ pay unto the lessee, his executors, administrators, or assigns, the value in good and lawful money of all such stone and brick buildings as may have been erected by the lessee, his personal representatives, or assigns, on the demised premises and be then standing thereon;” and it was also therein provided how the rent and the value of the buildings were to be ascertained, and it was declared that the new lease, if one was given, should contain like covenants and conditions as were contained in that of the said renewed lease, except only so far as regards a further renewal of the said lease, or the payment of the value of.any buildings erected and standing on the premises, and instead thereof should contain a provision that “all such stone and brick buildings shall be deemed the property of the lessee, &c., who should he at liberty within ten days after the expiration of the term, but not afterwards,” to take down, remove, and carry away, and move off of said premises, all such stone and brick buildings and the material thereof, leaving the said premises inclosed within good and sufficient fence, as aforesaid. In such a lease, where it appeared that during the first term the land had already been improved with buildings of the description for which compensation was provided, it cannot reasonably be inferred that the parties contemplated their destruction and the erection of new buildings during the extended term. The words “all such stone and brick buildings as may have been erected by the said party of the second part, &c., &c., on the demised premises, and he then standing thereon,” does not limit the provisions to buildings to be subsequently erected. The words “ may have been erected” would apply as well to those buildings which were built before the second lease, as to those which were built after the second lease was given. The lessee in the second lease, even though he may not be the same party to whom the first lease was given, yet if he were the assignee of the first lease, and took the second lease before the expiration of the first lease, he comes within the provisions of the covenant in question as the “ party of the second part.” So far as the owner of the premises is concerned, it is a matter of no importance to him whether the buildings iu question were erected by the first lesee or by his assignee. The rational interpretation of the above covenant includes all such improvements (stone and brick buildings) as are actually upon the premises at the expiration of ihe.second term. (Mason, J. dissenting.) Per Mason, J. dissenting.—An enlargement of the buildings made during the second term, would be an erection coming within the terms of the covenant in question, and would entitle the owner of the second lease to payment therefor. Heard together at April term, 1869, and decided together at July term, 1869. In the case of Wray, the special term of the supreme court (Clerks, J.) rendered judgment for the defendant, but the general term on appeal reversed it, and granted a new trial. From such order granting a new trial, the defendant appealed to this court and gave the stipulation under subdivision 2 of $ 11 of the Code. In the case of Cocks, which was in the superior court, a verdict was rendered for the plaintiffs by the direction of the late chief justice Robertson—the exceptions to be heard, in the first instance, at the general term—judgment in the mean timé suspended. The general term of the superior court ordered judgment on the verdict, and from such judgment appeal was taken to this court. In the case of Wray, the facts were these: William Rhinelander, by indenture, of lease, dated May 1, 1824, leased to Ward B. Howard certain premises in the city of New York, for the term of twenty-one years from the date of the lease, at the rent of $400 per annum, the lessee covenanting to pay all taxes, and at the end of said term of twenty-one years, quietly and peaceably to leave, surrender and yield up the said premises to the party of the first part, his heirs or assigns. The lease contained an agreement as follows: “And it is hereby further mutually agreed by and between the parties to these presents, for themselves, their heirs and assigns, that at the expiration of the above term of twenty-one years, the said party of the first part, his heirs or assigns, shall and will, at his or their election, either grant .a new lease of the hereby demised premises for the further term of twenty-one years, upon such increase of rent as shall be agreed on, &c., or he or they will pay unto the said party of the second part, his executors, administrators, or assigns, the value in good and lawful money of the United States of America, of all such stone or brick buildings as shall have been erected on the said hereby demised premises by the said party of the second part, his executors, administrators, or assigns.” A provision was then made for determining such value by arbitrators; and it was then provided, that “ within ten days after notice of such appraisement, the party of the first part, his heirs, or assigns, shall make his or their election, either to grant a new lease, or to pay the value of the said buildings.” Certain brick buildings were erected on the premises by the first lessee, and subsequently the plaintiff became assignee of the lease. William Rhinelander died, and the defendant succeeded to the estate as executor and trustee under his will. In 1844, a year before the termination of the. lease, the plaintiff, intending to go to Europe for a protracted absence, desired the defendant to have the appraisement made then, instead of the timé named in the lease, and to make his election whether he would give a new lease, or pay for the buildings, so that the plaintiff might have this matter settled before his departure. The defendant replied in substance, that he would make his election then, and would give him a new lease for twenty-one years, at the rent of $900. To this the plaintiff agreed, and the defendant executed a lease to the plaintiff, bearing date March 1, 1S44. This lease was also executed by the plaintiff, and was immediately placed upon record. The plaintiff subsequently changed his mind, and did not go to Europe, but remained here in possession of the premises, paying rent therefor, until the end of this lease, May 1, 1866, when the defendant, having elected not to give another lease, took possession of the premises and leased them to other parties. The lease given by the defendant to the plaintiff, March 1, 1844, was a lease for twenty-one years, and contained a covenant “that at the expiration thereof, the defendant, his successors, or the persons entitled to reversion of the estate, will at their election, either give a new lease for twenty-one years,” (then follows an enumeration of covenants to be contained in such lease if given,) “or will pay to the partyof the second part, his executors, administrators or assigns, the value of such stone or brick buildings as may have teen erected hy the said party of the second part, his executors, administrators or assigns, on the said demised premises, and he then standing thereonand provision is made for ascertaing values by appraisement. It turned that no buildings whatever, had been erected on the premises during the term of the second lease; the only buildings thereon, being those which had been erected during the first lease, which terminated in 1845. Subsequently, Mr. Ray brought his action to have the lease, which had been executed in 1844, reformed by striking out from the election covenant the words limiting payment to buildings erected by the plaintiff, his executors, administrators or assigns, and for damages in case of such reformation, so as to entile him to recover the value of the buildings which had been erected under the first lease. He based his claim for reformation upon a statement made by a clerk of defendant’s, and upon supposed legal effect of the lease which he claimed, was to entitle him to be paid for buildings which had been erected upon the premises during the first lease. In the case of Cocks the facts were these: On July 1st, 1825, Loring & Le Foy leased of the defendant’s testator, William Rhinelander, the vacant lots, in the city of New York, now known as Numbers 162 & 163, West street, for the period of two years and ten months, at the rent of $300 payable quarterly. The lessees therein covenanted,'at the expiration of their term, to leave the said lots within good and sufficient fence. This lease, also contained the following covenant: “ And it is hereby further mutually agreed and covenanted by and between the parties to these presents aforesaid, that in case no agreement shall be made between them for a further or new lease of the said premises, on or previously to the time of three months before the expiration of the term hereby demised, nor any agreement for the improvements made thereon, that then it shall and may be lawful for the said party of the second part, executors, administrators, or assigns, to remove and talce of all buildings which may have been erected on said premises by the said party of the second part, executors, administrators, or assigns, Sc.” This lease was acknowledged and recorded on the same day; also the same parties, leased of the defendant’s testator the same premises for the term of eighteen years, commencing at the expiration of the previous lease, at the rent of $400, payable quarterly. This lease contained the following covenant, viz.: uThat at the expiration of the said term hereby granted, the said party of the first part, his heirs or assigns, shall and will, at his or their election, either grant a new lease of the said hereby demised lot or parcel of land, for the further term of twenty-one years therein next ensuing, unto the said parties of the second part, their executors, administrators, or assigns, upon such increase of rent, as shall be agreed on by two indifferent persons, one of which persons to be appointed by the said party of the first part, his heirs or assigns, and the other by the said parties of the second part, their executors, administrators, or assigns; and in case of disagreement, (the covenant contains a clause of umpirage,) he or they will pay unto the said parties of the second part, their executors, administrators, or assigns, the value, in good and lawful money of the United States, of such stone and brick buildings as have been, or may hereafter be erected on the said demised premises by the said parties of the second part, their executors, administrators, or assigns.” The covenant then provides as to the mode of fixing such value, to wit, by two appraisers, and by umpirage in case of disagreement, and that they shall be appointed at a time hot less than three months before the expiration of the then demise. That the appraisers and umpire shall make their returns of the rent so fixed, and also of the value of the buildings, unto both parties. And then the covenant provides further: “ And such return having been made, the said party of the first party his heirs or assigns, shall within ten days thereafter, make his or their election, either to grant a new lease AS AFORESAID, 01' to PAT THE VALUE OF THE SAID BUILDINGS as aforesaid, and notify the same unto the said parties of the second part, their executors, administrators, or assigns, and the same shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties to these presents, and upon all others interested or concerned therein.” After various mesne conveyances the said leases became the property of Hester Le Foy; she dying, Elisha Morrill received letters of administration with the will annexed on her estate. A litigation ensuing with regard to her property, a decree there was made by the assistant vice chancellor of the first circuit, in which among other things, it was ordered that Mr. Morrill, be empowered as receiver to renew the lease of said two stores, (i. e., the premises in question,) according to the covenant of renewal, and upon such terms as he may deem just, subject to the approval of said court, such renewal to be made in his name as receiver. Under and in pursuance of this authority, Elisha Morrill, as trustee of the estate of Abraham Le Foy and Hester Le Foy, deceased, took the lease in question from the present defendant, as surviving executor of the last will and testament, and trustee of the estate of William Ehinelander. By this lease, which was for twenty-one years, from May 1st, 1846, the present appellant leased the lot in question to said Morrill, as trustee, describing the lots as the same parcel of ground as was leased by William Ehinelander to Josephus B. Boring and Abraham Le Foy, for the term of eighteen years from the first day of May, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-eight, at the annual rent of $800. The Morrill lease contained substantially and almost literally the same covenants as in the lease of Wray. This lease was executed by the appellant as executor and trustee, and by Elisha Morrill as receiver. Mr. Rhinelander consented that Mr. Morrill, the receiver, as lessee, might assign the lease over, which he did. By various mesne conveyances, the lease was severed, and the plaintiff, Cocks, became owner of the house No. 163, West street, and thereafter, the landlord, treated the lease as severed, and accepted from the owner of one lease, $400 for rent of 162, West street, and from Cocks, $400 for rent of 163, West street. In January, 1867, the landlord nominated his appraiser, and the two tenants of the two houses nominated one appraiser. The two appraisers, on the 30th April, 1867, agreed upon a report, finding the value of each building at $2,750, and the rent for each building, $750. On the same day the landlord gave the two tenants notice that he elected not to grant a new lease, but to pay “the value of any stone or brick buildings which have been erected on the said premises by the said lessee, or his assigns during the term of the said lease.” Oh the.30th April, 1867, the last day of the term, Mr. Cocks was served with this notice of election. On the next day, being confined to his own house by illness, he-sent his son to the defendant’s office, to receive the value of the buildings. An interview took place with one Patón, wtioclaimed to be defendant’s agent. “I told Mr. Baton, that I came there to receive the value of the buildings ; he said: that Mr. Rhinelander could not pay the value of the buildings-until after the property had been examined—the title—foseé if anything was against the property. I asked him how long it would take to have the property examined; he said about ten days or two weeks. I then said, “Mr. Patón, will you pay for the value of the buildings after you have examined the property ?” said he, “ certainly, we will.” I then called there about three weeks after that, and said, I had again called to receive the value of the buildings. He said Mr. Rhinelander had determined not to pay for the value of the buildings, and referred the witness to the lawyer for the estate.” On May 1st, 1867, the landlord took possession of the builings, and rented them out to other parties, who have been in possession ever since. The reason the witness applied to Patón, was because the defendant, prior to May 1st, 1867, referred him to said Patón, as his agent j said that Mr. Patón would tend to the business, which he did ever after that. On the trial, the plaintiff Cocks, proved he always kept the premises in repair, and made extensive repairs, and furnished an expensive and valuable lamp, which was fixed into the wall of the front, and was taken possession of by the landlord. The landlord made no repairs whatever. The defendant made a motion to dismiss the complaint, on the ground that the plaintiff Cocks, had shown no cause of action. This was denied, and he excepted. This motion was subsequently renewed after all the evidence was in, but was denied. Defendant excepted. The defendant asked the court to charge the jury that the defendant was entitled to a verdict. Denied, and exception. The defendant, also excepted to the introduction of the interview with Patón, as testified to by the witness, and requested the court to charge that there is no evidence of any authority to Patón, to make a promise to charge the estate, and that the statement made does not amount to a promise. Request denied, defendant excepted. The court directed the jury to render a verdict for plaintiff Cocks, for the value of the premises, as admitted, with in terest, in all $2,951 52-100. These two appeals were argued together. H. H. Anderson, for the Rhinelander estate. S. P. Hash, for Stephen Wray. Dennis McMahon, for Codes, and others.\",\n",

Where a railroad company, in the construction of its road, erected an embankment leading to a bridge over a stream, whereby the natural channel of the stream was considerably contracted, and plaintiff’s lands became liable to frequent overflows, but were not made entirely useless for agricultural purposes, being cultivated with varying results each year, and the damages such as could have been apportioned from time to time: Held, 1. It was the duty of the railroad to so construct its road that a sufficient space should be left for the discharge of the water through its accustomed channel, whether artificial or natural, and this duty is a continuing one. 2. It was not contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff to continue planting crops on the lands so subject to overflow. [JEmry v. Railroad, 109 N. C., 598, distinguished). 3. The delay of the plaintiff for a period less than twenty years to notify the company of his injuries, could not estop him or give the company a prescriptive right to maintain the embankment without liability for damages. Civil action, tried at Edgecombe Superior Court, Spring Term, 1892, Brown, J., presiding, to recover damages from flooding land. The plaintiff testified in substance: The lands lie right on Conetoe creek, and are known as the “ Hopkins place.” I have known Conetoe creek since 1872. The railroad embankment was originally constructed in 1869; a portion of it washed away immediately after it was built, and it was rebuilt in 1882. The creek at the railroad is seven hundred and twenty yards wide; the average height of the railroad embankment across it is about four and one-half feet, in some places five feet. One hundred and thirty-six yards (of the stream) is entirely cut off by the railroad embankment. Prior to the railroad embankment, it was seldom the water got over the land; it had one hundred and thirty-six yards more to run off in. When it was running over the county road it ponded water very little on my land, only on the lowest parts of it. Prior to the building of the railroad we never had any water, and I never heard of such a thing. We never failed to make a good crop before the railroad. My experience since the building of the railroad in 1882 is that we have been more or less troubled with water every year. Since the building of the railroad I have seen at least one-half of my land flooded; it could not have been caused by the county dam. Free from the interference of the overflow, and a fair crop season, my land yields a bale of cotton to the acre. My damage in 1888 was $1,000. After the railroad was built, in 1882,1 never made another fair crop. We have had trouble with water ever since 1883. Ever since the construction of the railroad I have been troubled with water, more or less; this same dam of which I now complain has ponded it back on me. Before the railroad was constructed, in 1882, the water ran off my land in twenty-four hours in a wet spell. In 1889 it did not run off. Generally, it takes from ten to fifteen days. This did not occur so every year, but it did occur in 1887,1888 and 1889. I took no action on account of this damage until March, 1890. Ordinary and usual rains will pond my land by reason of the railroad; it would not take an extraordinary rain to do it; heavy rains pond the water. My cultivated land is right on the creek — ten* feet of the creek. I very readilv detected the damage done by tbe railroad embankment. The creek has very little fall, about as little as any I am acquainted with; it is a broad, flat low ground. We made a tolerably good crop in 1883; 1884 was dry, and we made a tolerably good crop; 1885 was a wet year. We had a freshet in June; after that we had no big rains. In 1886 we had a freshet the last of May. We kept on planting in 1887, 1888 and 1889 as long as the season would permit planting. There was other testimony offered by plaintiff in support of his evidence. The defendant introduced no testimony. Among other instructions, the defendant prayed the Court to instruct the jury that, upon the plaintiff’s testimony, he is not entitled to recover in this action Refused. Exception by the defendant. \" * The defendant moved, at the close of the evidence, for judgment, upon the ground that the plaintiff’s own evidence showed contributory negligence, and that the action be dismissed. Motion denied. Exception by the defendant. Among other things, the Court instructed the jury as follows: “The third issue relates to what the law calls contributory negligence, and the Court is of the opinion, after careful consideration, that the evidence is not sufficient to show contributory negligence, therefore the Court instructs you to answer the third issue, No.” The jury rendered their verdict, finding all issues for the plaintiff, and from the judgment rendered thereon the defendant appealed.

Payment of taxes on land for twenty-four successive years by the-party in possession is powerful evidence of the claim of right to the whole lot upon which the taxes were paid, and it is some evidence that the possesion was under a claim of right and was. adverse. 4.

Appeal from the chancery court of Harrison county.\\' IloN. W. M. DeNNy, Je., Chancellor. Suit by F. W. Elmer and others against Native Lumber Company and others. From a decree for complainants, respondents appeal. The facts are fully stated in the opinion of the court. White & Ford for appellants. The principles of law dealing with acquisition of title to real estate by adverse possession are well established and generally recognized. There must be actual adverse possession for the statutory period of ten years, under a claim of right, either by occupancy of the entire tract, or, by occupancy of a part under color of title, to the whole tract. Actual residence upon the land is not required, hut if that test were applied to this case, the proof’does not fail-to supply the requirement. It cannot he doubted that Eichard Deveraux and at least four families of relatives settled upon that part of the land lying east of Ichouticabouffa River, establishing houses there, and actually living upon the land until 1873. During this time Eichard Deveraux claimed the entire tract under an unrecorded deed from Jacob Elmer. The authorities in Mississippi hold uniformly •that even a parol contract of sale for real estate will afford color of title against the vendor or those claiming under him, for example, his heirs, as in this case. The latest announcement of the rule is contained in this case of, Brooks Scanlon Lumber Go. v. Childs, 113 Miss. p. 246, at page 253 of the opinion rendered by Justice Sykes. The court said: “In this state this court has recognized parol color of title of a vendee as against bis vendor and those claiming under him. When a vendor puts his vendee in possession of the land under a parol sale, he knows the limit and the claim of the vendee to this land. As to him it is unnecessary that ’there\\' should be a visible actual occupation of the entire tract, because of his actual knowledge of the claim of •ownership.” A fortiori, the vendor would know the extent of the claim, in case of an unrecorded deed. The principle announced in this decision has several times been applied in Mississippi, as shown by the following cases: Niles v. Davis, 60 Miss. p. 750; Davis v. Davis, 68 Miss. p. 478; Magee v. Magee, 37 Miss. p. 138. It is well established that an unrecorded deed gives color of title to possession thereunder. This principle is generally recognized. See Lee v. Polk County Cooper Co., 62 U. S. Sup. Ct. 493; Winston v. Prevost, 6 L. Ed. 164; Minot v. Brooks, 16 N. H. 374; Ring v. Gray, 45, Ky. p. 638; New Market Mfg. Co. v. Pender-gast, 24 N. H. p. 54. See case of Crowder v. Neal, 100 Miss. 730. This case holds squarely that the fact of another owning land within the enclosure will not prevent the ■occupancy from being adverse arid the statute of limitation from running. See also case of Moran v. Moseley, 164 S. W. 1093, holding: “It is not necessary to title by adverse possession that the land be separately enclosed, but it is sufficient if it is within a general enclosure. The leading case of Caruth v. Gillespie, 109 Miss, p. 679, far weaker in its facts that this, strongly supports our contention here, . The authorities might be multiplied on this question, but we deem the foregoing sufficient. The next question arising from the facts shown by the record\\'is whether or not a conveyance of these lands from Jacob Elmer to Richard Devera/ux is shown. On this point, there is not the slightest controversy, in proof as to what actually happened. The only matter to be discussed is. whether the proof was sufficient to established the deed. On the assessment roll of 1886, appears a notation that the land was purchased from Jacob Elmer by Richard Deveraux, and the assessment was changed for that year from Elmer to Deveraux. For fifty-one years after the trade with Deveraux, the taxes were paid by Deveraux and his successors in title, and it was not until a meddling abstractor, more than a half century .afterwards, discovered by accident and called to ap-pellee’s attention the break in the title, that we hear of any claim made to\\' the land by Elmer, or his decendants. The next proposition- involved in this record is whether the law will presume a grant from Elmer to Deveraux under the facts shown by the proof. Of course this question is closely allied to that of adverse possession, and it might with propriety have been considered along with that phase of the case, but we prefer to treat it separately. We shall not burden the court with a multitude of authority, but shall cite a few selected cases. Hewling v. Blake, 110 Miss. p. 225; Caruth v. Gillespie, 109 Miss. p. 679; Nixon’s Heirs v. Careo’s Heirs, 28 Miss. 414; Stephenson’s Hevrs v. McRearg, 13* S. &• M. 9; United States v. Chaves, 44 L. Ed. 255. The will of ■Jacob Elmer (shown at page 30 of this transcript), -shows a complete adandonment of claim to any lands in Harrison County outside the city of Biloxi. The testator says: “I give, devise and bequeath all the estate, real and personal, which it has pleased God to bless me with as follows to wit:” . In conclusion we submit that the title of appellants to the land had become complete by adverse possession long before the suit was filed. In the case of Geogehan v. Marshall, 66 Miss. 676, the court held that it is not necessary for the adverse possession to continue during the ■ whole time from the beginning of the claim to the date of suit, but it is sufficient if there be ten years continuous .adverse occupancy at any period before suit is filed. We submit confidently that the proof shows that a deed was executed by Jacob Elmer to Deveraux, and certainly the law will presume a grant in the presence of proof so strong and convincing. W. E. Morse and J. M. Morse, for appellee. To constitute adverse possession there must be open exclusive, hostile, and notoriQus possession as against the whole world. If the facts do not bring the case within this rule then it is not adverse possession. We will, therefore, take up the different acts relied upon and study them more in detail to see whether or not they constitute adverse possession. The Deveraux family took this land under-a claim of right. They were in truth and in fact mere trespassers; they did not even take under color of title; therefore if any action of theirs was sufficient to constitute adverse possession, then it would only attach to that particular part of the land which they had in their immediate possession. Our state court has held: “One entering land without color of title is limited to possessio pendis.” Niles v. Davis, 60 Miss. 755; Ryan v. M. V. Ry., 62 Miss,\\'162; Chastang v. Chastang, 37 So. 799; 10 E. C.*L. Adverse Possession, sec. 42, says: “It has been established by the great weight of authority that the rights of those who enter upon the land as mere trespassers, that is, without color of title, will be confined to that portion of the property which was subject to> their actual possession.” But says the appellants, that the Devereaux family burned charcoal over most of the land, and cut down a great deal of the timber upon the same. We still say that they would be limited to the particular portion that they lived upon. But say that it did not; say that their claim extended to the entire tract of four hundred acres. Even then, the acts of the Devereaux would not be sufficient to constitute adverse possession, for the proposition that the cutting of timber and other slight acts of trespass will not support the contention of adverse possession. See Stevens Lbr. Co. v. Hughes, 38 So. 769; See, also, Leavenworth v. Reeves, 64 So. 660, 2 C. J. p. 64. Yet granting every contention made by appellants as to the acts of the Devereaux family, that they held adverse to Elmer; that they held the entire four hundred acres on account of having burnt charcoal over some of it and having cut some timber from the land, still the time which they held the property was only for seven years, and if there was to be any adverse possession it had to arrive under the holding of Krohn, because there was an abandonment of their claim when they \\' moved off the property, for the reason that they had no color of title, they were holding as mere trespassers, moved off the property. For the reason that they had no See Harper v. Tapley, 35 Miss. 506. The only other claim advanced by the appellants was that they paid taxes, they seemed to put a great deal of stress upon this point. This is a good question upon which to cite authorities for in our case, but the following are only a few of the cases upon this subject. Kennedy v. Saunders. 90 Miss. 542; Leavenworth v. Reeves, 64 So. 660; 19 R. C. L. On the subject of adverse possession, par 12: In proving a claim of title by adverse possession it is competent to introduce evidence showing the payment of taxes by the claimant on the property involved for all, or a part of the time, it was in his possession. Such evidence is to be con sidered by the jury in connection with other in the case,\\' but is not of itself sufficient to establish adverse-possession.” For other cases covering this identical point see: Ewing v. Burnett, Fed. Cas. 1; McLean 266; Brown v.. Bacquenne, 57 Ark. 89, 20 S. W. 813; Ballenger v. Cauteau, 20 Mo. 89; Cashman v. Cashman, 50 Mo. App. 663; Motley v. Bruders, 86 N. C. 251; Reed v. Field, 15 S. W. 672; McCaughn v. Young, 85 Miss. 287. Taking all of the acts of adverse possession relied upon by the appellants and we have an insufficient possession to constitute adverse possession as required by the law in our state. Kennedy v. Saunders, 90 Miss. 543; Colin v. Smith. 94 Miss. 519. Appellees show an unbroken chain of tax receipts for thirty-seven years; having paid the taxes on the land every year since 1872. The land is not susceptible of actual occupancy and cultivation. It is shown that the father of two of the appellees claimed the land in his lifetime, that he had it posted to keep off the trespassers; used the timber on it, such as he needed for fencing and firewood. In. other words, he exercised such acts of possession and control of the land as he exercised over any other-land claimed and owned by him. He not only paid the taxes \\' on the land but gave mortgages or deeds of trust on it just as he would any other property owned by him. The appellee contends that the deed which Smith received from the state gave color of title to the land in controversy. Judge SidNey Smith delivered the opinion: “The-evidence of the court below discloses a perfect record title in the appellant to the land in controversy; but the chancellor held that the appellees were the owners, thereof by adverse possession. There was evidence of claim of ownership on the part of the appellant, but no evidence amounting .to proof of possession. At most it showed nothing more than a mere ‘scrambling possession,’ which is hot sufficient to cause title to vest hy adverse possession. The decree of the court is therefore reversed and the hill dismissed.” For other Mississippi cases on this, see McGehee v. McGehee, 37 Miss. 151; Huntington v. Allen, 44 Miss. 668; Stephens Lbr. Go. v. Hughes, 38 So. 769; Leavensworth v. Beeves, 64 So. 660; Dedeauoc- v. Delisle Lbr. Co., 73 So. 53. It is manifestly unnecessary to cite authorities from other states when our courts have so thoroughly gone-into this subject and have. rightfully decided the principle. The cases cited by appellants, Hewling v. Blalce, 110 Miss. 225; Carulh v. Gillespie, 10-9 Miss. 679, in support of a presumption of a lost deed do not apply, for in these cases the successful parties had been in the actual possession of the land for longer than ten years under color of title and the only reason the cases were in court was that the state was interested in the title of the land, or had shortly owned the title which stopped the statute of limitation from running. We think that the decision of the lower court was. eminently proper, both on the law and upon the facts.',\n",

Contributory Negligence — Sufficient Allegations of.—Plaintiff sued appellant company for damages for depredations on his crops by stock, which entered his premises over the depot platform, which was partly within and partly outside his enclosure, and was not protected by cattle guard or otherwise. Defendant's plea of contributory negligence was, that the plaintiff, by building a few yards of fence around defendant’s passenger depot, could have prevented all the damages. This plea was good against a general demurrer, and the court below erred in striking it out on plaintiff’s exception. 2. Cattle Guards.—The platform extends about four feet inside the pasture, and the track is outside. The statute with reference to cattle guards would not be applicable in such a case, and it was not shown by the evidence to be applicable. 3. Allegation and Proof — Damages. — The amount of damages found by the court is clearly excessive. Plaintiff could not recover more for any particular item of damages than he alleges in his petition he sustained; and when the allegation was that his pasture had been damaged $50, he could not recover more than that sum by proof of $200 or $300 damage to it. 4.

Where executors sold land of their testator, but only one of them executed the deed, and the grantee went into possession, a right of action in ejectment accrued at once in their favor,- and limitations began to run against them, under Code Civ. Proc. § 415, from that time. 3. Same—Power oe Sale—Trust. Where a testator left property in trust to his executors, to sell it and pay the income from investment of the proceeds to his wife, as long as she should remain his widow, for the support of his infant children during their minority, the trust thereby created was for the benefit of the infants, and not of the widow. 4. Same—Limitations. Where executors hold the legal title to land in trust for minors, the period in which limitations run against the executors as to an action for possession of the land should be counted, in determining whether the action is barred; and if it, in connection with the period elapsing after the infants reach majority, makes more than 20 years, the action is barred. 5. Same. Where executors holding land in trust for infants make a void deed thereof, and the grantee takes possession, if the executors do not continue to hold the legal title the infants may at once maintain an action for the land; and, under limitations provided by Code Civ. Proc. §§ 365, 375, the action cannot be maintained when the grantee has been in possession more than 20 years in all, and more than 10 years after the infants reached majority. 6. Adverse Possession—Substantial Inclosure. Where plaintiff, claiming title to a lot, incloses it on three sides with a fence, so that it makes a complete inclosure in connection with an adjoining lot, the owner of which makes no claim to the first lot, but has given his individual covenant of quiet enjoyment in an executor’s deed thereof, there is a substantial inclosure of the lot, within Code Civ. Proc. §§ 370, 372, providing that such an inclosure constitutes adverse possession. 1f 1. See Executors and Administrators, vol. 22, Cent. Dig. § 505. Appeal from Judgment on Report of Referee.

       "  'case_summary': \"REYNOLDS, ET AL, vs CLOWDUS, ET AL Opinion delivered September 23, 1903. 1. Indian Lands — Ejectment—Instructions. It was not error for the court to instruct the jury, in an action of ejectment, that the defendant was entitled to a judgment if he showed a better title than plaintiff, notwithstanding the rule that plaintiffs, in such an action, must recover on the strength of their own title, where both parties claim title from a common source. 2. Indian Lands — Ejectment—Title—Parol Proof — Instructions. In an action of ejectment for possession of indian lands the defendant alleged abandonment by the plaintiff’s grantor prior to the transfer to plaintiff, and that a verbal gift of all his rights was, at the same time, made by plaintiff’s grantor to defendant. The evidence was conflicting. , Held, that it was not error for the court to instruct the jury that defendant could not recover unless they found he had an equal title or a conveyance from somebody who had a better title than plaintiff, provided they found plaintiff to have a regular chain of title from the original owners. And, Held, that such instruction, if erroneous, was not prejudicial to defendant. 3. Ejectment — Abandonment—Gift—Instructions. In an action of ejectment, an instruction, asked by defendant, that if plaintiff or those through whom he claimed, had abandoned the land or given same to defendant or agreed on a boundary line with defendant, then plaintiff cannot recover, is entirely too broad; for plaintiff’s grantor could have done only one of these-things, not both. 4. Ejectment — Title—Verbal Gift — Parol Proof. In an action of ejectment, a verbal transfer of the premises sought to be established by parol proof, constituted no good defense. A verbgl transfer of the premises is void; and a legal title to land cannot be proved by parol evidence. 5. Indian Lands — Title—Gift Unaccompanied by Possession Confers np Eights. Although a Choctaw citizen might put another citizen in possession of lands, in possession of and segregated from public domain by the former, and thereby make a valid gift good as against the grantor and the world; but where possession is not taken by the donee, and is afterwards resisted by the donor, the donee acquires no rights in the premises. Appeal from the United States Court for the Southern District. Hosea Townsend, Judge. Ejectment by S. A. Clowdus and others against M. C. Reynolds and others. Judgment for plaintiffs. Defendants appeal. Affirmed. This is an action of ejectment brought by S. A. Clowdus and others against M. C. Reynolds and others. The plaintiffs in this action, though citizens of the Chickasaw Nation, claim to have purchased this land from one O. W. Seay on the 19th day of September, 1898, by a written bill of sale therefor; that the defendants were in the unlawful possession for one year previous to the beginning of the action; and praying for the possession of the premises and for damages in the sum of $250. The defendants file their answer, and deny that the plaintiffs purchased this land of O. W. Seay in September of 1898, and deny the ownership of the plaintiffs thereto, and deny that they have been in the unlawful possession of the premises sued for or that they are now in the unlawful possession of the same. Further answering, they say that O. W. Seay, abandoned' all claim, right, or title that he had to these premises, and permitted said land to become a part of the public domain; that the defendant, as agent of certain codefendants, who were members of the Choctaw Tribe of Indians took possession of said lands, and placed a wire fence around the same, acting upon the representations made by said O. W. Seay that he, O. W. Seay, had abandoned all claim that he 'had in and to said property; that said defendant Reynolds, believing the statements of Seay, expended money in fencing said lands, to the end that his co-defendants Engleman and Dufords might allot said lands as their proportionate part of said Choctaw Nation, and that said O. W. Seay gave said lands to said Indian citizens, and placed them in the possession of the same, and agreed that the fence might be placed where it now is; that such improvements were reduced to the possession of 'the defendants long before any transfer was made by the said Seay in this action; and ask to be discharged, with their costs. The case was tried to a jury, evidence submitted on both sides in behalf of both' parties, and the jury returned a verdict finding for the plaintiffs, assessing damages in the sum of $87.15. Judgment was pronounced in favor of plaintiffs on said verdict. Defendants thereafter filed their motion for new trial, which was presented to the court and overruled, and appeal taken to this court.

Boundaries—Parol Agreement Establishing — Uncertainty as to Boundary.—The rule that where coterminous proprietors of land in good faith agree upon, fix, and establish a boundary line between their respective tracts of land, in which they acquiesce, and under which they occupy, for a period equal to that fixed by the statute of limitations, the line as thus established is binding upon them, is subject to the limitation that the agreement must be for the purpose of settling some uncertainty or dispute as to the real boundary. Id. — Parol Agreement for Exchange — Known Boundary Line.— Where coterminous landowners, knowing that a portion of the land of each was separated from the main body of the tract to which it belonged by a county road, orally agreed to exchange the parcels so separated, and built, fences and went into possession of the pieces as if the exchanges had been effected by proper conveyances, such agreement had no effect as an agreement for the location of a disputed boundary line, and did not operate to effect the exchange. Adverse Possession — Payment of Taxes Essential. — The actual occupation of land, initiated in the year 1884, cannot ripen into title by adverse possession, in the absence of a showing that the possessor of the land or his grantors had for the statutory period paid the taxes which had been levied upon the land, as required by section 325 of the Code of Oivil Procedure. Kjectment—Legal Title Shown in Plaintiff—Immaterial Parol Evidence.—In an action to recover the possession of a tract of land, to which the plaintiff established a clear title in himself by the production of a deed conveying the legal title, a defendant, relying solely upon the ineffectual defenses of adverse possession and a parol agreement as to boundaries, was not injured by the admission of parol evidence tending to show that the plaintiff had acquired the title before he received the deed conveying the legal title.

In an action to recover for loss from alleged negligence caused by a fire, tbe law does not require proof by direct evidence that tbe fire was caused in a particular way, but it is necessary to establish not only that it could possibly come from the cause assigned, but was the probable and natural cause, and this may be shown by circumstantial as well as direct evidence. 2. If there are other independent causes present from which the fire might have originated, plaintiff must show defendant’s acts or omissions produced the injury; the other possible causes must be eliminated. 3. Defendant cannot allege as a defense that an ordinary high wind was the intervention of an independent and unforeseen cause, inasmuch as the danger of ordinary wind helping a fire to spread is one of the things to be naturally anticipated. 4. Plaintiff cannot be charged with contributory negligence in not entering defendant’s property and getting the fire under control, where it appears he endeavored to put the fire out at the boundary fence, and he could not control the movement of burning material blown through the air. 5.

       "  'case_summary': 'PRATT et ux., Respondents, v. SALINE VALLEY RAILWAY COMPANY, Appellant. St. Louis Court of Appeals, March 17, 1908. 1. EMINENT DOMAIN: Taking Land for Railroad without Condemnation: Estoppel. In an action for .damages to the plaintiff’s farm caused by the construction of a railroad through it without any condemnation proceedings on the part of the railroad company, defendant, the evidence is examined and held that the acts of the plaintiff would not justify a declaration of law that the plaintiff was estopped to claim damages. 2. -: -: Remedy of Landowner. Where land is appropriated by a railroad company for right of way without condemnation proceedings, the landowner may recover in an action for damages the value of the land appropriated and the damage to the remainder of the land, and need not proceed under the provisions of section 1271, Revised Statutes 1899. 3. JURISDICTION: Supreme Court and Court of Appeals: Title to Land Involved: Damage to Land Appropriated by . Railroad Company. In an action brought by a landowner to recover damages to his land on account of the construction of a railroad through it, where on the question of damages it was pleaded in defense that the plaintiff had a life estate only and not a fee simple -estate in the premises, the title to real estate was not involved, so as to divest the Court of Appeals of jurisdiction to entertain an appeal of the cause. 4. ESTATES: Life Estate: “Heirs:\\'’ Wills. The use of the word “heirs” in connection with a devise is not necessary in order to pass by will a fee simple title, under section 4690, Revised Statutes 1899, but its use in that connection may be material in ascertaining whether the intention of the testator was to vest a life estate or a fee simple, when the purpose of the instrument is doubtful. 6. -: -: Restriction on Alienation: Wills. Where a will gave land to a devisee and her heirs and restricted them from selling or encumbering it for a term of fifty years after the testator’s death, such restriction was void as against public policy, but the restriction could be taken into consideration as throwing light on the intention of the testator. 6. -: -: -: -. Where a testator devised to his daughter and her heirs a tract of land and provided that neither she nor her heirs could sell or contract any debts on the land until fifty years after the testator’s death, that she should divide the land equally among her heirs and if she failed to do so there should be commissioners appointed to divide it, these provisions of the will gave to the daughter a life estate only. Appeal from Butler Circuit Court. — No». J. 0. Sheppard, Judge. Reversed and remanded. Giboney Houck and Benson 0. Hardesty for appellant. The plain and manifest intent of Lorenz is to devise a life estate to Ms daughter Anna and the remainder to her heirs (children). (1) Even the words “desire,” “request,” “recommend,” “hope,” etc., when they come from a testator who has the power to command, are often construed as commands, clothed merely in the language of civility. Chiles v. Bartleson, 21 Mo. 344; Munro v. Collins, 95 Mo. 33; Erickson v. Wil- Hard, 1 N. H. 217. (2) It is the popular meaning of the term among laymen, and the courts always construe the ivord heirs to mean “children,” whenever that is the sense in which a testator uses it. Maguire v. Moore, 108 Mo. 273. (3) Hating repeatedly used the word “heirs” in the sense of “children” and as a. word of purchase, the presumption is that he is still so using it when he says, “To my daughter, Anna M. Pratt, and her heirs.” And to construe the word heirs as a word of limitation in the above clause just quoted, and to hold that Anna acquired a fee under the devise in question, is a plain violation of the canon under consideration. Waddell v. Waddell, 99 Mo. 345; Woerner on Administration, sec. 416, par. 3. (4) Defendant’s evidence, tended to prove the necessary elements of an “es-toppel in pais,” and the court erred in refusing to allow this issue to go to the jury. Newman v. Hook, 37 M\\'o. 207; Rice v. Bunce, 49 Mo. 321; Spence v. Renfro, 179 Mo. 417; Bank v. Ragsdale, 171 Mo. 168; Bank v. Frame, 112 Mo. 502. (5) The remedy provided plaintiffs in section 1271, Revised Statutes Missouri 1899, is exclusive of all other remedies. The same act which provides for the damaging of private property for public use now prescribes the remedy. The remedy provided is adequate and complete and within the election of either party. It therefore completely supersedes and is exclusive of all,other remedies. Where either party may be the actor, neither can complain that the other did not begin. Evans v. Railroad, 64 Mo. 453; Lindell’s Adm. v. Railroad, 36 Mo. 543; Soulard v. St. Louis, 36 Mo. 546; Leary v. Railroad, 38 Mo. 486; Hickman v. Kansas City, 120 Mo. 110; Jamison v. Springfield, 53 M\\'o. 229; State ex. inf. v. Railroad, 176 Mo. 717. Jerry B. Burhs and G. J. Stanton for respondents. Now, we are not disposed to write a treatise on the law of wills, hut do insist that under the authorities below cited, and under a common sense interpretation of the will of John Lorenz, deceased, plaintiff, Anna M. Pratt, became, under said will, the owner in fee simple of the lands for which damage is asked. \"It conveyed a fee in first instance, and any subsequent attempt to cut this estate down necessarily must fail.

It is conceded that the original, petition consisting of 56 sheets, each having a printed head, identical in terms and describing the same district, contained 490 signatures, and that at least 920 votes were cast in the district at the last general election. On receiving the petition I announced through the press that I should hold the petition until August 8, 1904, before determining the question as to ordering an election. In the meantime all parties interested have, been given reasonable access to the petition, through copies furnished or actual inspection, and a full hearing has been given to persons desiring to be heard in support of or in opposition to the ordering of an election as asked. Although not partaking of the character of a formal hearing, the questions presented here have been so fully discussed and. are of such interest and importance to a proper understanding of the law in question and the involved rights -of the citizens that a fuller statement of my conclusions may be proper than would be justified in a matter of less importance.\",\n",

Joseph Spitzmiller et al. 1, Policy of Law with Reference to Prescriptive Title to Land Dedicated for Street Purposes. A private person, claiming title to land which originally belonged to the public for street purposes, should base his claim on estoppel rather than the statute of limitations, and recognition will hardly be given to a claim by prescription unless in regard to land upon which valuable improvements* have been erected. 2. Character of the Improvements Which will Create Estoppel Against the Public. When the grade of an unimproved street was such that it could not be used by vehicles until improved, the inclosure by an abutting owner of a part of the dedicated strip by a fence for a period of less than twenty-one years does not afford ground for enjoining its improvement on a claim of title by adverse possession.

       "  'case_summary': \"SMITH v. THE STATE 1. A public highway may be established — 1, by a laying out according to the statute; 2, by the uninterrupted use and enjoyment by the public of the road as a highway for not less than twenty years, without any circumstances to negative the intention to dedicate; and 3, by the actual dedication by the owner to the public as a highway. 2. If a deed call for a corner of two roads or the side of a road as a beginning corner or monument, and there be a known actual corner or side existing at the time of the deed, the actual existing corner, and not an ambiguous corner to be ascertained by surveying out the road, is the corner called for. 3. The public right to a road, once obtained by dedication or laying out, cannot afterwards be lost by non user or neglect of the overseers to work or open the road, as laid out or dedicated. The writ of error in this cause removed into this court the judgment of the Supreme Court, rendered at the term of July, 1851, against the plaintiff in error, which judgment was in affirmance of a judgment in the Passaic Oyer and Terminer against Joseph Smith, upon an indictment for nuisance in obstructing part of a public street in the town of Paterson, by erecting a building, projecting in said street fifty feet in length, and five feet in breadth. To the charge of the Court of Oyer and Terminer, the defendant, Smith, prayed a bill of exceptions, upon which the errors in the Supreme Court were assigned. By the evidence, it appeared that the street or highway in which the obstruction was alleged- to be made was laid out by surveyors of the highways on the 22d day of September, 1761; that the monuments called for in the return were destroyed, and could not now be found ; that the middle of the road was laid along the north line of a farm, afterwards called the Abraham Van Houten farm ; and that the road was known by the name of the old York road ; and that the house which caused the obstruction was situate on the south side of the old York road, where it was intersected by a street, known as Main street, opened near forty years after the old York road, and running north and south ; and that the west side of the building was on the line of Main street; that Abraham Van Houten, before 1800, lived on the Van Houten farm, and had his garden fence erected north of his house, along the south side of the old York road, along by the place where the defendant’s building was erected and across what was afterwards Main street, and that this fence was in a line with the post and rail fence that extended along said farm eastwardly; that, after the opening of Main street, Abraham laid out a row of building lots, east of and adjoining Main street and fronting on the old York road ; that these lots had been for forty years sold as lots one hundred feet deep and fronting on the old York road, and abutting in the rear on the north line of a lot known as the stable lot, which was an old and well known boundary line; that the corner lot, on which the defendant’s building stood, had been conveyed, since 1807, by all the different owners as fronting on the old York road, and one hundred feet deep to the stable lot; that, in 1812, a picket fence was standing on the front of the lot in a line with a house known as the Berry house, standing on the lot next adjoining on the east, and that the public used the street and footpath up to the picket fence and to the front of the Berry house, which line was one hundred feet north of the north line of the stable lot; that, in 1820, a building was on the corner lot upon the line of the picket fence, and that the building and the Berry house and other houses on said lots stood on the same line, and that up to that line it was used as a public street, except the obstruction occasioned by stoops, platforms, and cellar doors, until 1848, when these buildings were burnt down by fire. In 1849, the north part of the corner lot was sold to the defendant by a deed, in which the description bounded him on the old York road or Broadway, and described his first line as running about twenty feet eight inches from the corner of Main street and Broadway, the distance bringing the north line exactly where the building and picket fence had stood. The owners of the lot, since 1820 until 1849, had always considered the north side of their building as the south side of the street, and had south of it the distance called for by their deeds. In 1835, a survey had been made of the old York road under the direction of the town committee; and the surveyor, taking certain old buildings standing on the north side of the road, which were supposed or reputed to be on the line of the street, for his guide, made the south side of the street five feet further north than the side of the corner building. The evidence, as to reputed boundaries, was' uncertain and contradictory. The defendant, in July, 1849, erected his store, a three-story brick building, five feet farther north than the old line upon which the former buildings stood, and upon the line as run out in the survey of 1835. The question therefore arose, whether, if the true boundary of the highway could not be ascertained, or if the boundary of the highway laid out in 1761 was the line run in 1835, thewser by the public, in the manner testified, for near forty years wonld, dedicate the strip so used to public use. The charge of the court is given at length, with the exceptions of the defendant thereto, in the original report of the ease in the Supreme Court (ante, p. 130). The jury, under this charge, found the defendant guilty, upon which verdict the court gave judgment that the nuisance be abated, and that the defendant do pay a fine, &c. Vroom and W. Pennington, for plaintiff in error. The great error of the court below was the assumption, in the charge to the jury, that by the user of the public for thirty-five years, this land had been dedicated to the public as part of this road. We contend that the question of dedication is a question of intention, which ought to have been left to the jury. 6 Peters 438; 3 Kent 431; 19 Conn. 268, Noyes v. Ward; 8 Ad. & Ellis 99, Barricklo v. Johnson. What was the intention of the owners, is to be found by the jury, and inferred from circumstances ; and no length of time will dedicate a road, unless it bo the intention of party to dedicate. Here there was a highway laid out; parties only intended that their land included in the road laid out should be used bv and dedicated to the public, and if from uncertainty as to the line of the road, they permitted the public to use beyond it; still, as their intention was only to dedicate to that line whereon it was, there can be no inference of law of an intention to dedicate beyond it. 3 Mass. 406; 1 Zab. 145, Stuyvesant v. Woodruff. This made it important where the original survey of the road was, and the charge of the court on that poiut was against law. Zabriskie and Dayton, for defendant in error. This is a question as to what amounts to a dedication of land to the public for a highway. The error assigned is, that the court charged the jury that a user by the public of a strip 'of land as a highway for over twenty-five years, with the knowledge and assent of the owner, dedicafes that land to the public, without reference to the question whether the owner intended to dedicate it to the public. There are two modes of dedicating land to the public — one is by some act or action which shows an intention to dedicate it, and this requires no more time than is necessary to perform the act which constitutes the dedication, as by a deed declaring that it is so dedicated, by making a map with streets, and selling lots upon them ; by opening a street, grading it, and inviting the public to use it. 6 Wend. 651, Denning v. Rome; 8 Wend. 105, Livingston v. Mayor of New York; 19 Wend. 138, Matter of Thirty-second street; Spencer 86, Dummer ads. Dew; 1 Hill 189, Matter of Twenty-ninth street; 1 Hill 191, Matter of Thirty-ninth street. ■ Another mode by which a street may be dedicated is user of it as a public street by the public for twenty years without any intention of the owner to dedicate it, or evidence of such intention other than such user. If the use is permissive, and so understood by the public, then it is not used as a public street, and of consequence the user would not dedicate. And the question here is, not what is the intention of the owner, but what is the understanding of the public under which they use it. If they use it as a right, it is under an adverse claim, and such adverse user will establish the right, and dedicate the way, by analogy to the statute of limitations. This distinction will reconcile the authorities and cases, which sometimes seem contradictory from losing sight of it. An intention to dedicate, once manifested by clear evidence, dedicates in a day. A few years user as a street with assent of owner to user, without any other express act of dedication, will dedicate, and twenty years user by public as a highway, without any intent to dedicate, or any other assent to such user, will dedicate the part so used. 22 Pick. 75, Valentine v. Boston; 3 Kent. 452; 19 Pick. 147, Stetson v. Faxon; 19 Conn. 265, Noyes v. Ward; 19 Pick. 406, Hobbs v. Lowell; 5 Barn. & Ad. 469, Rex v. Leake. The court did not, in the language of the bill of exceptions, tell the jury that it was an established fact that the road was dedicated, but that “ if you believe the witnesses,” who show that this land was used by the public with the assent of the owners for more than twenty-five years, this evidence establishes the public right. And so, as to the third exception, the court say, “ if this be so,” that is, if this strip be dedicated by user, it is not material where the road was originally laid out. * Ante, p. 130. * The judgment is according to tlie old and well settled authorities. 2 Str. 686, Rex v. Papineau; 7 Term R. 463, R. v. Yorkshire; 8 Term R. 142, R. v. Stead; 13 East 163, R. v. Incledon; 1 Hawk. P. C. 695 ; Bk. 1, ch. 75; 1 Russel on Cr. 381; Roscoe Cr.

Where an addition to a city was platted with reference to monuments fixed by a government survey, there being no actual survey of the ground, and streets of such addition marked on the plat, were subsequently located on the ground by measurements with a chain without other instruments, the lines of the streets so measured, and corners so located, must yield to the true location made by an accurate survey controlled by the government monuments as indicated in the recorded plat. 2. -: -: addition to city: streets and alleys: reservations.

Thomas é Haekney for appellant. (1) Plaintiff’s fence was shown to be on the line of the original stakes set when the addition was surveyed and platted. The true line is determined by the location of these stakes and not by the calls of the plat. Jones v. Poundstone, 102 Mo. 244; Whitehead v. Ragan, 106 Mo. 235; Smith v. Co., 117 Mo. 438; Harding v. Wright, 119 Mo. 1. Even though the surveyor, in making the original survey of the addition, adopted an improper base line, or ran the lines on an improper variation, the lines thus established and marked off on the surface of the land became fixed boundaries, which can not be changed or shifted by new -surveying. Authorities supra. These stakes control the location of the lines in the addition. Flynn v. Glenny, 51 Mich. 580; Tarpenning v. Cannon, 28 Kan. 665. The old fences erected in accordance with these stakes are better evidence of the true boundary lines than the new survey, which was not run with reference to any monuments on the land or the original survey, but is based solely on the surveyor’s interpretation of the calls in the plat, and which is shown to be at variance with all the old additions in the city. Delhi v. Zanger, 39 Mich. 605; Beaubein v. Kellogg, 69 Mich. 333; Carpenter v. Monks, 81 Mich. 103. (2) The offer of Parsons & Case to the public was not binding on them until accepted; and, until acceptance, they had the right to resume dominion over the property, either in whole or in part, as against the public, and thus revoke in whole or in part the dedication.

The street lines were, therefore, limited to such parts as were actually cut out and left open to the public. In accepting the streets now, the city and public must take them in the condition they are in at the time of acceptance, and not as they were when the offer to dedicate was first made. (3) The city can not now question the lines of Case street as fenced. The property owners and the public have recognized these lines as correct ever since 1868. Improvements made by property owners, corners established by surveyors, and the use by the public, have all been in conformity thereto. The lines thus recognized and acquiesced in for such length of time are binding on the city as well as private owners. Gregory v. Knight, 50 Mich. 61; Dupont v. Starring, 42 Mich. 492; Twogood v.

Adverse Possession — Policy of the Law With Reference to Prescriptive Title to Land Dedicated for Street Purposes — Character of the Improvements Which Will Create Estoppel Against the Public. 1. The decisions of the Ohio Supreme Court show a tendency to require a private person, claiming through adverse possession title to land which originally belonged to the public for street purposes, to base his claim on estoppel rather than the statute of limitations, and recognition will hardly be given to a claim by prescription unless in regard to land upon which valuable improvements have been erected. 2. Where the grade of an unimproved street was such that it could not be used by vehicles until improved, the inclosure by an abutting owner of a part of the dedicated strip by a fence for a period of less than twenty-one years does not afford ground for enjoining its improvement on a claim of title by adverse possession.

       "  'case_summary': 'UNITED STATES v. RINDGE et al. (District Court, S. D. California, S. D. October 27, 1913.) 1. Highways (§ 5 ) — Private Roads — Rights of Public. Wliere certain roads were built across a ranch after 1883 by settlers to reach their claims on public land and were used by occasional hunters and pleasure seekers, and the ranch owner never consented to their use by the public, the fact that they were used at some times by persons not settlers, without objection from the owner, was insufficient to make them public highways. [Ed. Note. — For other cases, see Highways, Cent. Dig. §§ 6, 7; Dec. Dig. § 5. ] 2. Highways (§ 2 ) — Public Highways — User. Pol. Code Cal. § 2618, declares that public highways are roads, streets, alleys, etc., laid out or erected as such by the public or, if laid out or erected by others, dedicated or abandoned to the public or made such in actions for the partition of real property, and section 2621 declares that no road or traveled way, used by one or more persons over another’s land, shall become a public highway by use or until so declared by the board of supervisors or by dedication by the owner of the land affected. Held, that, under such provisions, a road over another’s land cannot become a public highway by user. [Ed. Note. — For other cases, see Highways, Cent. Dig. § 3; Dec. Dig. § 2.“ | 3. Highways (§ 1 ) — Establishment—Abandonment—Dedication. Unless a highway is established by public authority, there must be an abandonment or dedication thereof to the public by the landowner, and, though.this, need not be by express grant nor evidenced by writing, there must be evidence showing an intention to abandon or dedicate the land to the use of the public or proved facts from which such intention may be fairly deduced. [Ed. Note. — For other cases, see Highways, Cent. Dig. §§ 1, 2; Dec. Dig. § 1 1 4. Dedication (§ 20*) — Abandonment to Public Use — Evidence. Occasional and irregular travel across a ranch by land claimants and hunters was not evidence of an abandonment or dedication of the land covered by the trails to public use for highway purposes by the owner, nor was \"it evidence of adverse use necessary to establish a presumption of dedication. [Ed. Note. — For other cases, see Dedication, Cent. Dig. §§ 17-30; Dec. Dig. § 20. ] 5. Highways (§. 155 ) — Public Highways — Interest oe United States. Where certain crossroads through a ranch privately owned were not highways, and there was no access by such ways from the public domain to a beach road, the United States had no interest in the question whether the beach road was a public highway. [Ed. Note. — For other cases, see Highways, Cent. Dig. §§ 432-430; Dec. Dig. § 155. ] 6. Highways (§ 99 ) — Establishment—Maintenance—Jurisdiction—State or Federal Authority. The establishment and maintenance of highways as such over privately owned lands is a matter primarily for the control of state authorities, in which the federal government is not interested. [Ed. Note. — For other eases, see Highways, Cent. Dig. §§ 323-330; Dec. Dig. § 99. ] 7. Highways (§ 155 ) — Obstruction—Injunction—Right to Sue. A private owner of land has no right to enjoin the obstruction of a road unless he can show access thereto over some lawful way, and the\\' federal government has no other or greater rights. [Ed. Note. — For other cases, see Highways, Cent. Dig. §§ 432-436; Dec. Dig. § 155. ] 8. Highways (§ 1 ) — Way op Necessity. Ways of necessity are essentially private ways and not public highways. [Ed. Note. — For other cases, see Highways, Cent Dig. §§ 1, 2; Dec. Dig. § 1. ] 9. Public Lands (§ 114 ) — -Patent—Way op Necessity — Implied Reservation. In the absence of a reservation in a grant of public land, there is no implied reservation of a right of way over the land granted to afford access by the public to other land belonging to the government. [Ed. Note. — For other cases, see Public Lands, Cent. Dig. §§ 314-322; Dec. Dig. § 114. ] 10. Easements (§ 18 ) — Way op Necessity. Ordinarily a way of necessity arises when the owner of a tract of land conveys a portion thereof to another and there is no access from a public highway to the land conveyed except over the grantor’s remaining land or that of a stranger, or when the owner sells a portion of his land and the part remaining is inaccessible except over the land sold or that of a stranger, and such right does not arise where the claimed way is merely more convenient or desirable than some other way because of the mountainous character of the country, etc. [Ed. Note. — For other cases, see Easements, Cent. Dig. §§ 50-55; Dec. Dig. § 18. ] 11. Easements (§ 18 ) — Way of Necessity — Time of Necessity. In order to establish a right to a way of necessity, the necessity must exist at the time of the grant and as to the whole tract conveyed or reserved, since neither a grantee nor grantor can subsequently subdivide his land and sell off a roi’tion in such a manner as to create a way of necessity in favor of his grantees over parts previously granted unless the way rests in grant or the easement is an apparent and continuous one, existing and in use at the time of the conveyance. [Ed. Note. — For other cases, see Easements, Cent. Dig. §§ 50-55; Dec. Dig. § 18. ] 12. Public Lands (§ 19 ) — Fence Law — Effect. Act Cong. Feb. 25, 1885, c. 149, § 1, 23 Stat. 321 (U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 1524), prohibits the inclosure of public land, and section 3 forbids obstruction to or prevention of entry on or free passage over or through public lands by force, threats, intimidation, or unlawful fences or inclosures. Meld,, that such act was simply intended to preserve access to the public domain and was not intended to interfere with the use and enjoyment of private property unless such use was a mere subterfuge for inclosing or preventing access to the public domain; and hence the act did not prevent a property owner from constructing fences in good faith on her own land to protect the same against trespass, and useful for the proper enjoyment of such land, without any intention of appropriating or inclosing public lands or preventing lawful access thereto.

       "  'case_summary': 'F. J. Schwab v. Sarah Bickel or Helen Barron, Appellant. Province of court and jury — Adverse possession. What constitutes adverse possession is for the court; but the facts supporting the claim must be established to the satisfaction of the jury. The reason for this rule is that title being shown the law presumes the true owner to be in possession until adverse possession is proved to begin. Adverse possession — Essentials to support. To support adverse possession and set the statute of limitations running, there must be an actual entry and usage of the property such as the true owner thereof might make, without leave or permission, with the intention to retain possession and profits thereof as his own; this intention must be manifest and may be inferred from the manner of occupancy. In other words the essentials to constitute adverse possession are, (1) actual possession, which shall be (2) hostile and adverse, (3) continuous, (4) visible, open, notorious and exclusive, and (5) held under color or claim of title. Trespass by tenants — Results as to landlord — Adverse possession. A trespass by tenants demonstrating all the essentials of an adverse possession relates to the landlord with all responsibilities and advantages therefrom when knowledge of and acquiescence in the trespass are brought home to the landlord. Referee\\'s failure to find facts, when not conclusive. The rule that a referee’s findings of fact are as conclusive as a verdict of a jury does not preclude inquiry into the evidence, when it is apparent that the referee failed to find pertinent facts, not because he did not believe the witnesses but because he deemed the facts testified by them immaterial. Argued Jan. 9, 1899. Appeal, No. 2, Jan. T., 1899, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. Luzerne Co., Oct. T., 1894, No. 1047, dismissing exceptions to referee’s report, finding for \"the plaintiff, in an action of ejectment. Before Rice, P. J., Beaver, Orlady, Smith, W. W. Porter, W. D. Porter and Beeber^ JJ. Reversed. Opinion by Beaver, J. Ejectment. Before Schuyler, P. J., of the Bd judicial district, specially presiding. It appears from the referee’s report that this action arose about the right to the possession of a narrow strip of land something over two feet wide and fifty-nine feet in length, defendant claiming title to it by adverse possession under the statute of limitations. The facts sufficiently appear in the opinion of the court. The referee found that the title to the land in dispute, which the plaintiff established in himself, had not been divested by an adverse possession of the defendant and persons under whom she claims, and that the judgment be entered for the plaintiff for the land contained in the amended description. Defendant appealed. Errors assigned among others were (3) to that portion of the eleventh finding of fact, which is as follows : “ There is no evidence that Rutledge ever authorized his lessee to claim or to inclose the land, and there is no evidence that Schwab ever had any actual notice of any hostile claim by Rutledge, though he knew of the erection of the building within two or three years after it was built.” (5) In his answer to defendant’s third request of finding of law, which is as follows : “ The third is a mixed conclusion of law and fact. The law is correctly stated, but it is not applicable to the facts of this case.\\' Rutledge never took possession by or through his tenant. On the contrary, he declined to make or pay for the improvements, and there was no evidence that he took additional rent for them after they were made.” (6) In his answer to defendant’s fourth request for finding of law, the request being as follows: “ The improvements placed upon the ground in dispute by Bonnie Reed in 1869, with the knowledge and consent of her landlord, Rutledge, would render him liable in damages for the same, for the reason that he ratified it by accepting rent from her. Hence, the use of the land for the statutory period, twenty-one years, in an open, notorious, continuous and hostile manner would inure to his benefit and give him a title to same by adverse possession. Answer: The fourth conclusion is denied as incorrect as to both law and fact.” (7) In his answer to defendant’s sixth and seventh requests for findings of law, which is as follows : “The sixth conclusion is based upon the idea that there was a boundary fence between the Rutledge lot and the Schwab lot, which I have found to be incorrect. The seventh conclusion is denied. I do not think the trespass of Rutledge’s tenants could, under any circumstances, give him a claim to title to his neighbor’s land.” (9) To that portion of the judge’s opinion on the referee’s report and exceptions, which is as follows: “ All these exceptions, however, may be reduced to one, viz.: that the referee erred in his finding, that the trespasses of Rutledge’s tenants on the land of Schwab, even if done with his knowledge and consent, could not give him or his vendee title under the statute of limitations, no matter how long continued. That this is a sound legal proposition we have no doubt.” John McGrahren and Edward A. Lynch, for appellant. This is an action of ejectment brought for a strip of land two and three tenths feet \\'wide and fifty-nine feet deep. The appellee claims a right to the possession of this, land by virtue of a deed or recorded title. The appellant claims it by virtue of an adverse possession. The fact of possession is for the. jury ; the kind and length of that possession to be effectual are for the court. Where such title is asserted, either by the plaintiff or the defendant, the court should see that there is evidence to go to the jury on all the essential points. If it be wanting as to any of them, then, an essential of title is wanting, and the duty of the judge is plain: Rice, P. J., in Deppen v. Bogar, 7 Pa. Superior Ct. 434, 449. If one agrees to a trespass which has been committed by another for his benefit tins action lies against him, although it was not done in obedience to his commands, or at his request: Bac. Abr. title “ Trespass,” 448. Rutledge so far participated in the acts of his tenant, Reed, as to make him equally liable with her. In trespass the intention of the wrongdoer is immaterial, and, therefore, ignorance that the act in question was a trespass on the lands of another, cannot be set up to prevent recovery: 1 Chitty, Pl. 129; Dundas v. Muhlenberg, 35 Pa. 351. The law is well laid down that any person who is present at the commission of a trespass, encouraging or exciting the same by words, gestures, looks or signs, or who in any way or by any means countenances or approves tbe same, is in law deemed to be an aider and abettor, and is liable as principal; and proof that a person is present at the commission of a trespass without disapproving or opposing it, is evidence from which, in connection with other circumstances, it is competent for the jury to infer that he assented thereto, lent to it his countenance and approval, and was thereby aiding and abetting the same: 3 Greenleaf’s Evidence, sec. 41; Brown v. Perkins, 83 Mass. 89; Carson v. Godley, 26 Pa. 111; Reynolds v. Braithwaite, 131 Pa. 422. If he was .present and cognizant of the trespass he would be jointly liable: Drake v. Kiely, 93 Pa. 497. He who ratifies a trespass may be jointly liable: 26 Am. & Eng. Ency. of Law, 576. The possession of the tenant or agent is the possession of the landlord: 26 Am. & Eng. Ency. of Law, 586; Thompson v. Kauffelt, 110 Pa. 209. A leading case in point and in line with the decisions of our own state is Hitchings v. Morrison, 72 Maine, 331. S. J. Strauss, for appellee. In such a case the payment of taxes on the land in dispute is not conclusive of the title, yet when it occurs with other relevant facts, it is admissible in evidence and is entitled to consideration to show “ the extent of his claim and possession:” McClure v. Jones, 121 Pa. 550; Irwin v. Patchen, 164 Pa. 51. The deed from Rutledge to defendant is also a solemn declaration on the part of Rutledge of the extent of his claim, following as it does the dimensions as contained in the deed to him from Wood, and is practically an assertion that he sold the defendant what he bought from Wood, neither more nor less. The intention to claim possession adversely must have been manifested by Rutledge. To make a possession adverse there must be some decisive and unequivocal act or conduct amounting to an adverse and wrongful possession in himself and\\' disseisin of others : Hart v. Gregg, 10 Watts, 185. There must be an entry by the so-called disseisor. If, through inadvertence or mistake, part of an adjoining piece of land is inclosed, making no claim to the piece, but only to the true line, the possession is not adverse: Commegys v. Carley, 3 Watts, 280; Sailor v. Herzogg, 2 Pa. 185. July 28, 1899: And why must it be so ? Because the statute protects the occupant, not for his merit, for he has none, but for the merit of his antagonist in delaying the contest beyond the period assigned for it, when papers may be lost, facts forgotten, or witnesses dead: Calhoun v. Cook, 9 Pa. 226. Adverse possession in case of boundaries does not hold with the same force as in possession of an entire tract: Gray v. McCreary, 4 Yeates, 494. And this latter case has been cited with approval in Calhoun v. Cook, supra, and Hoopes v. Garver, 16 Pa. 517, 526. There is in this case, moreover, proof of a friendly and permissive use of other lands of the plaintiff by Rutledge’s tenants concerning the character of which there can be no question.',\n",

RHINE, STEWART HENDERSON and E. A. ROBERTSON, Respondents. Kansas City Court of Appeals, June 2, 1913. 1. PUBLIC ROAD: Dedication. Where landowners, desiring to-give a road for public use, set their fences bach leaving a strip open for road purposes and thereafter maintain their fences along their respective sides, on the lines adopted by them, for a time in excess of the limitation period, such act is a dedication in pais or by implication of the land so opened, ■and needs neither written nor oral words to create it. .■2. -: -. Where landowners dedicate by implication land for a public road by setting their fences bach a reasonable distance and continuously maintain them at that line thereafter, such act, in the absence of anything to show an intention to dedicate a lesser or narrower strip, is a dedication of the land clear up to the line of fence maintained, and their successor's in title cannot afterwards claim a portion of said roadway merely because the public has not seen fit to use or improve the entire width of the right of way. 3. -: -: Extent of Ownership by Public. Where landowners have thus by their acts dedicated land for use as a public road, and the same is accepted and travelled by the public, the ownership of the public extends from one fence to the other and the public is not required to actually travel over and improve every inch of it in order to be entitled to the full width of the right of way. •4. TRIAL: Right to Jury. The right of a litigant to have a jury pass upon the questions of fact involved in his case is an important one and must not be infringed or encroached upon in the slightest degree. If a single point in the case rests upon a disputed question of fact, then it is error to •direct' the jury to return a particular verdict. If, however, .all the facts are conceded necessary to enable the court to ■apply the law, leaving nothing but the law to be determined, ■.then no issue is left for the jury, and a directed verdict is ;proper.

A' possessory right to enable the settler -to segregate and hold a portion of the public land can only be acquired by actual, as distinguished from constructive, possession, by which is meant a subjection of the land to the will and dominion of the claimant ; and this is usually evidenced by a substantial inclosure, by cultivation, occupation, or some other proper and appropriate use, according to the locality of the property.

The particular description of this survey by metes and bounds is set forth in the complaint, and plaintiffs allege that these lands, which embrace the principal business section of Haines Mission, or Haines, are now, and since 1897 have been, in the actual possession and occupation of the plaintiffs. Their respective claims to the various lots are specifically enumerated in the complaint, and it is there asserted by them that they have in good faith occupied the various parcels during the said time, and have constructed thereon buildings, such as stores, hotels, residences, etc., the value of which exceeds the sum of $50,000. They also assert a common interest and claim in and to certain streets, avenues, and alleys as public rights of way or highways, which they allege are used in common by all the residents of the town and by the public generally. They also allege that the defendant, Solomon Ripinsky, claims in and to the entire tract described in the complaint an interest or estate adverse to the plaintiffs, but that, with the exception of two small parcels, one 25 by 50 feet, which defendant purchased from one H. Pay, and the second 100 by 150 feet, occupied by him for residential purposes, the defendant has never occupied any of the land to which the plaintiffs seek to quiet their title, and that he has no title or interest in or to the said land. To the allegations of the plaintiffs the defendant interposes a general denial, and sets up an affirmative defense, in which he alleges that for a long time prior to August 1, 1897, his grantors were the owners and in possession of all the lands described, and that by virtue of the prior occupancy and'improvement of said land by his grantors they were entitled to the possession thereof, and that prior to August 1, 1897, the grantors had conveyed to the defendant all their rights, title, and interest therein; that under said conveyance defendant had gone into and remained in the actual, open, notorious, and exclusive possession and occupancy of said land as a home, by reason of which acts he was the owner thereof against all persons except the United States, and was entitled thereto, and to enter the same as a homestead under the act of Congress extending the homestead laws of the United States to Alaska. He also alleges that on the date above mentioned, and while he was such owner so in possession and occupancy, the plaintiffs and their grantors unlawfully and with force and violence, and against his will and in disregard of his rights, entered upon said lands and ousted him therefrom. The allegations of the affirmative defense are put in issue-by the reply. On stipulation of counsel, the testimony in the case was taken before a referee.. At the hearing before the referee, and before any evidence was taken, the defendant objected to the taking of any testimony on behalf of the plaintiffs, on the ground that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, or to entitle the plaintiffs to the relief sought, or to any relief. The question of the sufficiency of the complaint and of the amended complaint was raised by timely demurrer. The court, after hearing the demurrer to the original complaint, ordered the plaintiffs to specify the particular holdings, and, on this being done, defendant de murred'to the amended complaint. This demurrer was overruled. The question as to the sufficiency of the complaint, therefore,' was settled for the purposes of this trial. In order to determine the other questions raised' by counsel for the defendant in his brief, it will be necessary to first examine the evidence. Shackleford & Lyons, for plaintiffs. R. W.

But if he believed the line to be the true boundary, and claimed it as such but subject to correction if subsequent developments should show it to be erroneous, then he can acquire no title beyond the true line by his possession no matter how long he thus held it. And if both adjacent landowners occupied up to a line believing it to be the true line, but neither maintaining it against what might thereafter be discovered to be the true line, the possession of neither is adverse to the other.

(4) Where coterminous landowners mutually establish a boundary line and build to it, and use and occupy accordingly to it, for a period long enough to show their agreement and acquiescence, they and those claiming under them will be estopped from afterwards claiming a different boundary, although such acquiescence is for a shorter period than would constitute a bar under the statute of limitations.

(3) The possession, in order to sustain a verbal agreement between adjoining landowners, must be continuous whether for a sufficient time to cause the statutes of limitations to run or not. Hence in disregard thereof, the abandonment of the line, the changing of the fences, will avoid the rights of the parties to claim to the agreed time.',\n",

The husband and wife may abandon a part of the residence homestead as they might the whole, and by similar acts; and the setting it apart as a business house may constitute such abandonment of it for residence purposes. (Pp. 152, 153.) 2. Same. Having a business homestead on block 4 and a residence homestead on block 14, the husband and wife mortgaged the south half of the latter,—fenced \"off from the residence and having on it a cellar for a projected business house,—for money to erect such business house, into which the husband, on its completion, transferred his business from block 4. Held, that this was an abandonment of such south half as a residence homestead, and the mortgage was valid. (Pp. 151-154.) 3. Homestead—Mortgage Concurrent with Designation. A mortgage for money to erect a building to be used as a homestead is not void, because its execution, constituting one of the acts by which the property was set apart for the new use, was concurrent with the designation of \"the homestead. (Pp. 153, 154.) 4. Homestead—Designation by Preparation to Use Other Actual Homestead. While occupying a piece of property as his homestead, a man can not, by intention to use another in the future, establish a homestead right in such other place. (P. 154.) ON REHEARING. 5.

On reversing the judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals and approving that of the trial court, the latter judgment was here corrected in accordance with agreement of parties, and rendered accordingly. (Pp. 154, 155.) Error to the Court of Civil Appeals for the Fourth District, in an appeal from Bexar County. Mrs. Woeltz sued for divorce and division of property, making O’Brien, a mortgagee thereof, a defendant. She prosecuted error from a judgment holding his mortgage valid and foreclosing it, and had judgment reversed and rendered. O’Brien obtained writ of error from the Supreme Court. Geo. C. Altgelt, for plaintiff in error. The plaintiff, Ida Woeltz, as the wife of defendant August Woeltz, has no sufficient interest in the business homestead of defendant August Woeltz to maintain a suit for the cancellation of a deed of trust upon such business homestead, when the evidence shows that she has another and adequate family homestead entirely separate and apart from such business homestead. The Court of Civil Appeals erred in canceling the deed of trust upon lot No. 7 in block No. 30, because at the time of said deed of trust said lot was no part of the family homestead, and could not have been a part of the business homestead, because the evidence shows that plaintiff and defendant had another business homestead in block No. 4. Sanger v. Hicks Co., 56 S. W. Rep., 775. The Court of Civil Appeals erred in canceling the deed of trust upon the south half of lot No. 14, block No. 30, because the evidence shows that said half of lot No. 14, at the time of the execution of the deed of trust in favor of this applicant, was neither the business homestead nor the family homestead of August Woeltz and his wife, nor any part of either, but was being used as a camp yard for campers only, and has been segregated from the family homestead of August Woeltz with the consent of defendant in error, Ida Woeltz. Wynne v. Hudson, 66 Texas, 1. The Court of Civil Appeals erred in canceling the deed of trust upon lot No. 2 in block No. 4, because the evidence established that three - years after its abandonment as a business homestead and after the establishment of a business homestead upon part of lot No. 14, August Woeltz and wife renewed and confirmed the deed of trust. The District Court erred in overruling the first special exception of defendant to plaintiff’s» original petition, because this defendant was therein improperly joined as a defendant with his codefendant August Woeltz. The District Court erred in overruling the second special exception of defendant to plaintiff’s original petition, because the same is multifarious and contains a misjoinder of parties defendant, and a misjoinder of causes of action, to wit, a suit of divorce-against defendant Woeltz and for the partition of community property, and a suit against defendant O’Brien for the cancellation of a deed of trust in his favor and against his trustee, J.

Lots 13 and 14 in block 30 being used as a part of the residence homestead, the residence being upon the north half of lot 14, and all of said lots used as a part of the homestead, it was not competent for the husband and wife to cut lot 14 in two, and restrict the homestead to the north half thereof, and incumber the south half by a deed of trust for borrowing money.

The south half of lot 14 was not subject to be incumbered by this deed of trust, because, if not exempt as a part of the residence homestead, it was exempt as a business homestead. The deed of trust did not create a lien on the south half of lot 14 by reason of the fact that the money was expended in the erection of the brick house thereon, as the same was not a mechanic’s lien either statutory or contractual.

Sighway— boundaries of— duty of adjoining owner to establish— liability for excavations near. If a house or store is built a few feet from the margin of a street or highway, and no fence is erected along or near the margin, persons traveling along the highway are at liberty to assume that the building is on the margin of the street, and that they may lawfully travel over the whole space thus apparently set apart for public use, and the owner of the adjoining land is liable to a traveler who, without fault on his part, falls into an excavation negligently made by such owner in the vicinity of the highway. . Cleveland v. Cleveland (12 Wend., 172) followed; Binks v. South Yorkshire B. B. Co. (113 E. O. L., 244) and Sowland v. Vincent (10 Met., 371) disapproved. Hpw far from the margin of the highway the adjoining owner may make an excavation, without being liable to persons who may fall into it, is to be determined by the jury in each case, having regard to the knowledge of the traveler, the width of the highway, its surroundings and the mode of its use. Appeal from an order made at the Special Term, granting a motion for a new trial, made upon a case and exceptions. In November, 1872, the plaintiff was passing along Exchange street, or alley, in the village of Bath, in the county of Steuben, from his shop to his boarding-house, and, on his way, he passed over the rear of a lot owned ■ by defendant, on which he had been erecting a building, having openings in front of the cellar windows to admit light; they were left uncovered, and he fell in and injured himself; and he brings this action against the defendant to recover the damages sustained by his fall; charging it to have resulted from the negligence of the defendant. Franklin street, or alley, was laid out by the owners of land over which it passes, over twenty years before the injury sustained by the defendant; and, although never recorded as a public street or highway, it has been used during all that time by persons with teams, and by persons on foot, at pleasure. This street or alley extends from Steuben street on the south to Buell street on the north. At its junction with Steuben street it is fifteen feet wide; at a point a few feet north, it widens six and one-half feet; and at a point a little further north, it widens seven, and one-half feet; but opposite the defendant’s building it is thirty feet wide. The west wall of defendant’s building is from five to seven feet from the east margin of Exchange street, or alley. At the time of the injury, there was a pile of stones on the west side of Exchange, in front of defendant’s building, and the middle of the stréet was muddy, so that foot passengers traveled near to defendant’s building. It was about eight p. m., that plaintiff started to go from his shop to the hotel where he boarded. It was quite dark, and looking like rain; as he came to defendant’s building, an omnibus, owned by one of the hotels, turned from Buell street into Exchange street, to go to the shed where it was kept when not in use. It went very near defendant’s building, so that plaintiff was compelled, in order to. avoid being struck by it, to approach near defendant’s building, and, in doing so, fell into the uncovered opening left to admit light to the basement, as above stated. These openings had been covered by planks; these planks had been removed and boards put in their places; and, on the evening in question, the boards also had been removed. There was nothing to indicate to travelers the trae boundary of the street. The wall of defendant’s building, on the east side of the street, and the remains of a cellar wall on the opposite side, were all the guides or landmarks travelers had to ascertain the boundaries of the street. The court charged that the question, whether the precise locus of the injury was within the bounds of the thoroughfare, or within the boundary of defendant’s lot, wasjuot important, except so far as it bore on the question of defendant’s negligence in leaving the area open. He further charged them that a person passing through an alley of that width cannot be required, and he is not to be expected, to know where the lines are. If he exercises ordinary prudence to keep within the lines, as marked by ostensible boundaries, that is all that can be required of him. It cannot be required of a man, before he passes through a thoroughfare, to call a surveyor and find out where its legal boundaries are. He may take the ostensible boundaries, and the reasonable indications where the boundaries are. If there had been a sidewalk along there, of brick, stone or plank, or any other substitute, the east edge of that sidewalk would have been the boundary of that alley. But there was nothing of that kind. He further charged them that plaintiff was not bound to know precisely where the legal east line of the alley was; and it would, according to the proof, have been quite impossible for him to obtain such knowledge, if he made use of diligence to do so. He further charged that the rule of law is, that a person is liable for an accident caused by an excavation upon his own- land, so situate that a person lawfully using the highway, and using ordinary caution, falls into the excavation; that is, if the excavation is situated so near the highway that a person lawfully using it, and using ordinary caution, falls into it, that excavation, thus made, is a public nuisance. If the excavation in question was on the highway, or so near that a person exercising ordinary and reasonable care for his own safety was liable to fall into it, the defendant is liable for having it there, unless it was protected in such manner as to save the passers by from falling into it. It makes no sort of difference whether the excavation was seven, nine or ten feet from the originally established bounds of the thoroughfare; if it was so situated that a person lawfully using the thoroughfare, and in a reasonable manner, was liable to fall into it, the defendant was liable. The defendant’s counsel excepted to the parts of the charge above quoted. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff of $351. The defendant’s counsel moved, on a case and exceptions, at Special Term, for a new trial. The motion was granted, and from the order granting it the plaintiff appealed to this court. W. B.

       "  'case_summary': '[L. A. No. 1550. Department Two. January 28, 1905.] In the Matter of the Estate of CATHERINE GEARY, Deceased. DANIEL GEARY, Respondent, v. MARY ELLEN BOARDMAN, Appellant. Appeal—Probate Litigation—Practice—New Trial—Bill op Exceptions.—The disposition of many attorneys to inject the procedure of a motion for a new trial into probate litigation uselessly raises difficult questions. The merits of an appeal from a probate order can ordinarily be fully reached on a bill of exceptions to the order itself which is sought to be reviewed. Id.—Probate Homestead—Declaration upon Community Property— Conveyances—Estate op Deceased Wipe.—Where a homestead was declared upon community property, and the husband alone thereafter conveyed it to a third person, who subsequently conveyed it to the wife, the surviving husband upon the administration of the estate of the deceased wife is .entitled to have the homestead set apart to him absolutely. The conveyance by the husband alone passed no title where it does not appear to be in trust for the wife, and the deed of his grantee to the wife conveyed nothing, even if the husband consented to or directed it. Id.—Suppiency op Description in Declaration—Identity—Erroneous Description Disregarded.—Where the declaration of homestead described the land by name as a lot of one hundred and sixty acres on which the husband had resided with his family for three years, which was then unsurveyed public land of the United States, an attempted description by legal subdivisions which, after the government survey, was found to be incorrect, may be disregarded as surplusage, there being a sufficient description to identify the premises. APPEAL from an order of the Superior Court of San Diego County setting apart a probate homestead and denying a new trial. N. H. Conklin, Judge. The facts are stated in the opinion of the court. Luce & Sloane, for Appellant. Lands described under a general name must designate a tract with well-defined boundaries. (Truett v. Adams, 60 Cal. 218; Burnett v. Kullak, 76 Cal. 535; Haley v. Amestoy, 44 Cal. 132.) The construction of the description is for the court, and parol evidence is not admissible to control its legal effect. (Fratt v. Woodward, 32 Cal. 219; Parker v. Kane, 22 How. 1; Winter v. White, 70 Md. 305; Benedict v. Gaylord, 11 Conn. 332. ) A conveyance by the husband to the wife of homestead property vests title in the wife. (Burkett v. Burkett, 78 Cal. 310; Pryal v. Pryal, 71 Pac. 822; Thompson on Homestead, see. 473.) The same rule applies to transfer of the homestead to the wife through a third person. (Stevens v. Castel, 63 Mich. 111; Reihl v. Bingenheimer, 28 Wis. 84.) J. B. Mannix, for Respondent. The proceeding upon motion for new trial is not applicable, and the statement cannot be used upon appeal from the original order setting apart the homestead. (Estate of Franklin, 133 Cal. 507, 508.) the description in the declaration of homestead was sufficient, and the erroneous description by sections upon unsurveyed lands cannot affect its validity. The declaration should be construed so as to uphold rather than defeat it. (Ornbaum v. Creditors, 61 Cal. 455; Schuyler v. Broughton, 76 Cal. 524; Keyes v. Cyrus, 100 Cal. 322; Simonson v. Burr, 121 Cal. 585; Estate of Levy, 141 Cal. 646. ) The designation by name and residence of the family was sufficient to identify the land. (In re Ogburn, 105 Cal. 97; Castro v. Gill, 5 Cal. 40; Ousby v. Jones, 73 N. Y. 621; Paroni v. Ellison, 14 Nev. 60; Trentman v. Neff, 124 Ind. 503.) The false or mistaken part should be rejected. (Stanley v. Green, 12 Cal. 165; Castro v. Gill, 5 Cal. 40; Raymond v. Coffey, 5 Or. 132, 135; 2 Devlin on Deeds, secs. 1038-1042.) The conveyances passed no title to the homestead. (Civ. Code, secs. 1242, 1243; Barber v. Babel, 36 Cal. 11, 18-20; Gagliardo v. Dumont, 54 Cal. 496, 500, 501; Powell v. Patison, 100 Cal. 236, 238; Gleason v. Spray, 81 Cal. 217; Sanders v. Russell, 86 Cal. 119; Hart v.

The Hudson River Railroad, Companyx are charged with the duty, under the acts of 1850 and 1854, in connection with their charter (1846), of keeping the gates and bars in the fences on the lines of then railroad in repair. And the failure to keep them in repair\", subjects them to liability in damages for any injury arising from such neglect. December Term, 1866. Appeal from- a judgment of the supreme court in the third district, affirming a judgment in favor of the defendants, rendered upon the decision of a single judge. The action was brought to recover the value of a horse owned by the plaintiffs’ testator, which was run over by a train of cars on the defendants’ railroad, and killed. The defendants’ road runs through lands that were owned by the testator, and at the time of the accident, fences were erected on each side of the road. On the evening before the injury, the horse was in a pasture adjoining the road, and during the night he escaped therefrom through a gateway (the gate being .out of repair), upon the railroad track, where he was run over and killed. It was admitted on the trial that no part of the fence was out of repair except the gate, and that there was no negligence in the management of the train. The cause was tried at the Rensselaer circuit, in February, 1864, before a justice of the supreme court, without a jury. The justice decided that the defendants were under no obligation to keep the gate in repair, and, therefore, the action could not be maintained. Lyman Teemain, for the appellants. John H.

One who hills another in self-defense is not guilty of murder, though he hore express malice towards deceased. 2. Self-defense: right op attack. It is not generally true that the right of self-defense does not imply the right of attach. One who has reasonable ground to believe that another intends to do him great bodily harm, and that such design will be accomplished, need not wait until his adversary gets advantage overhimj but may immediately hill the latter, if necessary to avoid the danger. 3. -: when inviting attack.

The fact that defendant claims that the hilling was done in self-defense does not destroy the right to an instruction based on the claim that . the hilling was manslaughter. Appeal from Douglas Circuit Court. — Hon-, W. N. EvaNS, Judge. REVERSED AND REMANDED. A. H. Livingston for appellant. (1) Tbe instructions as a’-whole are too strongly colored and emphasized for the State, and not broad enough to fairly cover defendant’s grounds of defense. They direct the jury to find defendant guilty. Instruction numbered 13 is not the law. It may be part of it, but not all of it. This instruction only goes part of the way, and stops short where it should contain the law for defendant under the facts. This court has lately expounded the law on this proposition in the Grugin case, 147 Mo. 39, and the rule of x-eason and common sense now prevails. While the trial court was not asked to instruct on manslaughter in the fourth degree, yet the jury should have been told the full law of opprobious and insulting epithets. - (2) Instruction numbered 11 is clearly erroneous. There is no evidence on which to base it. Defendant surely had the right to arm himself for protection against a mob and forbid it from destroying his property.. The jury were so told in instruction numbered 23. If so, then the instruction numbered 17 has no place in this case. If the principle sought to be declared in the instruction, was proper under the facts of the case, then the wording and phraseology are clearly erroneous, and not supported by any case in this State. “The right of self-defense does not imply the right of attack and will not avail in any case where the difficulty is sought for, or induced by the party, etc.” Nothing was said or done by defendant before the fatal shot except to forbid trespassers and warn them away. This he had a right to do. Wharton’s Grim. Law, see. 624. We insist that this instruction has no place in the case, and for its giving the judgment should be reversed. State v. Evans, 124 Mo. 397; State v. Robb, 142 Mo. 443. (3) Instruction numbered 18 is clearly erroneous because, if for no other reason, it singles out a certain fact and makes the whole case turn upon the finding of the jury thereon. State v. Sivil, 105 Mo. 530; State v. Bell, 70 Mo. 633; State v. Harris, 59 Mo. 556; State v. Smith, 53 Mo. 267; State v. Hundley, 46 Mo. 414; State v. William, 136 Mo. 293. Besides this instruction is not the law in any case. The appearances of danger may be false, not exist in fact; yet if they are such as to give the defendant g\\'ood reasons to believe their existence, he is justified in acting upon appearance. All the law of self-defense is annihilated by this instruction. (4) We submit that the caption of the instructions is erroneous and calculated to mislead a jury. Such caption is unnecessary, but if one is given it should contain more than the word “murder.” Edwaro 0. Crow, Attorney-General, and Sam B. Jef-FRies, Assistant Attorney-General, for the State. (1) The evidence in this case is sufficiently strong and convincing to support the verdict found by the jury, to wit, murder in the second degree. (2) The first assignment of error is the action of the lower court’s failure to instruct on lower grades of manslaughter than murder in the second degree, but defendant has presumably abandoned the contention. The testimony fails to disclose the remotest tendency to any offense other than that which was instructed upon. In view of defendant’s and all the other testimony in the case no instructions, other than for murder in the first and second\\' degrees and self-defense, could have been legally given. In this no error was committed. Where the defendant testifies that he shot the deceased in self-defense no instruction for manslaughter in the second degree should be given. State v. Stiltz, 97 Mo. 20. Nor can it be said that manslaughter in the first degree should have been instructed upon. There was no testimony upon which to base the same. State v. Lockwood, 119 Mo. 463; State v. Downs, 91 Mo. 19; State v. Sloan, 47 Mo. 604. By the unmistakable provisions of this section there can be no such instruction for manslaughter in the third degree, when the killing is as the evidence shows. State v. Pettit, 119 Mo. 410; State v. Dunn, 80 Mo. 681; State v. Watson, 95 Mo. 411; State v. Edwards, 70 Mo. 480; State v. Curtis, 70 Mo. 600. No instruction for manslaughter in the fourth degree was necessary. The evidence shows no sucb provocation as will reduce tbe offense to manslaughter in tbe fourth degree. Tbe act is admitted bj defendant, and bis excuse or justification therefor is self-defense. State v. Ellis, 74 Mo. 207; State v. Kotovsky ,74 Mo. 247. For all that is shown by tbe record, tbe deceased was going quietly about in tbe peace of tbe State, pursuing bis own work. It is true be bad previously procured tbe revolver, but for what purpose it was not disclosed, nor was sucb fact brought to tbe knowledge of defendant until after be bad gone to bis own borne, secured the gun, and ordered deceased to leave tbe rock in question unmolested. It is too well settled to admit of question that words alone, however provoking or insulting, will not reduce tbe killing to manslaughter, though they may reduce from murder in tbe first degree to murder in tbe second degree. State v. Branstetter, 65 Mo.. 149; State v. Elliott, 98 Mo. 156; State v. Barker, 109 Mo. 674; \"Whart. on Horn. (2 Ed.), sec. 893. We therefore submit that under tbe evidence tbe killing was either murder in tbe first or second degree or was committed in self-defense, and no error was committed by failing to instruct upon a lower grade of manslaughter. (3) Defendant attacks instruction numbered 17, and, as reason therefor, asserts lack of evidence to support it. In this connection tbe statement of facts by defendant is incorrect. While tbe defendant may have bad tbe right to request deceased to desist removing tbe rock in question) be bad no right, under tbe circumstances, to procure a gun and take tbe life of. a person deemed by him to be a trespasser against bis property, and who was in no wise trespassing upon bis person. Even though tbe defendant bad a right to tbe rock in question and tbe deceased was a trespasser, the civil courts were open to defendant for damages and tbe criminal courts open for punishment, which are presumed to be adequate in all cases. That tbe right of self-defense does not imply tbe right of attack, can not be questioned. It was so held in tbe case of State v. Starr, 38 Mo. 270, and confirmed in State v. Partlow, 90 Mo. 615. When taken in connection with instruction numbered 20, we find there can be no doubt as to the correctness of instruction numbered 17. (4) An objection is leveled at instruction number 18, and as reason therefor the statement is made, first, that it singles out a certain fact and makes the whole case turn upon a finding of the jury thereon; second, that it is not the law. TJpon closely observing this instruction it will be found free from the criticism made. The authorities cited by defendant in support of his onslaught upon this instruction are not in point. No such comment is made on the evidence or any part of it, as is condemned in the case cited. In fact there is no singling out and commenting on evidence as to its force or effect. It is merely the statement of a principle of law which would prevail in the event certain facts were found by the jury. It was a reasonable and necessary instruction, as much so as any other, in view of the circumstances and evidence in the case. (5) It is not within defendant’s right to complain as to the caption of the instructions, although it\\' was unnecessary to have affixed to the same the word “murder,” yet no injustice or prejudice could, under any circumstances, be worked as against the defendant.',\n",

       "  'case_summary': \"Kauffman versus Griesemer. The owner of the upper or superior heritage, may improve his lands by agricultural or mining operations, although thereby the volume of water discharged upon the inferior is increased, but he cannot make or dig new channels. But if in doing so, he causes a greater amount of water to pass on to the: lower premises, than the natural condition of the places would occasion, the owner of the latter may lawfully erect on his own premises, a countervailing impediment to such excess ; provided it doijnot intercept the passage of the water which would naturally pass on to his land. In favour of the agricultural and mining operations of the country, where necessary, the natural volume of the water may be increased, but new channels cannot be made for its passage. It is not error for the court to omit to charge upon every possible aspect of the facts, when not requested to do so by the party complaining. Error to tbe Common Pleas of Berks county. This was an action on the case by Franklin and Hiram Kauffmann, by their guardians, against Enoch Griesemer, for obstructing a watercourse, and throwing the water back on the plaintiffs’ land. After the road was vacated, and the trunk taken out of the watercourse across the road, and ®a ditch dug by the father of the plaintiffs, where the trunk, had been, the defendant' alleged that it increased the flow of water' upon his land from the plaintiffs’ spring, and to prevent it erected across the ditch or watercourse on his own land, a sod dam; and the flooding back of the water on the land of plaintiffs was the injury complained of in this action. The rest of the facts appear in the opinion of his Honour, Mr. Justice Woodward. The court below (Jones, P. J.) instructed the jury, as follows:— “ The defendant, by throwing up, at the line fence which separates his property from that of the plaintiffs, some sod and earth, have, it is alleged, formed a dam, which obstructs the accustomed flow and drainage of the spring, and rain and snow water from the superior land of the plaintiffs, through and over the inferior land of the defendant, and throws the same back upon the land of the plaintiffs. “ The declaration speaks of a stream of water being used to flow. There is no stream in the usually received sense of that word, as being a continuous flowage of water. The water that flowed down was such as came from springs which do not seem ever to have had a continuous flow that reached the defendant’s land, and such as came from rains and snows. But the accustomed, though not continuous flowage of such water, is a stream in the eye of the law, and its channel is no more to be obstructed than if it was the channel of a stream that never failed. “The general drainage of some 600 acres, or thereabouts, is through this meadow of the plaintiffs, over the land of the defendant, and thence towards the Manatawny Creek. In very high freshets it flows freely over that line. Whatever is the natural direction of the excess of waters in floods and freshets, as in seasons of ordinary water, must be left as nature has made it; no one has a right to divert it from himself, and cast it upon his neighbour, to save himself at the expense of another. “ What water was it that the defendant has obstructed in its flow-age ? The witnesses seem to say that no water ever reached the defendant’s land, even in freshets, until this ditch was cut by the plaintiff, which drained the collection of water, called the pond, above the road. (The court then laid before the jury, as to this matter, the testimony of Daniel Mattes, Jacob Yuengling, Hess, Manmiller, Enoch Clauser, Hill, Protzman, Reifsnyder, and Colin Griesemer.) These are the witnesses who speak to this matter; there may be other testimony in the ease which does not occur to us at this moment, but you will recollect how that is, and will ascertain the fact, as you will all other facts, for yourselves. If that were so, that no water ever reached the defendant’s land save in freshets, he would have a right to protect himself against any other water that might be cast upon his land than that which had been accustomed to flow there. But in so protecting himself, he must take care not to cast back the customary flowage upon the plaintiff. The defendant says that his dam, as it is called for con venience of speech, was never designed to obstruct the customary flow, before the water from the pond was let down, and could not have that effect. What the design may have been, you have nothing to do with. The effect is for your consideration. “ What water came down after the ditch was made ? Manmiller and Enoch Olauser say it was clear water. Was that so ? Was it new water, such as had not been accustomed to come down before when water did come down past the dividing fence ? If it was such new water, the defendant was not bound to receive it, and anything which he might throw up to prevent its flowage over his land would be a lawful .structure, so far as it did not affect the flowage of the customary water. “Doubtless one who has a stream running through his land, or a spring rising upon it, has a right to use the waters for his own purposes, returning them when used to their accustomed channels, and so he has a right to change the ditches on his land even though it throws more water on his inferior neighbour — they are artificial structures to facilitate the use of the water, and may be unmade or altered by the same right by which they were made. But one would have no right to introduce another stream over his lands into one already flowing there, so as to surcharge the existing stream with water, and raise it upon the inferior riparians. “ One has no right to alter the natural drainage so as to throw upon his neighbour waters that he had not received before. A familiar illustration of this would be the case of drainage from a roof. One may build his roof as he pleases, but not so as to throw the waters from it upon his neighbour’s adjoining lot. And as it is with a roof, so it is with the drainage of land itself: one may drain his land as advantageously to himself as possible, but he must not acquire that advantage at the expense of his neighbour. “ Each of the neighbours,” says Pothier, “may do upon his own heritage what seemeth good to him, in such manner nevertheless that he doth not injure the neighbouring heritageCustoms of Orleans, tit. XIII. One could not fill up natural drains so as to east more water upon his neighbours’ land — as for instance, by diverting a natural branch of a stream which had been used ab antiguo to carry off a portion of the waters of the main stream, which main stream alone was common to the two properties. He could no more swell the stream by cutting off a natural outlet of it, than he could do so by introducing another stream into it. He could do neither of these things to the injury of his neighbour lower down the stream. “Nor has one aright to cut away or drain natural reservoirs upon his own land, whereby he may recover the land occupied by the same, if thereby he causes more water to flow upon his neighbour’s land. • The recovery of the land is certainly for the advantage of the common weal, as well as of the person owning it, but such re covery is not allowed by the law at the expense of a contiguous owner. I have no right to make my property more valuable by making my neighbour’s less valuable. “Against injuries of this nature one may protect himself by necessary countervailing structures, and if some damage result to the party whose action rendered such structures necessary, not more however than may be unavoidable from a judicious and reasonable exercise of the right of self-protection, the party so damnified would have no just ground of complaint. “ To prevent the waters of floods and freshets flowing where they were accustomed to flow, the defendant could have no right. It was the plaintiff’s right that such water should flow there, and indeed all waters that had been accustomed to flow there. Any obstruction to any such waters would give the plaintiffs the right of action. Was this sod dam an obstruction of any such waters ? If it was, the plaintiff would be entitled to recover at your hands such damages as would compensate him for the injury he may have sustained — something at least to vindicate his right: if it was not, your verdict would be for the defendant.” The jury found for the defendant; and the plaintiffs removed the cause to this court, and assigned for error that the court, in commenting on the facts, and the testimony of witnesses, omitted to notice important facts and evidence in favour of the plaintiffs, and the instructions on matters of law arising in the case. Banks and Strong, for plaintiffs in error. The court should have brought every part of the testimony to the notice of the jury: Nieman v. Ward, 1 W. & Ser. 68; Parker v. Donaldson, 6 W. & Ser. 132; Brown v. Clark, 2 Harris 469; Bovard v. Christy, 2 Id. 267. The jury were instructed that if the opening of the ditch caused more than the customary flow of water on the defendant’s land, he was not bound to receive it, and anything which he might erect to prevent its flowage upon his land would be a lawful countervailing structure. That a person injured by a nuisance may commit a nuisance in turn. What would prevent the flow of the surplus water would prevent the passage of the natural flow. The defendant had his remedy by action, if he were injured. He might have abated the nuisance if it were one, and for this purpose have entered on the plaintiff’s land — his legal right was restricted to that: Ang. on W. C. 139, 40, 41, 42; Gale and Whately on Eas. 290; Dyer v. Depin, 5 Wh. 597; Cooper v. Marshall, 1 Barr 259; Spigelmoyer v. Walter, 3 W. & Ser. 542; Williams v. Gale, 3 H. & J. 231. H. W. Smith, for defendant in error. There was no prayer for specific direction on the facts, and the plaintiffs cannot com plain that the court omitted to give an instruction which they did not ask. What the defendant did was merely to protect himself against the flooding of his land. That the water of rain, snow, and freshets still passes over defendant’s land, is a fact established by the verdict of the jury. It would be singular if the law should allow a party to abate a nuisance by entering on the other’s land, and yet he could not protect himself peaceably and quietly on his own premises: Merritt v. Parker, 1 Coxe N. J. Rep. 460; Williams v. Gale, 3 H. & J. 231; Bentz v. Armstrong, 8 W. & Ser. 40; Ang. on Water Courses 138-100-136; 3 Bl. Com. 5; Gale & Wh. Eas. 291; Duncombe v.

Negligence—liability of State for injuries caused during automobile races held on fair grounds. Where the State, acting through the State Fair Commission, permits a race of high powered automobiles capable of the speed of sixty miles an hour, to be held on State fair grounds on a track originally made for horse races, and only protected by a wooden fence of flimsy construction, and incapable of resisting the impact of such machines, it is liable in damages for death or injury caused by a racing machine which when a the burst left the track and, breaking the fence, plunged into a crowd of spectators. The liability of the State is predicated upon allowing such races to be held upon such unprotected track, and not upon the fact that it failed to stop the races when it became evident that a the of the machine causing the accident was in a dilapidated condition and liable to burst. This, because there was not sufficient time for such action. The State Fair Commissioners are officers and agents of the State, and their acts are binding upon it, and a recovery may be had before the Board of Claims, for the State, by section 264 of the Code of Civil Procedure, has consented to be sued. Recovery may be had, although the Commissioners employed an expert to organize and conduct the races for a consideration, for the actionable negligence was in permitting the races to be held on such track, having no reasonable protection for spectators. The manager employed by the Commission was not an independent contractor, as it appeared that he was paid a stated sum as remuneration for his services. The spectators injured were not guilty of contributory negligence in standing by the fence surrounding the race track, as that was the only place, other than the grand stand, from which the races could be viewed. Appeal in the first case by the defendant, The State of New York, from a judgment and determination of the Board of Claims in favor of the claimant, entered in the office of the clerk of said board on the 13th day of February, 1914, awarding to the claimant the sum of $8,000 and interest, upon the report of a referee appointed to hear and determine the issues. Appeal in the second case by the defendant, The State of New York, from a judgment and determination of the Board of Claims in favor of the claimant, entered in the office of the clerk of said board on the 13th day of February, 1914, awarding to the claimant the sum of $500 and interest, upon the report of a referee appointed to hear and determine the issues. Appeal in the third case hy the defendant, The State of New York, from a judgment and determination of the Board of Claims in favor of the claimant, entered in the office of the clerk of said board on the 13th day of February, 1914, awarding the claimant the sum of $10,000 and interest, upon the report of a referee appointed to hear and determine the issues. Appeal in the fourth case by the defendant, The State of New York, from a judgment and determination of the Board of Claims in favor of the claimant, entered in the office of the clerk of said board on the 13th day of February, 1914, awarding the claimant the sum of $800 and interest, upon the report of a referee appointed to hear and determine the issues.

       "  'case_summary': 'Mary Zirngibl et al. v. Calumet and Chicago Canal and Dock Company et al. Filed at Ottawa October 29, 1894 Rehearing denied October 30, 1895. 1. Real estate — title from government draws possession to it. One holding title to lands derived from the United States is, by force thereof, in possession until there is an ouster or disseizin. 2. Same — presumptions arising from government title. Title from the general government being shown, presumptions in favor of its validity, and of legal possession under such title, arise, and remain until overcome by evidence to the contrary. 3. Same — presumption upon proof of deed of land by unidentified party. A grantor wholly unidentified, who is shown by parol to have made a deed which was lost, will be presumed to have been a stranger to the title. 4. Adverse possession — what are the requisites to constitute a bar. Adverse possession, to constitute a bar against the legal title, must be (1) hostile or adverse, (2) actual, (3) visible, notorious and exclusive, (4) continuous, and (5) under a claim or color of title. 5. Same — cannot be made out by inference or implication. The presumptions all being in favor of the true owner, adverse possession cannot be made out by inference or implication, and the proof to establish it must be strict, clear, positive and unequivocal. 6. Same — possession of part without color of title to the whole — effect. While possession of part of a tract under color of title to the whole is, in law, possession of all described in the deed, possession of a few feet of ground by a grave and a fence around it, in a small strip of land in general use as a burial place, while sufficient to establish title to the grave, will not draw to it title by prescription to the tract wherein such grave and burying place are located. 7. Same — when good only to extent of hostile occupancy. To the extent that the hostile occupancy would not afford one possessing the true title notice or put him upon inquiry, such possession does not operate upon the owner’s right. 8. Same —possession by bailiff for owner and adverse claimant jointly— effect. One in possession of land as bailiff for both an adverse claimant and the title owner, jointly, will, under the legal presumptions, be deemed to hold the possession for the title owner. Appeal from the Circuit Court of Cook county; the Hon. O. H. Horton, Judge, presiding. Edward Roby, for appellants: Twenty years’ adverse possession of the land is conclusive evidence of title in fee. Schoonmaker v. Doolittle, 118 Ill. 608 ; Riverside Co. v. Townshend, 120 id. 20; McDuffee v. Sinnott, 119 id. 449 ; Gage v. Hampton, 127 id. 87; Bicknell v. Comstock, 113 U. S. 150. One method of occupation may be more satisfactory than another as evidence of exclusive possession; but there is no rule of law that a title by adverse possession can only be gained by certain particular methods of occupation. (Eastern Railroad Co. v. Allen, 135 Mass. 13.) Each case must, from sheer necessity, be determined from its own peculiar circumstances, (Webb v. Richardson, 42 Vt. 465,) for the essential particular fades are as various as the nature and locality of real property, or the purposes for which it is adapted or to which the owner or claimant may choose to apply it. Clancy v. Houdlette, 39 Me. 451; Ewing v. Burnett, 11 Pet. 41. The possession of a wild island in the Ohio, subject to overflow, so that fences and buildings could not be kept on it, was held to be shown by exclusive use by annual pasturage. Webb v. Hynes, 9 B. Mon. 388. Inclosure is but one act indicating possession and claim of ownership. The possession must be by acts suitable to the character of the land, and being such, it matters not what its purpose. Bell v. Denson, 56 Ala. 444; Bowen v. Guild, 130 Mass. 123. When the lands are low bottom lands on a river, so subject to overflow as to be unfit for cultivation, and incapable of use except to raise grass and hay on them, the use of them for the only purpose for which they are fitted or capable, by constantly cutting the hay on them for twenty years, will be sufficient, and will constitute adverse possession. Merril v. Tobin, 30 Fed. Rep. 738. Where, under color of title, a person puts upon the land a substantial, visible enclosure, that is decisive proof of disseizin of adverse title. Cantagrel v. Von Lupin, 58 Tex. 577. Fencing and continued use of the land as pasture is sufficient possession. Cantagrel v. Von Lupin, 58 Tex. 570. The fence of Zirngibl, as maintained by his children, was, with the lake and river, a substantial and sufficient enclosure of the land. Jackson v. Halstead, 5 Cow. 216; Trustees v. Kirk, 84 N. Y. 220. Where the person enters under a claim and color of title he is to be regarded with more favor than a mere naked disseizor, and as entitled to all the land within the limits prescribed by the instrument under which he claims. Whitehead v. Foley, 28 Tex. 284; Angell on Limitations, chap. 31, and cases cited. Monika Zirngibl was guardian in socage of her children, and as such had a right to the possession of the land,\\'might avow in her own name, and could appoint Degnan to take charge and care of the land as bailiff of all the heirs. Byrne v. Van Hoesen, 5 Johns. 66. The possession or control of the mother was that of guardian in socage, and was a sufficient seizin of the land by the children. Doe v. Keen, 7 Term. Rep. 386; Goodtelle v. Newman, 3 Wils. 516. The possession of the tenant in subordination to the title of the landlord continues, notwithstanding any claim by the tenant or his successors of a hostile, title. Whiting v. Edmunds, 94 N. Y. 314; Jackson v. Davis, 5 Cow. 129. All who succeed to the possession of the tenant are tenants of the first landlord. Fusselman v. Worthington, 14 Ill. 135; Cox v. Cunningham, .77 id. 545; Doty v. Burdick, 83 id. 473. There cannot be a concurrent seizin of lands. 1 Wash-burn on Real Prop. chap. 2, sec. 76, p. 63. If a seizin by one be proved or admitted it will be presumed to continue till the contrary is shown. 1 Wash-burn on Real Prop. chap. 2, sec. 77, p. 63. No one who has a seizin and title to land will lose his seizin by any entry by a stranger, so long as he retains his possession. 1 \"Washburn on Real Prop. chap. 2, sec. 77, p. 63; 1 Salk. 246; Littleton, sec. 701; 1 Coke’s Inst. 368. Possession must be surrendered to the landlord before adverse rights can be asserted Doty v. Burdick, 83 Ill. 473; Brown v. Keller, 32 id. 151. The mere intrusion of a trespasser is not an interruption of the possession of one holding adverse possession under color of title. Ballard v. Hansen, 33 Neb. 861; Bell v.

       "  'case_summary': \"The City of Ottawa v. George W. Yentzer. Filed at Ottawa March 28, 1896. 1. Highways—by prescription—travel must be on a definite line. A highway by prescription is not created by public travel over the land generally, not confined to a definite and precise line, without any assumption of authority over it by the public authorities. 2. Same—effect of laying out road and filing plat when not followed by user. The laying out and filing of a plat of a road under the act of February 18,1837, providing that the road, when located, shall be a State road and be opened and kept in repair as other State roads are, do not constitute the road so laid out a public highway, where it was never opened or used for public travel and the public authorities exercised no authority over it. (Language used in Ferris v. Ward, 4. Gilm. 499, criticised.) 3. Evidence—of dedication of highway must be satisfactory. Proof of an actual intention to dedicate, or of acts and declarations equitably estopping the owner from denying such intention, must be very satisfactory to divest the owner of land under a claim that it has been dedicated by him as a highway. 4. Same—declarations of owner affecting dedication are admissible. The declarations of a land owner made at the time of doing acts claimed to have constituted a dedication, and also his subsequent declarations and acts, are admissible in evidence to show such owner’s intention. 5. Dedication—of highway—fencing out a strip is not a dedication. The construction of a fence by a land owner so as to leave out a strip claimed to be a highway is not conclusive of a dedication. 6. Same—fencing out strip believed to be already a street—effect. The building of a fence by a land owner, leaving out a strip in the mistaken belief that it is already part of a public street, will not constitute a dedication of the land. 7. Same—use of land as a highway by sufferance for several years not a dedication. That a strip of land was, at the time of a purchase, in 1889, and continuously thereafter, used as a road, and that the purchaser gave the city no notice of any claim of ownership until 1892, do not show a dedication, where the city did not, until a year after the latter date, attempt to do any work upon the premises, and the public use was merely by sufferance. Appeal from the Circuit Court of LaSalle county; the Hon. Dorrance Dibell, Judge, presiding. A. E. Wheeler, for appellant: Slight deviations in the line of travel, to avoid a temporary obstruction, will not defeat the prescriptive right. Gentleman v. Soule, 32 Ill. 278. Where a public road runs across private property, and is used by the public without interruption for twenty years, the owner acquiescing in such user, the law presumes a dedication. Green v. Oakes, 17 Ill. 251. The interruption, to defeat the right by prescription, must be an interruption of the right, and not simply the use or possession. Toof v. Decatur, 19 Ill. App. 208. The user of a road by the public as a public highway for the period of twenty years confers the right to use it against the true owner. Daniels v. People, 21 Ill. 442; Town of Lewiston v. Proctor, 27 id. 419. No particular form is required to the validity of a dedication. It is purely a question of intention.' Maywood Co. v. Village of Maywood, 118 Ill. 69. Although an owner may never have intended to dedicate, yet his actions may have been such as to equitably estop him from denying such intention. Chicago v. Hill, 124 Ill. 653; Waggeman v. North Peoria, 42 Ill. App. 138. The fencing out of a strip of land by the owner affords very strong evidence of its being left out for a street, and should be accepted as satisfactory evidence of a dedication. Chicago v. Hill, 124 Ill. 653; O'Connell v. Bowman, 45 Ill. App. 666; Maltman v. Railroad Co. 41 id. 236. Any act on the part of the public which manifests an intention to accept, such as public travel and use as a highway, is as satisfactory evidence of acceptance as repairs by the officers. Marcy v. Taylor, 19 Ill. 636; Storm v. Burger, 43 Ill. App. 175; Littler v. Lincoln, 106 Ill. 368. The general public can manifest its acceptance by using the road, and thus acquire a right of way. People v. Comrs. of Highways, 52 Ill. 501. The public is an ever-existing grantee, capable of taking dedications for public uses, and its interests are a sufficient consideration to support them. Cincinnati v. Lessees of White, 6 Pet. 431. Acceptance on the part of the public will be presumed from slight circumstances. Mann v. Elgin, 24 Ill. App. 423. E. 0. Swift, and Snow & Hinebaugh, for appellee: The subsequent act of Rees in fencing up the strip and using it for a long time overcomes any presumption of dedication or intent to dedicate.

       "  'case_summary': \"Philip S. Staats and others, Executors, &c., of Jehoiakim P. Staats, Appellants, v. The Hudson River Railroad Company, Respondents. The provisions of the forty-fourth section of the act of 1850, requiring railroads to maintain upon the sides of their roads fences, with openings or gates or bars therein, for the use of the proprietors of the adjoining land, is not inconsistent with any of the provisions of the special charter granted to the defendants in 1846. That provision, in defendant’s charter, permitting adjoining landowners to maintain gates or bars in fences along their road, imposed no duty upon such landowners to make such openings in such fences, and, consequently, the provisions of said fprty-fourth section of the act of- 1850 do not conflict with such provision in their charter.. The provisions of the railroad acts requiring the erection and maintenance of suitable fences, gates, etc., is to be considered, among other things, a safeguard for the protection of the lives of the traveling public, and, to that extent, a police regulation. Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme' Court, in the third district, affirming a judgment in favor of the defendants, rendered upon the decision of a single judge. The action was brought to recover the value of a horse owned by the plaintiffs’ testator, which was run over by a train of cars on the defendants’ railroad, and killed. The defendants’ road runs through lands that were owned by the testator, and, at the time of the accident, fences were erected on each side of the road. On the evening before the injury, the horse was in a pasture adjoining the road, and during the night he escaped therefrom through a gateway (the gate being out of repair), upon the railroad track, where he was run over .and killed. It was admitted on the trial that no part of the fence was out of repair, except the gate, and that there was no negligence in the management of the train. The cause was tried at the. Rensselaer Circuit, in February, 1864, before a justice of the Supreme Court, without a jury. The justice decided that the defendants were under no obligation to keep the gate in repair, and, therefore, the action could not be maintained. Lyman Tremain, for the appellants. John H.

Such adjacent owners or occupiers do not occupy. the position of licensees or of invitees.

       "  'case_summary': \"William R. Randal v. Peter P. Elder. 1. Homestead — One Body, or Tract, only. A homestead, under the homestead exemption laws, must consist of only one tract or body of land. 2. Streets and Alleys, in Cities; Title in County. In this state the fee-of all streets, alleys and other public grounds which have been dedicated to the use of the public by the proprietors of any town or city, is vested in the county in which such streets, alleys or other public grounds are-situated, and not in the abutting or adjacent lot-owners. 3. Adjoining Lots — One Tract. Two or more lots or pieces or parcels of land may, when adjoining, and when united, constitute only one tract or body of land, and therefore may all be included in one and the same homestead. But where several lots or pieces or parcels of land claimed as a homestead, are not contiguous, but are separated by lands in which the person claiming the homestead has no title or interest, such several lots or pieces or parcels of land cannot be included in or constitute one and the same homestead. 4. --Title of Homestead Claimant. It is not necessary that all adjoin. ing lots or pieces or parcels of land be held by an absolute title in fee simple, or by the same title, or even by the same kind of title, in order that they may all constitute one homestead; but it is necessary that they all be held by some kind of title or interest different from that which the whole public may have in the property. 5. Easement — Homestead, Bight. An easement may be created upon or through the land — such as a common road, a railroad, or a water privilege— without in any manner affecting its character as a homestead; for in such a case the owner of the land still owns the fee to that portion of the land over which the easement is created, as well as to the rest of the-land. 6. License ; Occupancy of Streets and Alleys. The plaintiff purchased certain town lots on both sides of an alley after the town was laid out and platted, but before the plat was recorded. The proprietors of the town, from whom the plaintiff purchased the lots agreed at the time of the purchase that he might fence up the intervening alley, but they did not sell the alley to him. The proprietors afterward filed a plat of the town with the register of deeds, and after that they executed to the plaintiff a deed for the lots, but did not execute to him a deed for the alley, and it was never understood or expected that they should do so. After said purchase the plaintiff took possession of said lots and the intervening alley, fenced the same in one inclosure, and has occupied the same as a homestead ever since: held, that said agreement of the proprietors was-at most only a parol license, and gave no right, title or interest to the plaintiff in or to the alley, and therefore that it and the subsequent possession of the plaintiff cannot affect any of the other questions involved, in this case. Error from Franlclin District Court. Action by Randal, under § 594 of the code, to determine the adverse estate or interest of Elder in lots 1, 3, 5 and 7 in block 32 in the city of Ottawa. In 1864 the Ottawa Town Company sold to Randal lots 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, in said block 32, which, at that time, had been surveyed and staked off, but its plat had hot yet been filed of record. A twenty-foot alley runs through the block — the odd-numbered lots being on one side of the alley, and the even-numbered lots on the other. Randal at once inclosed the lots and alley-between in one inclosure — the whole being less than one acre — erected his residence upon lots 2 and 4, and his stable on lots 1 and 3, and then occupied the same, as a residence, with his family, and they have resided there ever since. Afterward, in February 1865, the Town Company filed their plat for record, according to the statute, and on the 30th of October 1867 gave Randal a warranty deed for said ten lots. This deed made no mention of the alley space, between the lots — and the Town Company never' made him a deed for that space. In 1870 lots 1, 3, 5 and 7 were sold by the sheriff of Franklin county under a judgment duly recovered in the Franklin district court in that year against Randal. H. P. Welsh purchased said lots at said sale, and afterward conveyed them to Elder, the defendant. The action was tried at the March Term 1873 of the district court. The court found in favor of Elder, and gave judgment against Randal for costs; and Ra/ndal now brings the case here for review. John W. Deford, for plaintiff in error: The-only question is, are lots 1, 3, 5 and 7 a part of Randal’s homestead? If they are, the judgment was'not a lien upon them, and the levy, sale, and sheriff’s deed are void. Upon the admitted facts, the court below found, as conclusion .of law, that distinct parcels of ground in an incorporated city, separated by a regularly laid-out and platted alley, u cannot be included in one homestead.” In this the court erred. As matter of law, there never has been any alley between the lots. Undoubtedly, the town company projected an alley there, but it was, never established. - Says the plaintiff in his testimony, “The town company proposed to me, that, if I would give up lots 12,14,16 and 18 they would give me instead of them lots 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9, and would also allow me to fence up- the alley between, so as to make one inclosure. I accepted the proposition, at once took possession, inclosed all the lots and the alley intervening in one inclosure, erected my dwelling on lots 2 and 4, and my stables on lots 1 and 3.” And this was done, long before the town company had filed their plat, as required by law, and, consequently, before the alley in question, or any interest therein, had vested in the public. But if any alley did, or could exist under these circumstances, there is stil'l authority for saying that it was wholly extinguished by Randal’s taking and holding it in possession: 67 Penn. St., 11; Am. Law Reg., 196. But, were it a fact that the premises were “separated by an alley 20 feet wide,” still, I contend, the court erred in its conclusion of law. 15 Wis., 638; 17 Texas, 582; 46 N. H., 43; 33 Cal., 220. Welsh & Benson, for defendant in error: 1. The first inquiry presented is, what is a homestead within the meaning of § 9, art. 15 of the constitution? The language is, “One acre within an incorporated town or city, occupied as a residence by the family of the owner, together with all the improvements on the same.” Certainly, it cannot be reasonably inferred from this language that it was meant to include various tracts of lands scattered through an incorporated town, amounting in the aggregate to no more than one acre. The expression, “one acre of ground,” implies a compact body — a single tract, lands lying contiguous. If' lots separated by an alley are to be included, why may not lots in remote parts of the city? If separated by an alley, why not by a block, or a number of blocks? We see no dif ference in principle. And where should we fix the limit? 15 Wis., 638; 15 Minn., 116. 2. Under our laws, an alley is public ground, the title to •which rests in fee simple in the county, and is not a mere easement; hence, the remark contained in the opinion of the court in 15 Wisconsin, 638, supra, to the effect that the lots might be separated by'a mere “easement,” as a highway, does not apply here.

Notice to the principal and janitor of a public school of New York City, and to the inspector of its board of education, of any dangerous accumulation of snow and ice on the sidewalk in front of the school premises, is not notice to the city; such persons being employés of such board which is an independent corporation, vested with the management and control of the city’s property appropriated to educational purposes.

In ejectment for a strip of land adjoining that of the defendant, it was claimed by him that the line between his land and that of the plaintiff had become established by the verbal agreement and acquiescence of the plaintiff, so that the strip-of land in dispute had become a part of defendant’s land, And it is held that the defendant had a right to make this defense in said suit. 2. Mere non-interference by the plaintiff with the defendant’s-occupancy of the disputed strip of land will not constitute a, defense until such occupancy has ripened into a title by adverse possession, unless there has been some agreement, express or implied, fixing the disputed line so as to entitle the defendant to such occupancy; but an acquiescence for less than the statutory period, under circumstances which imply an assent, and which has been followed by a change in the condition of the parties, made on the strength of such acquiescence, is sufficient; citing Smith v. Hamilton, 20 Mich. 433; Joyce v. Williams, 26 Id. 332; Cronin v. Core, 38 Id. 381;. Bird v. Starh, 66 Id. 654; Jones v. Pashby, 67 Id. 459. 3. Where in such a case there is room under the testimony for-the jury to say that the assent of plaintiff to the location of the line as claimed by the defendant depended upon defendant’s establishing such location by a survey, and that, when the plaintiff saw the defendant erecting a building up to the line as claimed by him, it was upon the understanding that the defendant had located said line by an actual survey of the land, the question whether or not there has been such an acquiescence as to estop the plaintiff is for the jury. 4. In an action of ejectment involving a disputed boundary line,. a surveyor, who had made a survey of the property, testified that he had taken pains to establish the correctness of a stake designating a section corner, used by him as a starting point;, that he had used it for many years as a surveyor; that he knew it to be approximately the location of the original government section corner; that he had used said corner as thus located so frequently with reference to other surveys that he was perfectly sure of its correctness; and that, if it were not correct, the street to the north and the street to the west and the abutting lots would all be thrown out of line. And it is held that the witness was shown by this testimony to be sufficiently familiar with the location of the stake to justify the inference by the jury that he had correctly located the starting point of his survey.

Action — misjoinder of causes. — A complaint which alleged that defendant railroad company acquired a right of way over land of which plaintiff was in possession as tenant, and that another defendant, a contractor employed to construct the railroad, entered the land and destroyed part of plaintiff’s crops, without plaintiff’s consent, does not misjoin two causes of action, but states a single cause of action for a joint tort for the destruction of crops. (Page 372.) 2. Railroad — liability por contractor’s tort. — A railroad company which has authorized and directed a contractor to build its road upon land which it has acquired subject to an existing lease is liable as a joint tort feasor with the contractor and his servants for damages done by them, in the prosecution of the work, to the crops of the lessee. (Page 372.) 3. Same — LIABILITY POR CROP DESTROYED — CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE. — • A lessee was not guilty of contributory negligence in planting crops upon the leasehold after a railroad company had filed for record a deed from the lessor for right of way across the land, where the railroad had acquired no right of way as against him. (Page 373.) 4. Same — duty op owner to protect crop. — In an action for damages against a railway company for injuries caused to growing crops by throwing down plaintiff’s fences, the measure of plaintiff’s duty to exert himself to lessen his damages is such care and diligence as a man of ordinary prudence would use under the circumstances. (Page 373.) Appeal from Sebastian Circuit Court, Fort Smith District; Styles T. Roive, Judge; affirmed. Oscar L. Miles, for appellants. 1. The record of the deed conveying right of way to the railway company was notice to appellee that it had acquired the right of way. Kirby’s Digest, § 762. Under the law the appellee could only recover the fair rental value of the land included in the right of way for the remaining period of his lease. He could not enhance or exaggerate his damages by following up the engineers and planting a crop where they had driven the location stakes for the line of railroad. 67 Ark. 375. If a party can, at a trifling expense or by reasonable exertions, avert the damages caused by the wrongful act of another, it is his duty to do so. If he fails therein, he is entitled to recover only such damages as were not the result of his negligence or omission. 67 Ark. supra; 44 Mo. 303. 2. There was a misjoinder of causes of action and of parties. It is apparent that the contractor to whom was let the construction of the railroad across the leasehold estate could not be held for the taking of the right of way by the railway company, and it is equally true that the latter, having let the construction of its line across the leasehold estate to an independent contractor, could not be held liable for the negligent acts of the employees of that contractor. 52 Ark. 503; 54 Ark. 424. The court therefore erred in permitting the case to proceed jointly against the railway company and the independent contractor for two separate causes of action, and in permitting a joint verdict against them for injuries flowing from separate causes and sources. Brizzolara & Fitzhugh, for appellee. 1. It is proved that appellee had rented the land long before appellant acquired its right of way, and was in possession thereof. Fie had the legal right to cultivate the whole field until the railway company had settled with him. The deed to the right of way in no way described the boundaries of the strip conveyed, the only limitation being that the-road should not be built within 50 feet of the improvements on the place. The measure of appellee’s duty was submitted to the jury in the court’s fourth instruction, wherein they were told that if plaintiff by reasonable exertions could have averted the damages caused by defendant’s wrongful act it was his duty to do so, and if he failed to perform the full measure of his duty in protecting his crops he could recover such damages only as were not the result of his • negligence or omission. 38 Iowa, 518; 43 Iowa, 96; 1 Sutherland on Dam.

Testamentary devise to widow, providing that she should at her pleasure retain the homestead estate so long as she should wish personally to occupy it, and providing further: “My wife has expressed a wish to purchase” (the homestead estate) “I have no objection. Not less than $12,000 should be paid for it. The estate thus purchased should be subject to her disposal by will or should she die intestate should descend to her heirs at law. ” Testator devised to his sons certain lots, including the lot later referred to as the “front lot,” on the homestead estate, and the will further provided: “If the tract next north of the three portions herein last devised shall within two years have been bought by my wife, and with the understanding that the estate thus acquired shall descend to the sons, one or all whom she has brought forth, then this devise of the lots next south of the lane to the water fence shall be void in so far as the front lot is concerned.” This lot he devised to his daughter D.

On the above facts: — ■ Held, that it was the intention of testator that the widow, if she purchased the estate, should take an estate in fee simple; that, if she had seen fit to provide in some legal manner that the estate should at her death go to her sons, the contingency anticipated in the will would have arisen, and the devise of the “front lot” would have been annulled. Held, further, that, the widow having put it out of her power to do so by her conveyance in fee, the devise of the lot was not rendered void, and the title thereto remained vested in the sons as provided by the will.

(2) The possession of defendant of the premises in dispute, for a period far exceeding the limitations imposed by the statute, has, in the absence of any conveyance extinguishing it, ripened into a title in fee. Rassieur & Schnurmacher for respondent. (1) In ejectment, when plaintiff and defendant claim through a common source of title, it is sufficient for the plaintiff to deduce his title from the common source; to that extent the rule that he must recover on the strength of his own title is departed from.

(2) The possession of a tenant for life is not adverse to the reversioner or remainder-man.

       " {'case_name': 'Brown v. Bocquin',\n",
       "  'case_summary': 'Brown v. Bocquin. Opinion delivered December 24, 1892. 1. Adverse possession — Facts held not to constitute. Fitful acts of ownership of land situated in a city, such as permitting persons on two occasions to use part of the land as a lemonade stand for a day at a time, and causing some paving stones for a sidewalk to he deposited on the land, are not sufficient, in connection with the payment of taxes and the open claim of title, to constitute adverse possession of the land as against the owner of the legal title. 2. When adverse possession begins. Where adverse possession is relied upon to give title, the burden of showing the beginning of such possession is upon the party who relies upon the fact of possession; and where the proof shows that the possession began somewhere between the years 1870 and 1872, it cannot be said to fix the date earlier than the latter part of the year 1871. 3. Decree quieting title conclu,sive as to possession. Under the rule of practice in equity that an action to quiet title must be based on possession in the plaintiff, proof that a decree was rendered in such an action in favor of the plaintiff justifies the presumption that the plaintiff was in possession, and concludes the defendant from disputing that fact in a subsequent controversy with the plaintiff. 4. Purchaser pendente lite concluded by judgment. Where, pending a suit to remove a cloud upon title, a mortgage of the land is executed by the defendant, the mortgagee will be bound by a decree subsequently rendered against the defendant. 5. Partition— When not binding — Election. One who wrongfully claimed an undivided sixth interest in a tract of unoccupied land received from the owners of the other five sixths a deed conveying a sixth part of the land in severalty. The true owner of the undivided sixth interest did not assent to such partition, but elected to claim an undivided sixth interest in the entire tract. Held, that a purchaser of such interest from the true owner cannot, after the lapse of twenty years, elect to hold the tract so conveyed in severalty, to the prejudice of an innocent purchaser, but will be entitled to recover only an undivided sixth interest therein. 6. Evidence held to establish adverse possession. Evidence that a tract of land was fenced by one who claimed to own it, that a well was dug by her on it, that a brick-making plant was erected, and that part of the land was used for obtaining clay, is sufficient to establish adverse possession against the owner of the paper title. 7. When possession of co-tenant adverse. Where a co-tenant takes possession of the estate in common, under a deed which purports to convey the entire estate, and expressly repudiates the claim of title of her tenant in common, her possession is adverse, and sets the statute running in her favor. 8. What acts do not constitute constructive possession. Actual possession of ■ one tract of land, under a deed conveying three tracts, is not constructive possession of the other two tracts, where the latter are not contiguous to the former nor in apparent and actual use in connection with it. Appeal from Sebastian Circuit Court in Chancery, Fort Smith District. Fdgar F. Bryant, Judge. Jos. M. Hill for appellant. 1. Appellant’s title to one-sixth is paramount to appellee’s. The Meador judgment was a lien upon the sixth interest, and the marshal’s deed related back, thus cutting off the alienation by Datham to Stryker, and by Woods Rogers to Latham. 2. Appellant was entitled to be substituted and subrogated to the interest of Stryker, and have title not only to one-sixth but to all the property in suit. Stryker had but a colorable title, and one subsequently by suit vested in Hershey. Tiedeman on Real Prop, sec. 265; 1 Wash. R. P. (4th ed.) top p. 687, sec. 15; Freeman on Par. & Co-Ten. secs. 409, 531. 3. Appellee cannot set up her title as to one-sixth of the property because (1) she was a purchaser with notice, as were her grantors ; (2) Stryker is estopped by res judicata, and appellee was a purchaser pendente .lite, and likewise estopped and precluded by the judgment. The judgment in the Federal ■ court was a lien upon the land. 12 Ark. 218; 12 Wall. 150 ; Black on Judg. sec. 413.

The purchaser under foreclosure takes the title of mortgagor and mortgagee.

Whatever authority McIntosh had to convey should have been recorded just as was required by the statute then existing, which prescribed that a power to convey must be recorded at the time the deed is in the clerk’s office. This was not done. This judge of probate of course was no more than any other individual when he signed the deed. All the power he had to convey was that derived from the board. His merely saying that he was judge of probate and president of the board did not make him so, and he was not one of those officers whose acts are prima facie valid. Nor did his assertion that he had power to convey prove his assertion. No one looking at the record of the deed could take it for granted that McIntosh had authority to make the deed; an intending purchaser or • creditor reading that record would no more be bound by it, than in any other case of a deed made by an attorney in fact, where power was not previously .recorded. 4th. The sale of these lots was made by the treasurer. The county commissioners had no authority to delegate their power to sell the county property. By this act Thomp. Digest, (127), they were empowered to -sell; as officers they had this power. It was a trust reposed in them for the good of the county. The county .looks to their discretion, judgment and honesty, and mot another’s, in the uses they made of this property. As officers with this delegated trust they could not delegate their trust to any one else unless permitted by statute, any more than a sheriff, k tax collector or commissioner appointed by a court to sell could delegate his power to sell without a statutory provision. 5th. But there is another objection to the introduction of this deed equally fatal. It was not made in. the name of the county of Marion, the grantee from-the United States. The court will see by the deed that the county of Marion is not once mentioned as the\\' owner of the lots, nor is it stated that the board of\\' county commissioners gave the power to sell, nor is it\\' stated who gave the power. Without evidence outside of this deed it would be impossible to say who-was the owner of the property and’who gave McIntosh the power to sell. There is simply his bold assertion that he had power to sell some lots in Ocala, and it-does not appear in the deed that these lots were in Ocala, or that the lots conveyed were parts of the lots, sold by the treasurer, or that they were any of the lots-the board ordered to be sold. It is but a conjecture as-to the facts regarding these matters. We refer the-court to the following leading cases on the point: Story on Agency, s. 450, note 1 on p. 559, 3d ed.; 1 Waits Ac. & Def., 236; Clark vs. Courtney, 30 U. S. Sup. Ct. R., page 140 and 151, bot.; Brinley vs. Mann, (Mass.), 48 Am. Dec. 669; Elwell vs. Shaw, 7 Am. Dec., 126; Fowler vs. Sherer, 7 Mass., 19. The court will observe that in all of these cases the names of the principals are clearly set forth, and-in. Brinley vs. Mann the deed stated, as in the case at bar, that the agent ‘ ‘ was duly authorized. ’ ’ In Elwell vs. Shaw, the letter of attorney was read. In all of them there was no doubt of the intention of the parties, but the deeds were fatally defective because not, made in. the name of the principal. We take it as the court said in Elwell vs. Shaw, the objection to such signatures is supported by all the adjudged cases relating to the point. Say the Supreme Court of the United States in Clark and Courtney: “This may look like referment,” but “it is certain that Combe’s case has never been departed from and has often been acted on as good law. ” If the question was res integra it might be better to adopt a different rule, but there is no instance in which that most wholesome rule stare decisis should apply, since it has prevailed for hundreds of years in England and America, and an innovation of it might cause endless confusion in the interpretation in powers of attorney. On these grounds we hold the court below should have excluded the deed from McIntosh to Child. II. We come now to the exception that the court erred in refusing to admit the copy of the deed from Child to Merry. It was properly refused. It is not the copy of a deed properly recorded. McClel., p. (215), s. (6), requires the execution of a deed to be proved by a subscribing witness. Sec. 1, McClel. (214), requires for a valid deed that it should be sealed and delivered in the presence of two witnesses. The affidavit of the witness to the deed states that the grantor signed the deed in his presence, but does not say that it was sealed and delivered, or that it was executed. Consequently it was not properly recorded. 25 Fla., R. Edwards vs. Thom., p. 222. III. The court properly refused to allow what purported to be the copy of a deed from Child to Merry to be read as secondary evidence. It was not shown that there was any original deed. The witnesses do not say that this is a copy of a deed they once saw. They do not say that they ever saw this copy. They do not say that they ever compared it with an original or that they knew anything of aboriginal. IY. The deed from Merry to Jackson had no witnesses. It is needless to say more than that this was properly refused. Y. The plaintiff attempted to show a title by possession.- There is no evidence that Plaintiff had cultivated or improved or inclosed the lots for seven years, as required by sec. (6) & (8), McClel. (182), and thus acquired title by possession. YI. The deed from the heirs of Merry was properly refused. It was not shown that the plaintiffs were in possession when the deed was made. The deed was not recorded when this suit was commenced. There was not, as we have shown, any evidence of a deed from Child to Merry. Consequently a deed from his heirs was of no avail. Nor does this deed avail in the attempt to show color of title, as no possession, much less seven years’ possession, was shown. YII. The court properly refused the instruction asked by plaintiff, that if neither party showed title plaintiff had a right to recover if forcibly dispossessed. This suit requires plaintiffs to recover upon proof of title. The plaintiffs had the right to recover possession, if forcibly dispossessed, in an action for forcible entry and detainer, but not in a suit like this where only title is involved. As this case stands, we are rightfully in possession, no matter how we got there. We had the right to take forcible possession of our own, if necessary to use force. The sole question here is, did plaintiffs have such a title as to justify the court in ordering to them a writ of ouster, not whether we had gone on the land by force or in any other way. If they don’t show a title we need not show any right to the jjossession we have. VIII. The court did no wrong in striking out the-testimony of Agnew, Payne and Long. Their testimony was for the purpose of proving title in plaintiffs by possession, having failed to prove a paper title. The court will perceive, in looking over the testimony of these three witnesses, that there was not a particle-of evidence to show cultivation, improvement or inclosure, as required by section (6 & 8), McClel., 732. But-granting for the sake of argument that there was error in this ruling, we say, that taking the whole testimony together, the verdict was correct. These facts are patent: That the plaintiffs did not show a connected chain of title from the Government to Jackson, the plaintiff, and that there was not title in them by the possession required by our statute. If the plaintiffs had had a. verdict, it must inevitably been set aside. Where the verdict is supported by the testimony it should not be disturbed by erroneous rulings if they do not prejudice. 5th Fla., 276; 8 Fla., 391; 6 Fla., 515; 25 Fla., 289. See also a case decided in this court, and to case in the 26th Fla., that a verdict will not be set aside because of the erroneous charge, if the verdict conforms, to the law and evidence. BRIEF OF I-IENDERSON & RANEY. The following views are respectfully submitted in. behalf of Mr. and Mrs. Haisley, who were defendants, in the Circuit Court, as they are here: 1. The trial court did not err in refusing to admit in. evidence the certified copy of the deed from J. Child to Horace Merry, against the objection thereto that the deed was not properly acknowledged or proven, so as-to be admitted to record. There was no acknowledgment for record, and the question is whether or not the proof shown by the certificate to have been made-by the subscribing witness W. S. Olmstead is sufficient to render the record actually made legal, and entitle the offered copy to be read as evidence. Of course the rule in favor of the admissibility of such copies is liberal. If there has been a substantial compliance with* the requirements of the statute as to proof of execution, the record of the instrument will be held legal,, and the copy, if .duly certified, will be admitted as testimony. Einsteins’ Sons vs. Shouse, 24th Fla., 490; Edwards vs. Thom., 25th Fla., 22; Summer vs. Mitchell, 29th Fla., 179. Nothing more than a substantial compliance is required, but this much is necessary; nothing less will answer. Olmstead swore to three things: 1st, that he saw Child sign the deed; 2d, Child, acknowledged that he signed it for the purposes mentioned in the deed; and 3d, that he, Olmstead, and Livingston, the other subscribing witness, signed the deed as witnesses. The first and second of these averments speak as to what the grantor did, according to the knowledge of the affiant, or, in other words, they tell what the affiant saw or knew that the grantor did the third relates only to the signing of the witnesses. The evidence contained in the first two clauses of this certificate proves nothing more than the actual signing of the deed, and acknowledgment, then and there, of such signing for the purposes of conveying the land as stated in the deed. There is no evidence in the certificate of Olmstead’s having seen any sealing or delivery of the deed, or of the grantor’s having ever acknowledged any such sealing or delivery. In Edwards vs. Thom., supra, the affidavit of the subscribing witness was that he saw\\' the grantors “sign the foregoing indenture and acknowledge that they did so for the pur pose therein expressed, and that he together with •J. W. Smith signed the same as witnesses,” and the court held the proof to be insufficient. Standing upon t-iie certificate of proof, the case just mentioned must be held to conclude the insufficiency of the proof in the case at bar. The only theory that can be resorted to overcome 7\\'chis conclusion is that the language of the affidavit, or certificate of proof, can be connected with the attestation clause and thereby give such affidavit or certificate of proof the effect to show that the witness saw both the sealing and delivery as well as the signing of tfche deed, or that the grantor acknowledged to such witness the sealing and delivery as well as the signing. In Edwards vs. Thom., the conclusion of the deed was: \"In testimony whereof the said parties of the first part have hereunto set their hands and affixed their seals on the day and year first above written, in the presence of the two witnesses subscribing, and the mortgage deed being signed and sealed by the grantors; and it \"was said in the opinion that there was in the body of the instrument “ no statement of delivery, even if the language of the certificate of proof was such as would connect itself with such statement, were it there and cured what might otherwise be a fatal deficiency.’’ Whether or not the certificate connected itself with the qnoted clause was not decided. There are cases .in which the body of the deed can be invoked in aid of the certificate, as in Summer vs. Mitchell, supra, and authorities there cited; but recognizing that it is the settled policy of the law to uphold the record wherever a substantial compliance with the statute is shown, or whenever it appears with reasonable certainty that the requisites of the law have been complied with (authorities, supra, and Hines Lessee vs. Longroth, 11 Wheat., 199), we still think that there is a substantial defect in the certificate, which no part of the deed can be made to supply. The law contemplates where the record is made on proof of a subscribing witness, that such witness shall swear in effect that he saw the deed fully executed, and that the certificate of proof, either in itself, or in itself and by connecting itself with the deed, shall show such execution of the deed. It is of course not necessary to state in terms that the witness saw the deed signed, sealed and delivered; any tantamount expression will do, but less will not do. There is less here; there being no evidence that the witness ever swore, or was even willing to swear that the grantor ever sealed or delivered the deed in his presence, or ever acknowledged full execution of the deed, the sworn evidence is thus deficient and can not be supplemented by evidence not sworn to. It falls far short of the case of Einstein’s Sons vs. Shouse; there the deed, as a completed act, was, notwithstanding the use of words held to be merely descriptive, acknowledged as being the grantor’s free act. 24th Fla., 494-5. The law requires of the subscribing witness sworn evidence of a substantial execution of the deed. The fact of it appearing from a written statement, or attestation clause, above his signature, that the deed was signed, sealed and delivered in his presence does not entitle the deed to record; such sealing and delivery are riot sworn to. The affidavit shown to have been made does not connect itself with the attestation in any way, nor justify the conclusion that the witness intended or meant to swear to such sealing and delivery. The affidavit can not be extended by pres.umption or intendment. Fipps vs. M’Gehee, 5 Porter, 413; Stanton vs. Batton, 2 Conn., 525; Bryan vs. Ramirez, 8 Cal., 461; Edwards vs. Thom., supra. The case at bar is clearly distinguishable from those like Summer vs. Mitchell, supra, and Carpenter vs. Dexter, 8 Wall., 513, and others, in which the presumption or identity are indulged; which authorities, as stated on page 208 of 29 Fla., do not make presumptions supply the statutory requirements of an express statement. The natural disposition to sustain titles, or such record, finds itself\\' obstructed in this case, we think, by the deficiency in the sworn evidence. Even if it be that common understanding here, as in Arkansas, will give to the expression “signed and sealed” an equivalent meaning to “signed, sealed and delivered,” as was held in Tuffs vs. Gatewood, 26 Ark., 128, we can not concede that the expression “signed” has such meaning, either here or in Arkansas. II. Striking out the testimony of Payne, Agnew and Lang, in relation to the possession of the lots, on the ground that it did not prove nor tend to prove possession on the part of the plaintiffs, was not error. (This testimony is to be found on p. 26-28 of the record). This testimony does not tend to-prove that the plaintiffs had possession prior to the defendants. There is no testimony tending to show that the plaintiffs ever had possession of the lots-; Payne “considered” himself in possession as the agent of Carn, but Carn is not the plaintiff here, nor is Agnew, and the possession of neither of them is of any moment; and even Carn had no possession unless it is to be inferred from Payne telling Agnew that he-might go ahead and use the property, and Agnew’s subsequent use of it. Payne’s representation of plaintiff was only to collect the purchase money due by Carn to them for the lots for which Carn had what was then believed to be a valid deed from plaintiffs; it was not as claiming possession for plaintiffs. There- was no controversy then as to the validity of Carn’s deed. Carn’s possession, if he had any, and Agnew’s, was in their own right, and not as holding for plaintiffs; it was not under an executory contract for plaintiffs, but adverse to plaintiff. Core vs. Faupel, 24 W. Va., 238; Ketchum vs. Spurlock, 34 Id., 597; Nowlin vs. Reynol, 25 Gratt., 137; The Society, etc. vs. Clark, 4 Pet., 480; Bradstreet vs. Huntingdon, 5 Peters, 402. III. In ejectment it is incumbent on a plaintiff claiming under deeds to show proper conveyances from a party having either title or prior possession, to put a defendant in possession to proof of his right. Dubois vs. Holmes, 20 Fla. 834; Jones vs. Loftin, 16 Fla. 189. This doctrine is subject to the qualification that the action may be maintained on a prior actual and unabandoned possession against an intruder thereon. Seymour vs. Cresswell, 18 Fla. 29; Simmons vs. Spratt, 20th Fla. 395; Ashmead vs. Wilson, 22 Fla. 255. Upon this record no prior possession has been shown in Merry, or any of his heirs, nor any title or possession in the plaintiffs; certainly none such as the law requires as a sole basis of recovery. This being so, the deed from Merry and wife, and that from the heirs of Merry to Elizabeth Jackson became immaterial, and there was, when plaintiffs rested, no evidence upon which the plaintiffs could have recovered against the defendants. The jury has found such a verdict then as should have been found had no testimony been stricken out. It will be seen that the plaintiffs had rested when the motion to strike was made. They did mot seek to introduce any other or further testimony. There is no room for contending that anything like a statutory title by adverse possession had been proven. There was an entire failure to prove anything of the kind, and had the original deed from Merry and wife been admitted, prior to the introduction of the testimony subsequently stricken out, instead of being excluded, as it was, it would not have been of any benefit to the plaintiffs, as they had shown no possession to-which the instrument could have been of any support; and.had it been admitted, the result would have been that it should either have been stricken out with the other testimony, or the court should have instructed the jury to find for the defendants, or, in the absence-of such instruction, the verdict must have been, as it was, for the defendants. IY. The plaintiffs having failed to show possession in themselves and to connect themselves with the title of any one shown ever to have had possession, we see-no harm to them in the charge that “in this case it was necessary for the plaintiffs to show by competent unbroken chain of title from the government down to the plaintiffs,” even if it can be held erroneous. Y.. There was no error in excluding the deed from Child to Merry; and the plaintiffs having disclosed their whole case and shown no right to recover the-verdict should not be disturbed. isTo other points seem to us to merit any attention.',\n",

[113 Pac. 745.] Meal Property—Parol Licenses—Mevocaiion—Injunction. . 1. Under the rule that a parol license is revocable at the will of the licensor, even though the licensee has expended money in reliance thereon whieh will be lost to him by the revocation, held, that plaintiff who, with the verbal consent of the owner of farm lands adjoining his own, had constructed a private roadway, of a permanent character, and at an expense of $1,200 and three years’ labor, from his dwelling to the public road over a portion of the latter’s premises, fencing it, was properly denied an injunction to prevent the heirs of the licensor from obstructing such way. Appeal from District Court, Beaverhead County; J. B. Poindexter, Judge. Action by O. H. Lewis against Margaret Patton and others. From an order denying a temporary injunction, plaintiff appeals. Affirmed. Messrs. Pease & Stephenson submitted a brief in behalf of Appellant. Oral argument by Mr. H. P. Pease. There are two important limitations upon the rule declared in Great Falls W. W. Co. v. Great Northern By. Co., 21 Mont. 487, 54 Pac. 963, since affirmed in Prentice v. McKay, 38 Mont. 114, 98 Pac. 1081, and Archer v. Chicago etc. By. Co., 41 Mont. 56, 108 Pae. 571, viz.: (1) Where there has been an express oral agreement between the adjacent land owners that A shall have a perpetual right of easement over B’s land, and A then makes improvements to his financial detriment, such right of easement will be affirmed by the court. (See Great Falls Case, supra.) (2) Where A makes improvements upon his own land in réliance upon an existing right of easement over B’s land, and B encourages, or fails to dissuade, him, the court will recognize the right upon which A relied. (Washburn on Easements, 4th ed., 112.) In no ease arising within this jurisdiction have the facts permitted the application of either of the rules just stated, and in no case has it even been argued that either of them exists. In the case at bar the facts appearing in the record make both of these rules applicable, and doubly distinguish this case from the Great Falls Case and all the decisions which have followed it. This first distinction above noted relates to a situation clearly different from that implied by the word “license.” A licensee is but one degree removed from a trespasser; he is upon the land of another by sufferance merely, and has no rights in futuro. If he has any equities, they are derived from the laches or negligence of the land owner. The situation which we distinguish is where the improvements are made under an express agreement for a permanent easement. Here the person making the improvements is in a totally different position from that of a licensee. He does not calculate upon the forbearance of the land owner, but proceeds upon a positive promise that his rights will never be questioned. In principle there is no difference between his position and that of a person in possession under a promise to convey—both agreements are void by the letter of the statute of frauds, but in each case the court suspends the operation of the statute, as invoked to perpetrate a fraud. (Cobba/n, v. Hecklen, 27 Mont. 245, 70 Pac. 805; Stevens v. Trafton, 36 Mont. 520, 93 Pac. 810.) The case best illustrating the situation here presented is Bindge v. Baker, 57 N. Y. 209, 15 Am. Rep. 475. See, also, Dempsey v. Kipp, 61 N. Y. 462; Wiseman v. Lucksinger, 84 N. Y. 31, 38 Am. Rep. 479. If the objection be made that the agreement here contended for was not specific and definite in terms, the answer is obvious: (1) that at no time during the life of Patton was there the slightest disagreement or misunderstanding relative to the right of way, and (2) that the language of the court, in the Great Falls Case expressly covers a situation like the present: “A verbal agreement, even if in the form of a license,” etc. (21 Mont. 502.) The consideration for the agreement has next to be considered. The outlays, expenditures and labors of the appellant in this, estimated at $1,200, are ample to support the agreement. To this proposition we cite: King’s Heirs v. Thompson, 9 Pet. (U. S.) 204, 9 L. Ed. 102; Neale v. Neales, 9 Wall. 1, 19 L. Ed. 590; Freeman v. Freeman, 43 N. Y. 34, 39, 3 Am. Rep. 657. The second rule upon which we found our claim is stated by Washburn on Easements, above. It rests upon the different manner in which the common law regards improvements made upon a person’s own land, and improvements made by him upon the land of another. When A has at great expense altered and prepared his own land for the use of an easement over B’s land adjoining, relying on B’s promise to recognize such easement, the common law does not regard him as having made such expenditures at his own risk; but, having been induced to sink money into his land for a certain purpose, it would be the grossest inequity to permit B thereafter to forbid the use and render such expenditures nugatory. Morse v. Copeland, 2 Gray (Mass.), 302, illustrates this distinction. (See, also, Dempsey v. Kipp, supra.) Mr. John Lindsay submitted a brief in behalf of Respondents, and argued the cause orally.',\n",

       "  'case_summary': \"BEAN v. BEAN. 1. Parties — Equity—Misjoinder—Pleading—Waiver. The claim that complainants having similar rights are improperly joined in a suit to restrain defendants from using a right of way over complainants’ lands, is waived by the filing of a cross-bill in which defendants pray for relief against both complainants. 2. Adverse Possession — Evidence—Easements. Evidence examined and held to show that complainants’ grantor was the owner by adverse possession of a driveway 14 feet in width connecting his homestead with a farm held by him and afterwards conveyed by complainant to one of the defendants. 3. Same — Beal Ppoperty — Color op Title. Entry upon and possession of lands by a person as his own, even without color of right, is sufficient to start adverse possession. 4. Same — Statute op Limitations — Prescription. The right to and the use of a right of way may be acquired by adverse possession or prescription the same as title to the fee of the land. 5. Same. Possession and use of the strip of land, connecting two farms, without any permission from the owner, and sufficiently visible or notorious to raise the presumption of notice, is evidence of an adverse claim' of title, although the driveway was never used for crops. 6. Parties — Easements—Judgments. A decree in a suit to enjoin a trespass ¡¡wherein defendants claim a right of way by prescription and ask affirmative relief by cross-bill, cannot affect rights of an adjoining proprietor who is not a party. 7. Adverse Possession — License—Bight op Way. Testimony showing that the owner of the land so used was unfriendly to the one using it, that the strip was fenced off and used exclusively by him for more than 15 years, and no one ever questioned his right to it, sufficiently shows a right by prescription, in the absence of evidence that the use was permissive or licensed. 8. Same — Requirements. Adverse possession must continue for the entire statutory-period, and have been actual, open, visible, notorious, continuous, and hostile. 9. Easements — Wav oe Necessity — Appurtenances. Where the grantor of lands, which have no access to a highway, owns the intervening realty, over which a right of way has existed to the highway, a way of necessity along the existing route, passes to the grantee. 10. Same — Voluntary Grant. An easement or way of necessity will pass by implication as well where the severance of dominant and servient estates is effected by legal proceedings as where the grant is voluntary, and it passes with each successive transfer of title. 11. Same. When the owner of an entire estate makes one part of it visibly dependent for the means of access upon another, and creates a way for its benefit over the other, and then grants the dependent part, the other part becomes subservient thereto, and the way constitutes an easement appurtenant to the estate granted, and passes to the grantee as accessorial to the beneficial use and enjoyment of the granted premises. 12. Same — Easements and Servitudes. Whether the grantor of the premises owns the passageway or has a right to its use by prescription, as an appurtenance to the dominant estate, the right passes with the grant. 18. Same — Way oe Necessity — Termination. An attempt to secure a passageway to the highway in another direction by agreement with an adjacent proprietor, does not defeat the way by necessity where the proposed new route proves to be impassable and worthless. 14. Same — Pleading—Amendments. A prayer in defendants’ cross-bill that the deoree declare an easement to exist along the east side of complainants’ property may be considered as amended so as to meet proof that a marsh obstructed the passageway and required that the route pass around it, and a decree may be entered accordingly.

Adverse possession &wkey;>IOI — Actual possession insufficient to give title to contiguous tract subsequently purchased. Where a person who has acquired title by adverse possession to a certain portion of a league purchases a tract contiguous thereto, the continued actual possession of the land to which he had acquired adverse possession without enlargement or extension so as to reach the land purchased would not give him title by adverse possession to land purchased; his possession of other tract not being extended thereto by construction. 2. Adverse possession <&wkey;ll5(4) — Inclosure by fencte and use for pasture for required period held for jury. In trespass to try title, whether plaintiff\\'s predecessor, who plaintiff claimed to have ac quired title by limitation under 5 and 10 year statutes, had kept the land continuously inclosed by a fence for any period of 5 or 10 years, and during such period continued its use and enjoyment as a pasture for stock, held for the jury. 3.

Adverse possession <&wkey;!4 — Mere fencing of • land without actual occupancy not sufficient. The mere fencing of land, though land is claimed under a deed duly of record, and taxes are duly paid thereon, will not, of itself, without the statutory contemplated \"use, cultivation, or enjoyment, give such purchaser title by limitation under either the 5 or 10 year statutes. 5. Adverse possession <&wkey;>ll5(2) — Possession at times by tenants for cutting timber held not to give landlord title by_ adverse possession as matter of law. That a grantee had several Mexican tenants who at times camped upon the 30-acre tract in tents for purpose of cutting timber for wood and charcoal, etc., and at times cultivated a smaE garden on the land, held not as a matter of law to give grantee title by adverse possession as against true owner. \\' Error from District Court, Jefferson County ; E.

Proof that complainant, on the morning of the day the bill to remove a cloud from title was filed, caused to be erected a post-and-wire fence around the lot and placed a “for sale” sign thereon, giving the address of her attorney as agent, is sufficient to show possession. 4.

This is a bill, filed on March 22, 1904, in the Superior Court of Cook county by appellee against appellant to set aside two tax deeds, conveying to appellant lot 24, block 8, in McChesney’s Hyde Park Homestead subdivision of the south half of the south half of the north-east quarter of section 22, township 38, north, range 14, east of the third principal meridian in Cook county, Illinois; the first deed being dated August 26, 1902, issued in pursuance of a sale on September 21, 1899, of said lot for the delinquent general taxes for the year 1898; and the other deed being dated Qctober 25, 1902, issued in pursuance of a sale on Novem ber 9, 1899, to one A. A. Timke for a delinquent special assessment, wherein the certificate of sale, issued to Timke, was afterwards assigned to appellant. The bill alleged that the tax deeds were invalid for a number of reasons, among which were these: that there was no valid precept or process for the tax sale, and that the delinquent list was filed in the office of the county clerk, instead of being filed with the clerk of the county court. The bill prayed that the deeds be set aside as clouds upon appellee’s title. The bill was answered by appellant, who denied the deeds were invalid, and alleged that he thereby acquired a valid legal title to the premises. Upon the hearing of the cause, after the introduction of documentary and oral testimony, the court rendered a decree on January 17, 1905, finding that appellee was the owner of the premises and in possession thereof at the time of filing the bill; that the tax deeds were void for want of valid process, as required by the statute, and were clouds upon appellee’s title, and decreed that the same be canceled and set aside upon appellee’s paying within five days the sum of $38.92 to appellant, or to the clerk of the court for his use, etc., which amount was tendered in open court to appellant by appellee, but appellant refused to accept the same; and it was ordered to be paid to the clerk of the court for the use of appellant, which was done. The present appeal is prosecuted from the decree so rendered. Jacob Glos, pro se, (John R. O’Connor, of counsel.) Arthur E. Beers, for appellee.',\n",

       "  'case_summary': \"Mary E. Brown, Respondent, v. Patrick Doherty and John Doherty, Appellants. A deed executed try one of two executors hewing a power of sale is void—when a party claiming under such a deed acquires a good title under the Statute of Limitations — an estate for life in a beneficiary entitled to the possession, distinguished. Where a will confers on the two executors nominated therein power to-sell the testator’s real estate, a deed of such real estate executed hy hut one of the two executors is void if both the executors have qualified and are acting. The 5th clause of the will of a testator provided: “ I give and bequeath unto my executors to be hereinafter appointed, the rest, residue and remainder of my personal and real estate, in trust, nevertheless, and I do hereby by this my last will.and testament, authorize my executors hereinafter appointed to rent, sell or dispose of the rest, residue and remainder of my said real estate, either at public or private sale as they may deem most advantageous to my estate and to execute good and sufficient deed or deeds for the same and to place the residue of the money after paying my just debts as hereinbefore direóted arising from such sale or sales, at interest and to pay to my said wife so long as she shall remain my widow, such income arising therefrom for the support and maintenance of my said infant children, during their minorship .or infancy. “ And after the said Margaret Dougherty shall cease to be my widow, I give and bequeath to my said children Patrick Dougherty, John Dougherty and James Dougherty, equal, share and share alike, all the estate, both real and personal, that may remain in the hands of the said executors at the time the said Margaret Dougherty shall cease to be my widow. ‘jAnd I do also authorize and direct my said executors in case of the sale of my real estate, as already provided for, to sign, §eal, execute and deliver good and sufficient deed or deeds of conveyance in the law for conveying the said real estate to the purchaser or purchasers thereof.” In 1878 real estate, included within the residuary clause, was sold at a public auction sale pursuant to advertisements published in the names of both of the executors nominated in the will. One of the executors refused to join in the deed to the purchaser, and such purchaser went into possession of the premises under a deed executed by the other executor. The testator’s widow died in January, 1888, and his youngest child became of age December 21,1889. In 1902 a grantee of the purchaser at the sale brought an action against the testator’s surviving children to determine their claim to the property. The plaintiff and her grantor had held the premises adversely since the execution of the deed. Held, that, assuming that the deed executed to the plaintiff’s grantor was insufficient to convey the legal title to the premises, the plaintiff and her grantor had held the premises adversely for a period during which the Statute of Limitations had run against any action which the executors as trustees or the defendants could bring to obtain possession of the premises, and had, therefore, acquired a good title to the premises; That the Statute of Limitations against an action by the executors as trustees to recover possession of the premises commenced running at the time the deed was executed ; That if, as seemed quite clear, the executors, during the continuance of the trust, held the legal title to the premises and represented the defendants, that period should be counted in determining whether the Statute of Limitations had run; That even if the executors as trustees were not entitled to the possession of the premises, the defendants, the testator’s surviving children, were at liberty to maintain an action of ejectment in their own behalf when possession was taken under the deed. The case in which an outstanding life estate or estate held for the benefit of another and where the life beneficiary of the trustee is alone entitled to possession, distinguished. Appeal by the defendants, Patrick Doherty and another, from a judgment of the Supreme Court in favor of the plaintiff, entered in the office of the clerk of the county of .

Where two adjoining proprietors of land are divided by a fence, which they suppose to be the true line, each claiming only to the true line, they are not bound by the supposed line, but must conform to the true line when it is ascertained. 2. --:-: agreed line Where there is a dispute as to the true division line between ad joining proprietors, or the line is uncertain, or they are- both ignorant as to its true location, and they fix and agree upon a permanent boundary line, and possession is taken, accordingly, the agreement is -binding on them and those claiming under them. 3.

Agreed Line, Evidence of. The agreement need not be shown by direct evidence, but may be inferred from the acts and conduct, and especially from the long acquiescence of the parties. 5. -. The evidence in this case held to show no such agreement between the parties. 8.-, One in possession of land, under an agreement on the’part of his father to give it to him, has such an interest therein as to make an agreement with an adjoining proprietor, concerning the true division line, binding on him. 7.

Appeal from Boone Circuit Court. — Host. Gf, H. Burckhaktt, Judge. Reversed. A. M. Hough for appellant. (1) The court erred in refusing instruction number seven, asked by plaintiff. There was no evidence upon which the court could find for the defendants on the ground of estoppel. The evidence in the case does not show a single element of estoppel. Acton v. Dooley, 74 Mo. 63 ; Donaldson v. Hibner, 55 Mo. 492 ; Bigelow on Estop. “525, 526, 521, 524; Kincaid v. Dormey, 51 Mo. 552 ; Bales v. Perry, 51 Mo. 453 ; Ormsby v. Ihm-sen, 34 Pa. St. 472 ; Hill v.

Prescott, 7. Allen, 494. (2) Instruction number seven, given for defendants, should have been refused. There was no evidence upon which to base it. There was no evidence, whatever, that, prior to 1879, or at any time, a' boundary line had been “established by mutual agreement made between the plaintiff and the person or persons under whom defendants claim title to their said lands.” The instruction makes a case for defendants not made in their answer, nor is the case made in the evidence. It is error to give an instruction where there is no evidence to authorize it. Parker •». Marquis, 64 Mo. 38; Weiland v. Wayland, 64 Mo. 168; Kreech v. Railroad, 64 Mo. 172; Clark v. Railroad, 64 Mo. 440 ; Lillis v. Railroad, 64 Mo. 464; Brown v. Insurance Co., 86 Mo. 51. (3) The seventh instruction given for defendants should not have been given, because plaintiff did not own the land when the mutual agreement is supposed, by instruction numbered seven for defendants, to have been made “between the plaintiff and the person or persons under whom defendants claim title to their said lands.” Estoppel in pais operates only on existing rights. It cannot be invoked against an after-acquired title. Donaldson v. Hibner, 55 Mo. 492; Barker v. Circle, 60 Mo. 258; Bigelow on Estop. 525. (4) Defendants’ seventh instruction is erroneous, for the reason that it states that “plaintiff is bound by said line, and is not permitted to dispute its correctness in the absence oí fraud.” Plaintiff is not attempting to estop defendants, therefore, he is not required to show any fraud onu their part. But as defendants are seeking to estop plaintiff, by their testimony, it is necessary that they should show that to permit plaintiff to dispute the supposed agreed line would operate a fraud on defendants. Plaintiff can only be estopped on the ground that he has knowingly deceived or misled defendants, or the-person or persons under whom they claim title, to their injury, and caused them to change or alter their position, and that it would be a fraud to allow plaintiff to deny those facts.

(5) The court erred in giving instructions one and seven, on the part of the defendants. Instructions should be framed solely with reference to the issues. It is error to instruct on issues-not raised by the pleadings. There was no plea of estoppel. Moffatt v. Qonklin, 35 Mo. 453; Qamp v. Heelan, 43 Mo. 591; Bank v. Murdock, 62 Mo. 70; Has-sell v. Bust, 64 Mo. 325; Hoble n. Blount, 77 Mo. 242; Benson v. Railroad, 78 Mo. 504. (6) The court erred in sustaining defendants’ motion, made at the trial, “allowing defendants to avail themselves of. the plea of estoppel, when they had withdrawn and stricken said plea of defence out of their said answer.” Facts relied upon as an estoppel in pais must be specially pleaded. Miller v. Anderson, 19 Mo. App. 71; Weise v. Moore, 22 Mo. App. 530; Bray v. Marshall, 75 Mo. 325; Noble v. Blount, 77 Mo. 235; Hammerslough n. Cheatham, 84 Mo. 13. Smith, Silver & Brown and C. B.

Appeal from Henry Circuit Court. ■ Thursday, March 19. This action was commenced in ordinary proceedings, on the 25th of August, 1870, to recover one year’s interest upon a note for $24,000, dated January 1st, 1869, due on or before the first day of April, 18S0, with interest from the first of April, 1869, payable annually. The defendants filed their answer and cross-bill in equity, praying the cancellation of the note sued on, and the mortgage executed to secure the same, and alleging in substance that the note was given in purchase of section 17, and the southeast quarter of section 18, in township 72, range 5. That plaintiff, with intent to cheat and defraud defendants, represented that said premises lay in a body, six and one-lialf miles from the city of Mount Pleasant; that there was a large amount of hedge fence in a good state of cultivation thereon; that there was no road, and particularly no diagonal road,' across the land in any manner separating the same; that there was on the land a valuable living stream. of running water, sufficient at all times for a stock farm for the whole of said premises. The cross-bill alleges specifically the falsity of each of these representations, and states that the defendants offered to surrender the lands, and have the note and mortgage canceled. At the time of filing their cross-bill defendants filed a motion to transfer the action to equity, which was sustained. On the second day of February, 1871, plaintiff filed an amendment to the petition, alleging that the note was executed for the purchase money of the land above named, and that a mortgage was executed on said premises to secure the same. That there is due $1,110, with interest from April 1, 1870, and $1,110 will become due. April 1, 1871. That 100 acres of the premises are improved with buildings, etc., thereon; that 610 acres are fenced, and that defendants have abandoned the q>remises. Plaintiff prays for the. appointment of a receiver, for judgment for $1,410 and interest at 6 per cent., and for such further sum as may mature on said note before decree, for a foreclosure of the mortgage, and a sale of the premises; and that the excess of proceeds of sale be applied to pay sums not due'on said note with proper rebate, and for general relief. On the 26th day of June, 1871, plaintiff filed an answer to the cross-bill, denying all its material allegations. On the 30th of May, 1872, plaintiff filed an amendment to his petition, alleging that another year’s interest has fallen due on the note, and that in order to preserve his security he was compelled to pay taxes on the mortgaged premises for the years 1869 and 1870, amounting to $101.02, and praying judgment for these sums. The court decreed that the defendants are entitled to recover the sum of thirty-five hundred dollars, on account of the mat ters set up in the cross-bill. That the contract is valid and binding, and defendants áre not entitled to have the same rescinded. That the amount of interest which has not been paid on said note, together with the taxes paid by plaintiff on the mortgaged premises is $5205.03, leaving due plaintiff after deducting the damages, $1,705.03, and that the -mortgaged premises should be sold to satisfy the same. That there are other payments secured by the same mortgage not yet due, viz.: the sum of $24,000, with 6 per cent, interest, payable annually. That upon the sale of said mortgaged premises, after first satisfying- the judgment herein rendered, the surplus be applied as follows: First, in payment of the principal and interest from April 1, 1872, of the note set out in plaintiff’s petition; and second, that if any balance remain due after satisfying said note and interest, such balance be paid defendants. The plaintiff excepted to the decree so far as it awards the defendants damages, and the defendants excepted to the remainder. The defendants alone appeal. John 8. Woolson, for appellant. JEE. & B.

Brown, executrix of the estate of Charles English, deceased. [Submitted April 1st, 1918. Decided April 3d, 1918.] Where a testator purchased a tract of land, and later an adjoining tract, after which he erected a house on the first tract and fenced in both tracts for a lawn, his devise of it as “my house” included both tracts. On final hearing on bill to quiet title. Complainant has filed a bill to quiet title to certain real estate in the city of Beverly. Defendants have answered admitting complainant’s peaceable possession and asserting an adverse title. No demand for an issue at law having been made, final hearing has been had on the issue of title raised by the pleadings. No dispute exists touching the facts. The isstíe of title is wholly dependent upon the construction of a clause in the last will and testament of Charles English, deceased. . That clause is as follows: “Third: I order and direct that my wife be suffered and permitted to occupy and have the use of my house in Beverly and its contents for and during the full term of her natural life, and from and after her decease, I give, devise and bequeath the same unto my daughter, Alice E. Brown, absolutely, if she be then living' or should she predecease my said wife, then I give, devise and bequeath the same unto my said wife, absolutely if she be living at my decease.” It is to be herein determined what land'passed by the above-quoted devise of “my house in Beverly.” Whatever land passed by that devise is now owned in fee by complainant by virtue of a deed of conveyance from Alice E. Brown, who survived testator’s widow. The material facts touching the issue stated are as follows: March 13th, 1885, one Diehl conveyed to testator a tract or lot of land in Beverly fronting eighty feet on the east line of Jennings street and extending easterly in depth one hundred and twenty feet, more or less. October 7th, 1886, testator purchased from Diehl an adjacent tract of land at the north and also in the rear of the land first purchased, the tract so purchased being in the shape of the letter “L” and embracing the land lying between the lot first purchased and Church street and land in the rear of the tract first purchased. This tract had a frontage on Jennings street of forty feet and extended along Church street one hundred and sixty feet and- embraced forty feet in the rear of the tract first purchased. By these two purchases testator became the owner of a rectangular tract one hundred and twenty feet in frontage on Jennings street and one hundred and sixty feet on Church street. Thereafter testator erected a dwelling-house on the land so owned by him. The dwelling-house was located on the land described in the first conveyance above referred to and a lawn was made by testator embracing the remaining portion of his land, and tlie whole was then surrounded and enclosed by a fence and no visible or distinguishable trace was left of the lines which originally divided the two tracts of land. The dwelling-house was then occupied by testator as his home during the remainder of his lifetime, and the surrounding land above referred to as a lawn was so used and enjoyed by him. Testator's will was executed while he was so enjoying his home. Testator owned no other house or home in Beverly. Defendants claim that the land secondly purchased by testator does not pass by the above-quoted devise of “my house in Beverly.” Messrs. Thompson & Smathers, for the complainant. Mr. Clarence E.

An assignment of error that the court in trespass to try title erred by leaving it to the jury to determine whether the breaks in possession and delays in recording deeds in the chain of title were reasonable, no testimony being offered on either of the issues, is not objectionable as submitting two distinct propositions of law, where the charge complained of so blended the issues as to make them inseparable in their submission.

The error in an instruction in trespass to try title on the issue of adverse possession relied on by a party that if the party and those under whom he claims have had peaceable and adverse possession for five years, and if there were suspensions in the actual occupancy of the land or delays in recording the deeds in the chain of title, the jury must determine whether the suspensions and delays were reasonable, and if unreasonable the adverse possession was broken, arising from a failure to define what constitutes a reasonable or unreasonable length of time, is not fundamental, and, in the absence of a request for a special charge correcting the error, the defeated party may not complain.

Adverse possession under deeds duly recorded, to constitute title under the five-year statute of limitations, need not be continued in the same person, but, when held by different persons successively, there must be a privity of estate between them, and they must successively acquire the interest claimed, and a suit must be brought within five years to recover the land against one holding by peaceable and adverse possession, cultivating and enjoying the same and paying taxes thereon, and claiming under deeds duly recorded.

Where a possessor sells his land and remains in possession claiming it, he breaks the possession essential to establish title by adverse possession. [Ed. Note. — For other cases, see Adverse Possession, Cent. Dig. §§ 213-225; Dec. Dig. § 43. ] 7. Adverse Possession (§ 82 ) — Acts Constituting — Breaks in Possession. Where a deed in the chain of title under which one claims title by adverse possession under the five-year statute of limitations has not been duly recorded, the possession essential to constitute title by adverse possession is broken.

Where a party in trespass to try title relying on adverse possession under recorded deeds introduced evidence explaining the dates of the deeds, and the homes of the parties and the surrounding circumstances, a charge submitting the issue whether delays in recording the deeds were reasonable or unreasonable was proper. [Ed. Note. — For other cases, see Adverse Possession, Cent. Dig. § 66; Dec. Dig. § 116. ] 10. Adverse Possession (§ 85 ) — Evidence— Sufficiency. Evidence held to justify a finding of acquisition of title by adverse possession under recorded deeds. [Ed. Note. — For other cases, see Adverse Possession, Dec. Dig. § 85. ] 11.Adverse Possession (§ 19 ) — Inclosube. Where the deeds under which a party claimed title under the five-year statute of limitations defined the boundaries, a fence embracing more land than the field notes called for, used as a boundary fence by permission or otherwise sufficient to hold stock, was a sufficient barrier to show possession of the land to ripen into title by adverse possession, in the absence of some adverse possession of a part of it by some one asserting a superior title. [Ed. Note. — For other cases, see Adverse Possession, Cent. Dig. §§ 99-105; Dee. Dig. § 19. ] 12.Trial (§ 327 ) — Verdict—Sufficiency-Disposal of All Issues. Where the verdict in trespass to try title awarded recovery of the land to various parties to the suit, by name and in quantities spec ified, an objection on appeal that the directed verdict was defective for failure to dispose of certain other parties not therein mentioned is untenable, where the court charged that such other parties could not recover, and that the verdict must be against them and in favor of whoever might recover, which charge was given effect by the judgment entered.

       "  'case_summary': \"Otis T. Hall v. The Peoria and Eastern Railway Company. Filed at Springfield November 2, 1892. 1. Statute op Fbauds—performance of verbal contract to take case out of the statute. A parol agreement for the purchase of land, when the purchase money is paid and possession is given and taken under the contract, and the purchaser makes lasting and valuable improvements thereon, will be specifically enforced, as such part performance is sufficient to take the case out of the Statute of Frauds. 2. Where the vendor of land for a railroad depot accepts the amount raised by subscription, when collected, in full satisfaction of the contract of purchase, the exact amount agreed to be paid will be a matter of no importance, especially when the vendor has the land surveyed and staked off, and removes his fences from the land, and gives possession. 3. Specific pebfobmance—relief based on offer in bill, though not proven to be a part of the contract. Although the vendor of a tract of land for a railroad depot is not shown to have been entitled to a railroad pass for himself and family, yet if the successor of the company with whom the contract was made, by his bill, offers such a pass, a decree for specific performance predicated on such offer, and making provision for its enforcement in the future, may be regarded as proper. 4. Laches — not attributable to party in possession of lands sold. Laches can not be imputed to a person who is in possession of the property in dispute under a contract for a deed. Until such possession is sought to be disturbed, the vendee is not required to bring suit „to enforce the making of a deed. Appeal from the Circuit Court of McLean county; the Hon. Alebed Sample, Judge, presiding. Mr. Thomas F. Tipton, and Mr. W. B.

       "  'case_summary': \"Wheeling. Boughner v. The Town of Clarksburg et al. Decided July 9, 1879. 1. Oourts of equity will restrain by injunction a town from constructing pavements on a person's land, where he has not dedicated the ground to public use, or where the ground has not been condemned according to law, for that purpo~e. 2. The principles asjaid down in Pierpoint v. Town of ffarrkville, ■!) W. Va. 215, as to the dedication of land to public use for a street, are equally apjilicable to the dedication of land to public use for sidewalks or pavements in towns. ¡1. Where the dedication is on condition, the terms of the dedication must be strictly complied with. Appeal from and supersedeas to a decree of. the circuit court of the county of Harrison, rendered on the 22d day of January, 1876, in a cause in said court then pending, wherein Daniel Boughner was plaintiff, and The Trustees and Commonalty of the Town of Clarksburg and others were defendants, granted upon the petition of said Boughner. Hon. C. S. Lewis, late judge of the second judicial circuit, rendered the judgment appealed from. Moore, Judge, furnishes the following statement of the case : This cause is presented upon an appeal from and su-persedeasto a decretal order, made in vacation, January 22,1876, by Hon.C. S. Lewis, judge of the second judicial circuit, dissolving an injunction granted said Boughner November 13, 1875, upon a bill filed by him against said defendants, to enjoin and restrain the defendants, &c., from building, erecting and constructing a certain pavement in the bill mentioned. The bill alleges that plaintiff is the owner and seized in fee of two certain lots on Main street, in the town of Clarksburg, upon which lots he has erected storehouses in which he is now doing business as a merchant, which lots were conveyed to him, &c.; that the trustees and commonalty of the town of Clarksburg, by its officers and agent, and employes, without the consent of plaintiff, and -without having first condemned the ground on the said lots in the manner provided by law, are now, to-wit, on this 13th day of November, 1875, building, erecting and constructing on the south side of his said lots, and entirely on the said lots, on the north side of Main street, immediately west of one of his said storehouses, in the said town of Clarksburg, a brick pavement; that said pavement, if permitted to be constructed, will entirely prevent the plaintiff from passing into his said lots to reach his said storehouses with his horses and wagons, as he hath hitherto been accustomed to do, and will greatly ’injure his business as a merchant. He further alleges that said trustees and commonalty of Clarksburg, refuse to make a crossing for horses and wagons across said pavement, if the same is erected, so that the plaintiff can cross and recross as he has hitherto been accustomed to do; the plaintiff therefore prays that the said trustees, &c. be enjoined and restrained from building, erecting and constructing said pavement on his said lots until they have condemned said ground upon said lots upon which they are erecting and constructing said pavement in the manner prescribed by law, and make a crossing for horses and wagons for the plaintiff over said pavement to pass into and from said lots, &c. The defendants, the trustees and commonalty, &c., answered the bill, and admit that plaintiff owns in fee simple the lots set out in the bill, but insists that all the ground on which the pavement is being laid, is not included in the lines of the said lots. In other words they ansAver, admitting they did direct the street commissioner in November, 1875, to construct the pavement on the north side of Main street, and on the south side of plaintiff’s lot,-from the southwest corner of said lot to the southeast corner of the lot owned by Holmes, and that said pavement was ordered to be laid and constructed without the consent of plaintiff. That the length of the proposed pavement is forty-one feet, and that plaintiff prevented them from proceeding rvith the Avork. “Further answering, the defendants deny that the plaintiff-has any right to obstruct or pre vent the laying of said pavement, or that the same, if laid, will interfere with any right of the plaintiff, or take any ground, or any part of said lot, to the use of which the public are not entitled. In other words, the defendants deny that the plaintiff has any right, under any pretense of title to the same, to prevent or obstruct the building of said pavement, or to deny to the public, the town of Clarks-burg, the use of the ground proposed to be taken for the same. If the plaintiff’s pretensions Avere true' e\\\\ren, and his denial of the right on the part of the toAvn of Clarks-burg to the use of said ground Avere well founded in fact, defendants insist and charge that his right to withhold such use could extend only to the ground embraced in the boundaries of his alleged title, and that outside of his pretended claim of title is a strip of ground over which it was proposed to lay and build said pavement, and the building upon Avhichhe unlawfully obstructed and prevented, that does not belong lo him but to the public, and the right to control which belongs exclusively to these defendants. ‘■'But the defendants, further answering, aver and charge that whatever rights the plaintiff might have had in said premises, so far as the exclusive right to use the same is concerned, have been surrendered by his own' acts and conduct by a dedication of said ground, to the public; that several years ago,perhaps in the year and prior to the erection of the brick storehouse now occupied by plaintiff and located on said lot, the plaintiff, in contemplation of the building of the same, and recognizing the power and authority vested by law in the defendants in respect to the erection of buildings within said town, and the regulation of streets, pavements, sidewalks and alleys, made a written application to the then trustees and commonalty of the town of Clarksburg, to establish' officially the grade for side-Avalks on both Main and Third streets, and also for an establishment of street lines, and for the usual permit and privilege to build on said streets; upon which application, the said trustees, &c., proceeded to establish the grades and lines of streets as aforesaid, and said plaintiff, in the erection of his said storehouse, conformed to the lines and grades on said street as thus established, as these defendants are informed and believe. A copy of said application in' writing is here filed marked “A.” “Further answering, defendants aver and charge that on the — day of-, 187-, the said plaintiff asked and obtained permission to build and lay a pavement on the south side of his said storehouse, on Main street, on the north side of said street, from the.southeast corner of said storehouse to the northwest corner of the same, and that he Avas allowed for building said pavement a credit on his taxes levied and collected by said town; and that from the time of the building of said pavement until recently, when said plaintiff unlawfully and in defiance and contempt of the authority andpoAver of defendants erected a fence or rack on the south side of the same, the public have used and enjoyed the same. Defendants charge that by the repeated acts of plaintiff, the said ground has been dedicated to the public, and that he has- no right to obstruct, them in the use and enjoyment of the same, or to prevent these defendants, or their employes, from laying a pavement thereon for use ancl convenience of the public. ojrulq]ier answering, defendants deny that the building of said pavement will in anywise prevent or hinder the plaintiff from passing into his said lot to reach his storehouse in a proper manner with vehicles, horses, &c. Plaintiff has been passing in said lot over said pavement so far as laid, and with an impunity of boldness that defies authority. “Further answering, defendants say that it has not been usual for them to lay and build crossings on pavements for the benefit of private individuals, and that they did not refuse to put in a crossing for said plaintiff as he alleges, as he never gave them the opportunity to either refuse or grant such privilege by making application for the same.” To the said answer plaintiff replied generally. Exhibits were filed with the bill and answer, and depositions were taken by both parties, which are sufficiently stated in the opinion, and therefore need not be set out in this statement. E.

       "  'case_summary': 'LACLEDE-CHRISTY CLAY PRODUCTS COMPANY v. CITY OF ST. LOUIS et al., Appellants. Division Two, December 10, 1912. 1. PUBLIC ROAD: Evidence Necessary to Establish Existence-In 1862, an order of the county court of St. Louis county attempted to establish a public road called Sulphur avenue. The order was void, but in 1866 a member of the plaintiff corporation signed a communication to the court recognizing the existence of a road there, and his testimony shows that in 1863 there was a road with good fences on either side.- In 1875 the plaintiff was one of forty-six petitioners asking the county court to-grade said road, which in 1876 was taken into the city of St. Louis; in 1882 said plaintiff acquired land bordering the highway by deeds which stated they were subject to“ it, and in 1889-the plaintiff, its charter expiring, made to itself as a new corporation a deed showing the existence of the highway. The-city, in 1889, replaced a bridge on said highway. Held, in this suit to enjoin the removal by the city of plaintiff’s structures, from the right of way, that the land in question was a public highway. 2. -: User for Ten Years. The use of a road for ten years with the acquiescence of the owner makes it a valid road. 3.-: Title Vesting in City. By virtue of Sec. 10, Art. 1, of the Scheme and Charter of St. Louis (1876), the interest of St. Louis county in all public roads and highways taken into the city was vested in said city. Semble, that independent of such provision such would be the result of taking a public road into-a city. 4. -: City Streets: Sec. 10446, R. S. 1909. Although in. this case it is not clear there was such nonuser, it is held that Sec. 10446, R. S. 1909, providing that “nonuser by the public for a period of ten years continuously of any public road shall be deemed an abandonment,” does not apply to city streets. 5. CITIES: Streets: Title not Lost by Abandonment or Adverse Possession. The right of a city and the public to the use of a. street cannot be lost by abandonment or adverse possession. 6. -: -: Title: Estoppel. A city is not estopped from asserting title in a street by the declaration of its street commissioner that the ground in question was not a street, nor by its ordinance condemning the right of way for the purpose of laying sewer and water pipes.

Walla Walla, 2 Pac. 187. Lyon & Swarts for respondent. (1) The action of the county court is a nullity— it can have no vitality for any purpose. Appellants are relying on the proceedings of the county court, and if the proceedings are a nullity there is nothing in law ■on which to rely. In re Essex Avenue, 121 Mo. 105; Seafield v.

(2) Mere proof of intermittent public travel over unoccupied land on different tracks, as suited convenience, and depending on the condition of the alleged road, is insufficient to establish a highway by riser.

W. 590; State v. ■Culver, 65 Mo. 609. (4) The public had not used the alleged road for a continuous period of about thirty years; no public money or labor was expended on the alleged road for the period of ten consecutive years, or at any time, either during the period of its alleged public use or since it was abandoned. E. S. 1899, Sec. 9472; State v. Meier, 136 Mo. App. 123; State v. Macy, 72 Mo. App. 432. (b) Sec. 9472, E. S. 1899, did apply to the city of St. Louis. It was first enacted in 1879 (E. S. 1879, Sec. 6987), and was amended in 1883, but not as to the matter here .relied on. Sec. 9446, E. \\'S. 1899, was first enacted in 1899, providing that the article did not apply to counties having a population ■of 100,000. The enactment of section 9446 in 1899 did not affect the legal status of the alleged road, which, under the law and the statutes in force at that time had been abandoned by the public.. (5) Estoppel is good only between the parties and those in privity with them. Where it applies, we find such elements as dedication of street or road, the platting of streets, sale of property bounded by streets or roads, the erection of improvements in reliance thereon. No such element is in this case. Cattle v. Snyder, 101 Mo. 763; Hempstead v. Easton, 31 Mo. 142; Schenck v. Stumpf, 6 Mo. App. 381; Curtis v. Browne, 63 Mo. App. 431.',\n",

Stat. §§ 6890-6893, 6897, which provide that, in every action in justice’s court where the title to land shall in any wise come in question, the defendant may give notice thereof under his plea of the general issue, and, upon filing the required bond, the justice shall certify the case to the circuit court for trial, and, if plaintiff recovers judgment, he shall recover double costs, and if defendant recovers judgment, other than that of nonsuit, and the presiding judge shall certify that the title to land did not come in question, the defendant shall not recover costs, but shall pay costs to the plaintiff. 2. Where, in an action of trespass in justice’s court, the declaration charges that the defendant, with force and arms, and contrary to the provisions of section 1, chap. 272, How. Stat., entitled “Trespasses on Lands,” did cut down and carry off, without and against the leave of the plaintiff, the owner and occupant in possession thereof, divers trees (describing them) then and there being and standing upon the land of the plaintiff (describing it), by means whereof plaintiff has lost and been deprived of said trees, and said lands and premises of the plaintiff have been greatly injured and depreciated in value, whereby the said defendant has, by force of said statute, forfeited three times the amount of damages sustained by the plaintiff, and the case is certified to the circuit court for trial upon a plea of title, and on the trial the real point in controversy is whether or not the plaintiff gave permission to the defendant to enter upon the land and cut the trees, which issue is found and a verdict rendered in favor of the defendant, the title to land does not come in question, and the court is justified in so certifying.

If a former default judgment adjudging plaintiff to he the owner of the land and forever enjoining defendants from asserting any title thereto is valid, it forever precludes defendants from introducing evidence of title in them at any time prior to its rendition. 2. ■ — ■-: Former Judgment Void Because of Insufficient Prayer: Sec. 2092, R. S. 1889, and Sec. 2100, R. S. 1909. If the only relief prayed for in the petition in the former action begun in 1908 was that “the defendants may be summoned to show cause why they should not bring an action to try their alleged claim or title thereto, if any they have,” the default judgment adjudging plaintiff to be the owner of the land and forever enjoining defendants from asserting title thereto was void, because the petition clearly shows the action was instituted under Sec. 2092, R. S. 1889, which was repealed by the Act of 1897, Laws 1897, p. 74, and because if the judgment granted other relief than that prayed for it would not be binding upon defaulting defendants, since it is expressly provided by Sec. 2100, R. S. 1909, that in such case the relief granted “shall not be other or greater than that which he [the plaintiff] shall have demanded in the petition.” Appeal from Butler Circuit Court. — Hon. J. G. Sheppard, Judge. Affirmed. Oliver & Oliver for appellant. (1) Where a court has jurisdiction over the subject-matter of a suit and of the parties, its judgment is binding on the parties until set aside or annulled by appeal. Such a judgment may be irregular and voidable, but it is not void and cannot be attacked collaterally. Chouteau v. Gibson, 76 Mo. 46; Murphy v. DeFrance, 101 Mo. 151; Hardin v. Lee, 51 Mo. 244; Reed Bros. v. Nicholson, 158 Mo. 631; State v. Wear, 145 Mo. 203; Black on Judgments, sec. 170. (2) This is true, although the defense sought to \\'be set up in the second suit was not set up in the first suit, provided such defense came within the scope of the inquiry of the first suit. Donnell v. Wright, 147 Mo. 647;. Railroad v. Traube, 59 Mo. 362; Tuttle v. Iiarritt, 85 N. C. 456; Hotel Assn. v. Parker, 58 Mo. 327; Hamilton v. McLean, 169 Mo. 51; Railroad v. Levy, 17 Mo. App. 507; Mc-Oalley v. Wilburn, 77 AJa. 549; 2 Black on Judgments, sec. 697; Freeman on Judgments (4 Ed.), sec. 36. (3) The issues tendered by plaintiff’s petition to quiet title in 1908 were: 1st, ownership in fee of the land described; 2nd, possession of the land described by plaintiff; 3rd, assertion that defendants set up some claim to the lands described, adverse to the plaintiff. These were the jurisdictional and issuable averments in the plaintiff’s petition. They conform to the requirements of the statute. To these charges no denial was interposed or made by either of the adult defendants. The minor defendant did deny them. The cause was submitted on the testimony offered by the plaintiff, and the court found all of the facts set up in plaintiff’s petition to be true. Judgment was entered, quieting the title in the plaintiff, and enjoining and prohibiting the defendants from further asserting claim or title to the lands. The defendants could have denied: (a) plaintiff’s ownership of the land; (b) plaintiff’s possession of the land; and: (c) averred ownership by adverse possession for ten years, if they had so elected; refusing to plead, they are estopped and barred from doing so in this case. Hamilton v. McLean, 169 Mo. 73, and authorities cited under point one. (4) In an action to quiet title, all matters affecting the title of the parties to the action may be litigated and determined, and the judgment therein is final and conclusive. A general finding of title in the plaintiff and consequently of no title in the defendant is a conclusive and binding decision against the defendant on the question of title from what-\" ever source it may be derived, and forever estops him from asserting a claim of title which existed at the time of the finding and the judgment. This is the very purpose of the statute. 2 Black on Judgment, sec. 664, p. 800; Sec. 650, R. S. 1899; Sec. 2535, R. S. 1909. (5) The petition in the suit to quiet title was in accord with the provisions of the statute, except the prayer. The circuit court of New Madrid County, however, disregarded so much of the prayer as was inappropriate and unauthorized under the averments of the petition and the law, and entered a decree quieting title in plaintiff. The court had the right to grant plaintiff any relief “consistent with the case made by the plaintiff and embraced within the issues.” The character of an action is determined by the facts stated in the petition and not by the prayer for relief. Sec. 76, R. S. 1899; Sec. 2100, R. S. 1909; Sec. 767, R. S. 1899; Sec. 2091, R. S. 1909; State ex rel. v. Land & Lumber Co., 161 Mo. 671; Sharkey v. McDermott, 91 Mo. 657; Reed v. Bott, 100 Mo. 67; Commings v. Railroad, 48 Mo. 517; Lumber Co. v. Jones, 220 Mo. 197. (6) The judgment of the circuit court of New Madrid County of September, 1908, adjudging that the plaintiff was_ the owner in fee of the land in suit, and further adjudging and decreeing that the defendants and each of them be forever enjoined, restrained and forbidden from asserting any right, title, claim or interest in and to the land, is just as binding as any other judgment affecting real estate. The statute specially provides that such a judgment “shall have the same force and effect as a judgment obtained under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure.” Sec. 651, R. S. 1899; Sec. 2536, R. S. 1909. I. R. Kelso and J. G. Miller for respondents. (1) A suit to quiet title does not contemplate a judgment for possession, and that a writ of ouster go, “The precise point has been ruled upon and is no longer open.” Mann v. Doerr, 222 Mo. 11. (2) The Act of 1897, concerning suits to quiet titles, by declaring that it is enacted for the purpose of “taking the place of statutes which fail in.their object,” expressly repeals Sec. 2092, R. S. 1889 (Sec. 647, R. S. 1899), since there is no other section to which it can refer. Merriweather v. Love, 167 Mo. 514. (3) We call attention to some of the cases decided by the courts of this State under Section 2092, above mentioned, and under which appellant attempted to institute suit to quiet title after this statute had been repealed, (a) In order to institute a proceeding under this section the petitioner must be in actual possession of the premises. Yon Phul v. Penn, 31 Mo. 333; Rutherford v. Ullman, 42 Mo. 216; McGrath v. Mitchell, 65 Mo. App. 626; Root v. Mead, 58 Mo. App. 477; Chaffin v. Clark, 33 Mo. App. 99; Thompson v. New-berry, 93 Mo. 18. (b) A proceeding instituted under this section is not for the purpose of settling the title to the premises in the first instance, but is only preliminary to an action which the defendant or adverse claimant may be ordered to bring for that purpose. See cases above cited; also Colline Assn. v. Johnson, 120 Mo. 299. (c) On. the trial of the issues formed on the petition, evidence showing title in fee in the plaintiff, is not proper ; it being only necessary for him to show actual possession of the premises, claiming either an estate of freehold, or an unexpired term of not less than ten years. Dyer v. Baumeister, 87 Mo. 134. (d) A possession by the plaintiff that is merely nominal, or wrongfully obtained for the purpose of instituting a\\'suit so as to require the defendant to bring a suit to assert his title, is not sufficient to justify an order against the defendant to institute a suit. See last case above cited, (e) This section was not intended to authorize a proceeding that would be a substitute for the action of ejectment.',\n",

Acts 1881, relating to obstructions and encroachments on highways and the removal thereof, does not abrogate the common-law remedy of abatement of nuisances by the mere act of individuals. 2. Same — Nuisance—Abatement. . An unauthorized obstruction across a public street is a public nuisance which any citizen desiring to travel along the street may abate. 3. Same — Abatement—Special Interest. If a special grievance on the part of an individual abating an obstruction in a highway be necessary, such grievance exists in the case of the highway commissioner by virtue of his office. 4. Same — Acceptance or User — Question eor Jury. Evidence of the acceptance of a highway by doing work thereon and of its use by the public considered, and held,t sufficiently in conflict to make the question one for the jury. 5. Same — Opening and Working. The fact that no part of a highway was opened and worked within four years after being laid out, as required by section 4063, 2 Comp. Laws, does not prevent the establishment of the highway by user under section 4061, but would merely require a user of ten years, instead of eight. 6. Same. It is not essential that every part of a highway should be worked, in order to show the intention of the public authorities to accept the entire highway. / 7. Trespass — Trial—Instructions. In trespass for removing fences from premises claimed by plaintiff, and alleged by defendant to be a highway, the court instructed that “on the part of plaintiff, * * * who has the burden of proof to show that a wrong has been committed against him, the issue becoming one as to whether this was a public and lawful way, the plaintiff claims that it was not, and that he had a right to inclose the strip of land.” In a subsequent part of the charge the jury were told that they must find for plaintiff, unless they found that the road was established as claimed by defendant. Held, that, taking the charge- as a whole, plaintiff could not complain that the burden was cast on him to show that the alleged highway was not a lawful road. Error to Tuscola; Beach, J.

Adverse Possession—Occupancy of Land—Sufficiency to Establish Prescriptive Title.—Evidence that a claimant of land visited it a short time, posted notices thereon claiming the same and warning trespassers, asserted ownership on one or two occasions when ho found sheep and cattle running on the premises, allowed a man one winter to camp on the place to hunt and trap, paid the taxes, but made no improvements, is not sufficient to establish title by adverse possession. Id.—Possession of Part of Tract Composed of Several Lots.—Where a tract of one hundred and sixty acres is divided into five lots, the inclosure of ten acres, the evidence not showing on which lot, will not sustain a judgment for title to the entire tract by adverse possession. Id.—Essentials of Adverse Possession—Hostile Claim-—Findings.— The adverse and hostile character of the possession is of the very essence of a prescriptive title. Therefore a finding that the defendant and his predecessors “have at all times held open, notorious, peaceable and exclusive possession of said lands under claim of right and title thereto,” and have paid the taxes during all such time, will not support a judgment for title by adverse possession. Id.—Suit to Quiet Title—Reimbursement for Taxes.—Where the defendant, in a suit to quiet title, raises the defense of adverse possession, but does not claim reimbursement from the plaintiff for taxes paid, and the complaint does not disclose such right to reimbursement, the maxim, “He who seeks equity must do equity,” cannot be invoked so as to require the plaintiff before having judgment, to reimburse the defendant. Id.—Appeal—Judgment on Findings—When not Allowable__-Where,* in a suit to quiet title, judgment is awarded the defendant on his plea of title by adverse possession, but on appeal it appears that the judgment is not supported by the findings, and there is no finding in favor of the plaintiff, the appellate court cannot order judgment for the plaintiff on the findings, but will reverse the judgment and remand the cause for a new trial.

Deed—Mistake in Description. —The fact that a deed describes the land conveyed as being the southeast quarter instead of the southwest quarter of a quarter-section named is not controlling. If the land really intended to be conveyed can be identified by monuments actually fixed upon the ground, then the mistake as to the subdivision in which it is situated may be rejected as falsa demonstrado. Id. — Ejectment — Nonsuit.—When both parties to an ejectment suit are in possession, claiming a part of the land conveyed by a mistaken description of the quarter-quarter-section, and the only question between them is as to where were its exact eastern and western boundaries, a motion for nonsuit because of the mistaken description in the conveyance is properly overruled. Ejectment—Evidence—Conte act of Sale — Equitable Title — Division Line. — The defendant in an action of ejectment is entitled to prove a contract of sale under which he entered into possession and erected improvements, whereby he became the equitable owner of the land, and as such dealt and agreed with the plaintiff’s grantor as to a division line. He is entitled to show by bis contract his relations to the land and to the adjacent owner. Coterminous Owners—Agreement as to Division Line—Statute op Limitations. — Where coterminous owners agree as to a division line between them, in which they acquiesce, and under which they occupy for a period equal to that fixed by the statute of limitations, the line thus established is binding upon them, and^those holding under them or either of them, without reference to the existence of any dispute as to the true line. Id. — Implied Agreement—Improvements — Acquiescence — Estoppel IN Pais. — If two coterminous owners trace their dividing line without any agreement more than is implied from their acts, and, both recognizing it as such, one goes forward, with the knowledge and acquiesence of the other, and makes such valuable improvements as to work great injury to the party making them if the line be disturbed, the other will be estopped from afterward alleging such mistake as shall deprive the owner of his improvements, especially if the party seeking to disturb the line knew, or had the means of knowing, at the time the improvements were made, all that he subsequently learned. Appeal from, the judgment of the Superior Court of Mendocino County, and from an order refusing a new trial. The facts are stated in the opinion. J. T. Rogers, for Appellant. J. A. Cooper, and T. L.

Evidence—weight of, left to trial court, it devolves on the court trying a case below without a jury, to scrutinize the testimony and determine its weight, and when this is done the judgment will not be disturbed on review, unless clearly against the evidence. 2. Adverse possession—to defeat party having legal title—what sufficient. Adverse possession, to defeat by limitation one having the title, must have been, in its inception and continuously for twenty years, hostile, adverse, 'visible and exclusive, and acquired and retained under claim of title inconsistent with that of the true owner; but such claim need not be rightful, nor supported by paper title. 3. Propositions of law—substantial accuracy sufficient. The holding of a proposition of law not technically accurate, but substantially so, will not reverse, where, from another proposition held upon the same subject, it appears the court was not mistaken as to the law which should govern the case. Writ of Error to the Circuit Court of Coles county ; the Hon. Francis M. Wright, Judge, presiding. Mr. J. W. Craig, and Mr. L. C. Henley, for the plaintiff in error: To constitute such possession as will bar the title of the true owner, five elements must concur : First, it must be hostile in its inception; second, it must be actual; third, it must be visible, notorious and exclusive ; fourth, it must be continuous; and fifth, it must be under claim of title for the full period of twenty years. Jackson v. Berner, 48 Ill. 203. All presumptions of law are in favor of the holder of the legal title to lands, and he will be considered as constructively in possession thereof unless they are proven to be in the actual, hostile occupancy of another, under a claim of title. Bliss v. Johnson, 94 N. Y. 235. The claim of an easement, a permissive possession, a tenancy, or the possession of a mere trespasser entering and holding without claim of title, is not adverse to the rightful owner, and cannot ripen into a title by lapse of time.

Plaintiff, purchasing the undivided half interest of S. in a lot, as shown by the record, has not constructive notice of an oral partition of the lot by S. and O., his co-tenant, from the fact that 0. had for years paid the taxes on a certain half of the lot. 3. Plaintiff, at the time she took a deed for the undivided half interest of S. in a lot, is not shown to have had actual notice of an oral partition by S. and O., his co-tenant, by the fact that she thereafter paid the taxes on the part S. had occupied, and when O. forbade her sweeping her dirt onto the part occupied by him, she said that O.’s deed was not fixed right, and that she could do what she felt like till there was a division. 4.

Tufts, Henry Fleckenstein, S. Julien Mayer, David Cole, D.

The complaint is in the usual form, averring: ‘ ‘That the said boundary line between the lands aforesaid is as follows, to wit: Commencing at a point in the east boundary line of the Amos N. King donation land claim, which point is the northwest corner ©f-the W. W. Chapman donation land claim, and also the southwest corner of the D. H.

King donation claim to a point which is 93 feet easterly, measured along the south boundary line of B street from a point where said B street is intersected by the west boundary line of Fourteenth street, as alleged by plaintiff, or that said line is the easterly boundary line of plaintiff’s lands or the westerly boundary line of the lands belonging to these defendants. These defendants, further answering, allege ‘ ‘that the true and correct east boundary line of the A. N. King donation land claim, as established by the proper officers of the United States to said King, commences at a point on the base line, which is three chains east of the southwest corner of the southwest quarter of section 33, township 1 north, of range 1 east of the Willamette meridian, and running thence north 20° 15' east 20.60 chains to a point near and intersecting the south line of B street, as now laid out and existing in. said city of Portland, county of Multnomah and State of Oregon; and that the southwest corner of the donation land claim of said D. H. Lownsdale and Nancy Lownsdale, as established by the officers of the government of the United States and patented to them, commences at a point on said line last described north 20° 15' east and 6.15 chains distant from the said commencement point of said King’s donation land claim; thence running north 20° 15' east 14.45 chains intersecting and near the south boundary of said B street, and distant in a westerly direction from thfe west line of Fourteenth street, as originally laid out, 77 feet, more or less, to the said east line of King’s donation land claim and the west boundary line of said Lownsdale donation land claim as herein set forth. And for a further answer, these defendants plead adverse possession for more than ten years. The reply denies the new matter set up in the answer, including the adverse possession of the defendants. The answer of the city of Portland, after denying and alleging substantially the same facts concerning the true boundary as in the answer of the other defendants, alleges that there is a public street through the lands of defendants Brigham and Tufts. The cause was referred to a referee to report the testimony and conclusions of fact and law; and on the coming-in of his report, the court below modified the same and found “that the eastern boundary line of the donation land claim of Amos N. King and the western boundary line of the donation land claim of Daniel H. and Nancy Lowns-dale, as originally run, is a line commencing at the stone monument at the northwest corner of the donation land claim of W. W. Chapman, which is also the southwest corner of the donation land claim of Daniel H. and Nancy Lownsdale; and thence running northerly on a line north -degrees east to a point in the south line of John H. Couch donation land claim, which is seventy (70) feet from the west line of Fourteenth street in the city of Portland, Oregon, sometimes called ‘Old Fourteenth street. ’ ” The court also found that by reason of adverse possession of the plaintiff Amos N. King, as found by the referee, he, said Amos N. King, is the owner in fee simple of all the lands described in the complaint which lie north of the south line of Morrison street, if extended westerly, and west of a line running north 20° 15' east from the stone monument at the northwest corner of the W. W. Chapman claim to the south line of the John H. Couch donation land claim, where there is an iron post set by C. W. Burrage. A decree was entered against the city of Portland, adjudging that Morrison street does not extend further west than the west line of Fourteenth street. A decree was then entered establishing the line between plaintiffs and defendants Cole, Cavanaugh, Soderstrand and Esser as one running from the stone monument at the southwest corner of the Lownsdale claim to a point in the south line of the Couch claim, which is 70 feet west of the west line of Old Fourteenth street, and between plaintiffs and defendants Brigham and Tufts as a line running from the stone monument at the northwest corner of the Chapman claim north SO3 15' east to the iron post set by C. W. Burrage in the south line of the Couch claim. From this decree, the defendants Brigham, Tufts and Cole appeal. The facts sufficiently appear in the opinion. B. & E. B. Williams and G. H.

      "Griffin's Appeal. 1. Where there is no dedication of land to public use by the owner, use of the same by the public jointly with the owner and by his sufferance, does not establish a right in the public by dedication, no matter how long such joint use is continued. Dedication is a matter of intention, ana when clearly proved, is as complete in one day as in twenty-one years. 2. In absence of opposing proof, long continued use by the public is evidence of an intent to dedicate, but it is not conclusive, and always yields to satisfactory contrary proof. 3. Where the owner of land, bordering on a public highway, sets his fence back from the highway for his own convenience, and uses the intervening space until his death, for private purposes, a bill for an injunction will not lie, by the municipal authorities, to restrain a subse quent owner of said property, fifteen years after the death of the former owner, from setting back the fence, and again including said intervening space within the same. 4. The testimony in this case held to warrant a finding of the above state of facts. 6. Semble. That in eases where the court below reversos a Master upon findings of fact, without reviewing the testimony, an opinion should be filed pointing out the errors of the Master in his treatment of the facts. February 26th, 1885. Before Mercur, C. J., Gordon, Paxson, Trunkey, Sterrett, Green and Clark, JJ. Appeal from the Court of Common Pleas of Lackawanna county: In Equity: Of January Term 1885, No. 287. Bill in equity, filed August 2d, 1875, between the city of Scranton, plaintiff, and D. W. Griffin, defendant, praying for an injunction to restrain the defendant from erecting a fence along the side of Main street, claimed by plaintiff to extend into, and be an obstruction to said street. The bill set out, that in the city of Scranton there was a street known as Main street which had been accepted and used as a public street or road for thirty years or more; that the fence on the easterly side had remained unchanged for a period of thirty years; that the defendant had begun the erection of a fence in front of his premises and along the line of said Main street, 15 feet in front of the former fence line, toward the centre of Main street, occupying the sidewalk and reducing the width of the street; by reason of which the street was made unsafe for travel, and the city rendered liable to suits for damages. The defendant’s answer denied that the fence at the point in dispute had been fixed and permanent as alleged in the bill; and averred that it had been frequently changed; that Judson Clark, a former owner, had thrown back the fence at said point which was in front of his dwelling, so as to make an unoccupied space there between the street and his house, where he could tie horses and leave wagons when not in use ; that the space so thrown open had not been dedicated to public use, and was the space now fenced in by the present owner of the Clark homestead, and finally that the defendant was not obstructing the street, but was building his fence upon the line established by the city authorities of Scranton. The cause was referred to M. J. Wilson, Esquire, as Master, who filed the following report: “In 1855 or 1856 Judson Clark became the owner of a farm, now in whole or in part within the limits of the city of Scranton. The Providence and Carbondale Plank Hoad passed over or across this farm. Soon after Mr. Clark purchased, he moved the road fence back on the side next his house, leaving an open space between the fence and the road bed, some twenty-five or thirty feet in width. This was done for the more convenient use of his property, to provide standing room for wagons, etc. This space was so used by Mr. Clark up to the time of his death in 1860. Mr. Clark left a will giving to his widow the dwelling house on the east side of the Providence and Carbondale Turnpike, with certain land on which it stood, bounded on the west by said 'road, and this is the property now owned b]r D. W. Griffin, the defendant. The defendant now seeks to take in all or a part of the land thrown out by Clark when he moved the road fence back, and by this bill the plaintiff seeks to restrain him from so doing. That part of the road is now in the First ward, and is known as Main street. It was graded and ditched, and sidewalks laid out in 1875 and 1876 by city officials and at city expense. I cannot find that Clark dedicated this strip of land to public use, or that he intended to do so; but from his acts I infer a contrary intent. Neither can I find that the fence erected or sought to be erected by the defendant is or will be an obstruction of this street. I am of opinion the defendant Iras the right to build his fence on the line where it used to be, where it was when Mr. Clark bought the farm, and I cannot say but that the fence being built is on or within that line. I would, therefore, advise that the injunction be dissolved and the bill be dismissed at the plaintiff’s cost.” The case was subsequently referred again to the Master to take further testimon}’. Numerous witnesses for the plaintiff testified that they had been familiar with the Clark property for thirty or forty years, and that they had never seen a fence in front of it “so far out in the street ” as the one started by the defendant; that there had been “no fence so far out for forty years” to their recollection; that said fence was in the road bed; that it was an obstruction to the road; that it “ stands in what was the road, and what has been the road for thirty years, so far as my recollection goes.”.....Witnesses for the defendant testified that Clark moved the fence back when he bought the property, and used the space thus made by the new fence for wagons, as previously reported by the Master. [The testimony of defendant’s witnesses is set out at length in the opinion of the Supreme Court.] The Master filed a second report by which he refused to change the former one, and recommended that the plaintiff’s bill be dismissed. The plaintiff filed, inter alia, the following exception:— “Fourth. Because the Master erred in deciding that a twenty-one year user on the part of the public, was not an absolute dedication to public use, rendering the erection of any obstruction thereto, ground for the granting of an injunction.” The court, Handley, P. J., filed the following opinion: “We filed an opinion on December 29th, 1875, continuing the injunction granted in this case. The Master now reports adversely to the plaintiff, whereupon she filed exceptions. “We have made a careful examination of the evidence, the report and exceptions. We cannot agree with the Master, and hence sustain the plaintiff’s fourth exception, and order and direct the injunction heretofore granted to be made perpetual against the defendant.” The defendant thereupon took this appeal, assigning for error, the decree of the court making the injunction perpetual, and imposing the costs on the defendant. H. M. Hannah, for appellant. The Master finds that there was no dedication at all of the strip of land between the foot path used by the public along the defendant’s fence and the real road bed, which was some twenty-five or thirty feet from this fence. He finds as a matter of fact that “ Judson Clark moved his fences back on the side next his house, leaving an open space between the fence and the road bed some twenty-five or thirty feet in width. This was done for the more convenient use of his property, to provide standing room for his wagons, etc. This space was so used by Mr. Clark up to the time of his death in 1860.” There was no evidence offered by the plaintiff which directly contradicted this. The Master then only finds as a fact what the witnesses had positively sworn to. What he found upon this point was not only supported by the weight of the testimony, but was supported by all the direct testimony in the case relating to this particular question. The weight to be given to a Master’s finding of facts is fully explained’in Sproull’s App., 71 Pa. St., 137; Hindman’s App., 85 Id., 467; Burton’s App., 93 Id., 214; Wiutou v. Mott, 4 Luz. Leg. Reg., 71. I. H. Burns and E. B. Sturges, for appellee. In view of the testimony before the Master, the burden of proof was on the defendant below to overthrow the presumption of dedication. But the Master put the whole burden of showing a dedication on the plaintiff, in which plaintiff undoubtedly succeeded. “ It is not necessary to a dedication, that there shall have been twenty-one years of adverse enjoyment: ” Schenley ¶. Commonwealth, 36 Pa. St., 59. May 4th, 1885.\n",
