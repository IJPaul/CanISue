Building a fence entirely on his own land does not authorize the owner to remove any portion of a line fence, that had been previously erected. After some unsuccessful efforts to adjust the dispute, the defendant erected a fence on his land for the entire line and a few feet from it. In making this fence he used what he called his part of the original fence, and its removal left a gap into Thompson’s field at the turnpike. There was evidence for the plaintiff by Dunn and others that there had been an agreement between Thompson and defendant fixing what part of the fence each was to make; also that the original fence had been some feet over on Thompson’s land, with other evidence in support of his'case. After plaintiff came to Thompson’s farm, he refused to repair the other part of the fence, and in consequence cattle, &c., got into plaintiff’s fields; defendant then took half of all the line fence which he had built, because he thought he had the right to do so. He then built the fence from the canal up to the turnpike on his own land and set it all on his own side; this left a gap at the turnpike. I upset the fence that was on me; never threw anything down on Thompson’s land; sawed down on my land.” Levi Myers testified for defendant: “ Smith asked me to go to Johnson’s. In no aspect did more than half this fence belong to Smith, and this, too, an undivided half, so that every rail that Smith removed belonged to the extent of one-half thereof to Thompson, and their removal was an undoubted trespass.\",\n",

I built this fence to keep the chickens out of the garden, and had a gate made in this fence so I could get into the garden. The house I was occupying was not large enough for myself and wife and her family, and I built the house in which I now reside upon the spot I had used before then for a garden, and moved into it and have resided there since. I rented the old house to Mrs. Pickett and boarded with her during the time she remained. She remained about six months and then I rented the old house to Parson Beverly. This house has rented at from $12.50 to $16.50 per month. During the time Walters occupied the house he put up a board fence from near the northwest corner of the house to the back part of the lot, and built a cow shed in the horse lot, but no fence was extended south till after Mr. Lyons went into the old house. This cistern was built by me when I built the old house, and have used drinking water out of it all the time since I moved into the house where I now reside except when it was dry last summer; and in getting water I pass through the gate in the fence between my residence and the old house. The first house on the west side, as shown on the plat, is my residence, and the dotted line east of this is the old garden fence and is so marked, and the cross-mark in the line is the gate leading to the old house, and through this I pass to get my drinking water from the cistern. The next house east on this plat is intended to represent the old house. The house east of this is intended to represent the Walters house, and the dotted line the fence between the old house and the Walters house. I have no occupation and my only means of support is the rent from the old house and the Walters house. I built the Walters house a purpose to rent out. This fence was built by S. C. Walters while he lived in the east house, out of piano boxes. I then go across to the back portion of that portion of the lot on which he resides, and that is the only way by which you can reach that portion of the lot which is in the rear of the house in which he lives.” Cross-examined. We have resided exclusively in the house where we now do for about nine years, and have at no time resided in either of the other houses since 1878, when I rented to Mr. Lyon. The old house has five rooms in it and a smoke house and privy in back yard; I have rented this house out ever since I built my residence, but took my meals there a part of the time as stated. “At the time I built my residence and Walters house I was not in debt; that part of the block owned by me at the time I first built upon it was worth about $600, and is now worth with all three houses about $3000.',\n",

Where the objection to a recovery in such action, was, that it did not appear, that there was no record of a division of the fence; it was held, that the objection was unavailing. The third plea averred, that the fence described in the declaration as being about thirty-two and a half rods long, and as having been divided by said fence-viewers, was made by the plaintiff, without the defendant’s knowledge or consent, and against his will, on the land, which, at the time it was so built, and until long after said pretended division by said fence-viewers, was, and continued to be, owned and occupied by the defendant; and said fence was, at the time of such pretended division, owned by the defendant, and so was not subject to such division and award by said fence-viewers, at the request of the plaintiff. for more than fourteen years, before said division and award, and long before any claim or demand for a division of said fence was made by the plaintiff of the defendant, or was proved or pretended to have been so made before said fence-viewers. To the third plea he replied, that the division fence, described in said plea, was built, by those under whom the plaintiff claims, upon the boundary line, between the lands owned by those under whom the plaintiff claims, and those under whom the defendant claims, and with the knowledge and consent of the defendant, and those under whom he claims; and that it has ever since continued to be, and still is, upon said boundary line; traversing the allegation that said fence was made by the plaintiff, without the defendant’s knowledge and consent, and against his will, on land, which, at the time it was so built, and until long after the division of said fence, by said fence-viewers, was, and continued to be, owned and occupied by the defendant. That the inability to agree upon a division of the fence, is sufficiently stated; the declaration following the language of the statute. In this case, there is no duty on the part of the plaintiff to maintain the division fence between him and the defendant, arising out of prescription; because first, the duty to make and maintain a division fence is thrown equally upon the adjacent owners by statute, and a statutory obligation cannot be waived or dispensed with by prescription.',\n",

Case by Thomas Anthony against Nelson Krum and Franklin Peters to recover damages for the loss of a horse, occasioned by the alleged negligence of the defendants in not making and keeping in repair a fence between tire lands of the plaintiff and the defendants, through which neglect the plaintiff’s horse had strayed into the defendants’ field and fallen into a stone quarry and was killed. There were two open quarries in this field on the plaintiff’s tract that were unfenced and no fence between that held and the defendant’s quarry. During the night this horse, while pasturing in this unfenced field, strayed on the premises of the defendants and fell into the quarry and was killed. It was contended by the defendants that they were not obliged to fence in their quarry or to keep up the fence already there, and that they were not bound by the parol personal contract between Kern and Williams; and that if they were bound by this understanding they were not liable in this action, because the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence. If the plaintiff knew that the fence was no longer there, or was bad, and he put his horse in the field, and the horse strayed over and fell into the pit, he would be guilty of contributory negligence and could not recover. According to my view of the law, if the defendants were bound to keep up the fence and did not keep it up, I say to you if the defendants are found by you to have been liable to make that fence, and they failed to make it, and the plaintiff put his horse into the field, and the horse came over through that fence or where it should have been, the defendants may be held liable. • If the plaintiff has convinced you that such was the understanding and contract between the owners of the land .at one time, and that that was never changed, then the duty fell upon the owners of the Harry Williams tract to maintain the fence at the northern end.

The parties hereto, about October 1, 1904, made an oral agreement whereby the defendant, in consideration of securing a half interest in a fence owned by the plaintiff, stipulated to convey to the latter, a tract of land 20 rods east and west, and 8 rods north and south, from the southwest corner of such lot, and to execute to him a deed therefor when the premises should be released from the lien of a mortgage.

Soon after Mr. Clark purchased, he moved the road fence back on the side next his house, leaving an open space between the fence and the road bed, some twenty-five or thirty feet in width.

Wayne railroad, there was a driveway immediately adjoining it on the side of the railroad, leading from the Seminary lane back to the stable, and that driveway was fenced on both sides, both on the side next to the property that was sold to Mrs. Craig and on the line of the alley or driveway next to the railroad. The question in dispute is the location of the fence on the side of that alley farthest from the railroad and next to the line of the Craig lot. The plaintiff alleges, and has offered evidence to substantiate the fact, that the new fence erected in 1885 was on the side of the alley farthest from the railroad and next to the line of the lot of Mrs. Craig. If that be true, then it is admitted that the present fence erected by the defendants is eighteen feet over on the land of the plaintiff, Mrs. Long, assuming that her line ran to the alleyway. The defendants allege that the new fence that was erected was built on the line of the fence on the side of the alley next to the railroad, or farthest from the Craig lot. If that be true, if I remember the figures accurately, then the present fence built there in 1898, is substantially on the line of the old fence which separated the alleyway from Mrs. Craig’s lot. If you find that the fence erected there in 1885 was on the line of the alley which separated the Craig lot from at that time the Dickinson lot, as they were fenced in (I do not mean now with reference to the courses and distances marked in the deed, but as they were there on the ground, unfenced), then your verdict should be for the plaintiff, provided that you are satisfied' that the land was bought, as I have before explained to you, by the monuments as they existed on the ground. The title in that case to this strip of ground would be in the plaintiff in this suit, and the breaking down of the other fence and the entry on that ground and erecting a fence across it would be a trespass.\",\n",

At that time the statute gave a lien to a mechanic if the work was done for any person who had contracted with the owner of the land for its purchase.

       "  'case_summary': \" Cattle — • Trespass— Party fence — Question for jury. The owner of cattle kept upon a farm is bound to keep them from tres^ passing on his neighbor’s land, but where a parly fence enters into consideration, while the duty is imposed on the owner of cattle to make it sufficient to restrain a tendency to roam, yet the matter of sufficiency of such a fence is a question for the jury. It appears from the record and evidence that this action arose over two acts of alleged trespass by defendant’s cows. Defendant appealed. Errors assigned were (1) refusing defendant’s point, which point and answer thereto are as follows : “If the jury believe the evidence on the part of the defendant, that he had a good and sufficient fence to fence his cattle in, and he was not guilty of negligence, then the verdict must be for the defendant. It is not a question as to whether there was negligence on the part of the owner of the cattle in trusting them to those boys or not; if they did escape from their control, got upon this plaintiff’s land and destroyed her corn, the defendant is liable for whatever damages she sustained.” (3) In charging the jury as follows: “ It has been contended on the part of the defense that all that is required now of the owner of cattle, upon whom the duty is cast of fencing them in, is that he maintain a sufficient fence. This would address itself to your understanding of what would be right under circumstances such as these, because the owner of cattle has it within his power to keep them up. If the cattle are vicious and breachy, he knows it, is bound to know it, and having that knowledge he should provide such fence as is necessary to keep in the kind of cattle he owns, the kind of cattle he undertakes to keep. If they are not vicious, but ordinary cattle, and it turned out that they escape, then it would follow, of course, that the fence was not sufficient, even for the ordinary purpose of keeping in domestic animals. But in any event he is bound to keep them up so they may not trespass upon his neighbor’s land. It is not a question, in my judgment, whether his fence be what the jury might regard as a sufficient fence, or not; but I say to you he is absolutely bound to keep them within his own close, upon his own premises.” (4) In charging the jury as follows : “Now you will take this case and return such a verdict as you think will do justice between these parties. There is no evidence in the case showing that the defendant was guilty of negligence either in not providing a “ sufficient'” fence to keep his cattle in, or in intrusting them in the care of boys to drive to pasture; while on the other hand the evidence on the part of the defendant clearly proved that the fence was “ sufficient.” The court below took both of these questions practically from the jury.\",\n",

The present fence is now one hundred and seventy-three feet and six inches from Water street. In making my survey I began at the southeast corner of Miss Watkins’ lot. Could not say if Andreu said the fence was moved in from Orange street before or after the sale by him to Miss Watkins. That he had lately made a survey and'measurements of the blocks lying between Water and Orange streets, and found the distance between these streets measured along Mulberry street to be 302 feet; that Orange and Water streets are each thirty feet wide at Mulberry .street; and Miss Watkins’ fence on Water street is on a line with the other fences on that street. That the fence of the Benet lot on Orange street is on a line with the other fences on that side of the street. If the fence on west end of Benet’s lot was moved five feet to the west, it would reduce the width of Orange street to twenty-five feet. Miss Abbott testifies that from Water street to Orange street is 300 feet and that Andreu built his fence five feet into Orange street. While it does not appear that the line was run at the time of the conveyance, yet the plaintiff testified that at that time the dividing line was marked by a fence. The fourth charge given at the request of the plaintiff assigned as error, is as follows : “If you find from the evidence that the dividing line referred to in the deed from the defendants to the plaintiff was marked by a fence and it was so understood by the parties at that time, the plaintiff is entitled to the full amount of land called for by her deed, measured from such line.\",\n",

       "  'case_summary': ' In such a case it is immaterial that plaintiff may have occasionally used a private road, a part of which was on the land in dispute; and in such a case the deeds in the line of title may be sent out with the jury. The plaintiffs further show that these heirs of Robert Campbell, by a deed dated in 1884, conveyed to.Henry Myers 28 acres of this land. It seems to have been divided by one line running east and west, near the center, and cutting off 57 acres to the south. This Patton portion contained 28 acres. These children are all of age, and there are no deceased children, so that the eight children of Thomas Patton now own his interest, and are the plaintiffs in this case. It seems that this land was divided, and if you will recollect the testimony, and the descriptions in the deeds, it appears that the upper half was divided from the lower half by a line running on a bearing of north 87 degrees west, and it was parallel to the south line of this whole tract of 109 acres. I think you can safely start out in saying that at one time that was a straight line running from the western boundary of the Campbell farm to the eastern boundary. Now when the deed was made, which is the first deed for the part taken from this Campbell tract, to Mrs. Eussell, the line began and ran on a straight, line from the river to this western boundary. Later on this property was cut off by a deed from the Campbell heirs to Myers, and the bearing of this line on the Patton property, as I have stated, was north 87 degrees west, and it carries the same bearing as appears in the northern line of the Hooks property, so that this line was a straight line at one time, and was common to both properties.] This is the piece of property that is in dispute in this case.] So his line projected through the point, and this comes to a stone which we have heard a good deal of talk about, as the U. S. stone on the river bank. You can readily understand that the more deflection there would be from the line this way the greater amount of property there would be taken off the Hooks farm here, it would also...... the line on the Eebold. If you disregard that stone, and start from here, and run from the middle stone to the U. S. stone, and project this line back, you not only make a crook in the line, but you take away from Heboid a portion of that property and you give to the Pattons all of the land north of that line, or some 28 or 30 feet down at the river. Even if you find the line to be as claimed by the plaintiffs, they could then not recover possession, nor be entitled to your verdict, unless you find against this second theory of the defendant. If you refuse to adopt this theory as to the boundary line, which would give him the land in dispute, he still claims under the statute of limitations.] In this essential his claim of title by statute was wanting.',\n",

Polk, who extended West Street as at first dedicated or laid ont by him and accepted by the town, and then sold lots — at least two— on the extended portion of the street. There was a street in front of my house when I bought it, twenty-five or thirty years ago. The street was opened at that time 75 or 100 yards below my house. The fence constructed by Dr. Smith ran straight across the space opened up for the street, and then ran down the space with my line for some distance and across this space again. There was a clear space, 40 or 50 feet wide, opened along my eastern line to the Austin line, now the Beaehum line. All of this property was owned by L. L. Polk when I bought the Sturdivant lot and when the Sturdivant lot was bought from me, and also the second lot that I bought from L. L. Polk. Large trees had been cut out and this space opened up for a street, and has now grown up in bushes.

       "  'case_summary': \" the purpose of getting a road through to the Kenosha road. I sent the deed to my agent Perkins, requesting him to see Bushnell and Scott, as I was favorably disposed that Scott should have a road.” The defendant’s evidence tended to show that it was in April, 1861, and before the bridge was built, that plaintiff built said fence from the river to the railroad, and consented to defendant’s opening the road. about to build a bridge, if be could get an outlet to the Keno-sha road ; that he received a reply about the last of March or first of April of the same year, which he had lost; that the substance of the reply was, that Richards would not sell the land, but defendant could have the use of it for a road; that defendant showed the letter to plaintiff, who thereupon agreed to build and did build the fence from the 'bridge to the railroad, and consented to his using the road as above stated. “ If the defendant and the public were in possession of the premises, claiming them adversely to the plaintiff and his grantor as a road, at the time plaintiff obtained his deed from Richards, the deed was void to that extent, and conferred upon plaintiff no right to close up the road.” 2. “ If defendant was induced to build the bridge or make the road in consequence of the acts and conduct of the plaintiff and his grantor, then plaintiff was estopped from setting up a right to obstruct the road.” The following instructions were given: “ 1. If Richards promised defendant the road for public use in consideration that defendant would bridge the river and build the road; and defendant did so; and -the road was opened and used by the public as a highway, for a considerable time; these facts would go far to prove a dedication by Richards. The fact that the road was opened and in public use as a highway, when plaintiff received a conveyance of the premises, is constructive notice to the plaintiff of the rights of the public thereto, whatever those rights may be, and he is in the position that Richards would be in, had be retained the title to the land. The deed from Richards to plaintiff of land in the possession either of the public as a public highway, or of the defendant 'as a private road, was so far void. If plaintiff could recover in any action, it was ejectment and not trespass; defendant or the public being in the actual possession of tbe land.\",\n",

Title to land purchased by a railroad company for railroad purposes, adjoining its right of wa3q but not actuary occupied by its tracks, may be acquired by twenty-one years’ adverse possession; and it is immaterial that the company may have intended to lay tracks on such land, if in fact such intention was never carried into practical effect. The plaintiff contends that even if defendant’s adverse possession had been such as to give defendant title against the ordinary individual, it is nevertheless unavailing against a railroad corporation, as to land acquired by it for its railroad. It is correct to say, as an abstract proposition of law, that when land is acquired by a railroad corporation, either by purchase- or by condemnation, and is actually used for its railroad, no title can be gained to any portion of what is thus used, by adverse possession, however long it may be continued. That is the sum total of the evidence on that proposition, and I say to you as a matter of law the railroad has not established its immunity from adverse possession under the legal principle which it invokes. — A railroad is a public highway, and the land which it covers whether acquired by the exercise of eminent domain or by purchase is not the subject of adverse possession, and is immune from the statute: Reading Co. v. Seip, 30 Pa. Superior Ct. 330. When a railroad company condemns land it is of necessity the judge of how much is required for its use. — The act of the railroad company in fencing this land out of its right of way is conclusive upon the company.',\n",

Said land bounds plaintiff’s land on the east division line separating said lot. About the month of February, 1907, plaintiff desired to erect a fence on the dividing line separating her land from the land of Columbus Graham; the division line was uncertain, indefinite, and unknown, and before erecting the fence plaintiff approached Columbus Graham, with reference to agreeing upon the 'dividing line between plaintiff’s land and Graham’s land, that is between lots 38 and 39, and Graham suggested that Hon. Columbus Graham never repudiated the line during his lifetime, but omthe contrary recognized it as being the dividing line between his land and plaintiff’s land until the time of his death. The fence which was built upon the dividing line is now the true line, it having been built on said line for a period of more than seven years; the adjoining-land owners have acquiesced for a period of more than seven years, and the same is established as a matter of law as the dividing line. Henderson purchased these distributive shares while he was administrator (and he is still administrator) of the estate, for a sum considerably less than the bid that was made by Harris, and is now claiming to own in his individual capacity the land in lot 38 by reason of the purchase made from the distributees of the estate. Henderson as an individual is not the legal owner in fee simple of the land, but he is holding it in trust for the estate of Graham, deceased; and each heir at law of Graham has an interest in the title to the land, for the reason that Henderson is forbidden both by law and equity from purchasing the land from the distributees while he is acting in the capacity of administrator of the estate of Columbus Graham. Henderson has cut plaintiff’s wire fence and is entering upon her land, and has driven, or threatens to drive, away by force or otherwise, plaintiff’s hands from plowing the lands, and has staked off about ten acres, more or less, of plaintiff’s land, and is preparing to enclose it by removing plaintiff’s wire fence to the place so staked off by him. Henderson has no right or authority to enter upon the land or to interfere with plaintiff’s possession, and he has been requested to desist from so doing; but he refuses, and threatens and is actually proceeding to make preparations to take forcible possession of plaintiff’s land. If Henderson, either as an individual or as administrator, is permitted to destroy and tear 'down plaintiff’s fence and remove it from the established line on which it was erected, and to drive away plaintiff’s hands by force, and is permitted to take possession of plaintiff’s land, she will be irreparably damaged, and it will be necessary for her to bring an action at law to eject Henderson individually or as administrator, or probably the heirs at law of Columbus Graham, deceased; and thereby a multiplicity and circuity of suits will be necessary.

Division lines on the island, where this close was, were generally marked by a ditch and bank, and there were four modes of adjusting these : 1. There were two ditches with a bank between, in which case the mathematical line was along the middle of the bank. A ditch on one tract, a bank on' the other, straight throughout the line, in which case the margin of the ditch, next the bank, was on the exact line. A ditch was dug so that, for half the line, the southern margin was the exact line, the bank being on the south; then an offset was made in the ditch so as to make the northern margin a prolongation of the line, and the bank was thrown on the north. A ditch was dug straight the whole way, so that the line was in its middle, and the bank was thrown, for half way, on one side, and for the other half on the other. And in relation to him and to the motion for non-suit, it was further held that, however the defendants might have had a right to re-open the ditch, it was a trespass in either of them, if, by his directions, any dirt had been thrown on the plaintiff’s side of the ditch, or if he had unnecessarily stepped upon the plaintiff’s land. The verdict was for the plaintiff, against both defendants, $3000. This was shewn to be a pure misap prehension of the law. This is at the foundation of this case.

The defendant produced a grant of the marsh, dated and it was in evidence, that the plaintiff, since the date of the defendant’s grant, had obtained a grant of part of the marsh claimed under Stobo’s conveyance. The defendant’s witness positively swore that Mr. Heyward, the father, had never enclosed the marsh till within a recent date, but that it had been used indiscriminately as a common, so much at least as was fit for that purpose, by the cattle of the neighborhood; that the fence which enclosed Mr. Heyward’s field did not run into the marsh, but parallel with it, in proof whereof, trees of considerable growth (a fact not denied) between where the fence was said to have stood and the marsh, are now to be seen, which plainly delineates the course of the fence.

The defendant appealed to the Rensselaer common pleas, where the cause was again tried. The plaintiff produced a record of the road, containing a particular description of the place of beginning, the courses and distances, stating its extent across the lands of the defendant to be 19 chains and 74 links, and its contents to be 3 roods and 38 perches of land. The road was laid out by commissioners on the oath of twelve freeholders declaring it to be proper. The encroachment by means of the fences was proved as above stated ; they are worm rail fences, the centres of which are placed on the exterior line of the two rods, angling alternately on the land of the defendant and on the road, having stakes at each angle. The defendant further proved that 1 he fences were built as nearly on the exterior line of the two rods as possible, and that one of the commissioners of highways who laid out the road directed the fences to be built on the line; this direction was given to a son of the defendant, when the other commissioners and the plaintiff were present, but whether the plaintiff heard the directions, the witness could not say : this testimony was also objected to, but received. The evidence of the surveyor was properly received; it did not contradict or vary the record, but was entirely consistent with it, and therefore admissible. All the testimony in the case, however, shews that the road was to be two rods wide. The evidence of the direction given by the commissioners of highways as to the placing of the fence, and of the principles on which the appraisers assessed the damages, was illegal, and ought not to have been received, because it was not shewn that the plaintiff was privy to those transactions. The evidence of the declarations of the commissioners was therefore proper; and the testimony of Che appraisers was also correctly received, as it furnished evidence of the assent of the plaintiff to the building of the fences in the manner in which they were erected. The notice to remove the fences given in October was not obligatory upon the defendant; a notice to remove fences should state specially the extent of the encroachment. The plaintiff’s action is vexatious; when he recovered before the justice, he obtained judgment for but six cents damages, and if any error has occurred on the trial, it is sub- mi tied whether the judgment beloxv ought to' be reversed.

The defence alleged a parol gift from George Sower to Weaver and his wife, and gave evidence thereof, as follows:— Elizabeth Weaver, the daughter of George Sower, testified: “If I live till the 25th of February I will be sixty-one years old; I live with my husband on the land in dispute; I married Henry Weaver thirty-four years ago; father said he would divide the farm where John lived on, and build a house if we would go on; I told him I did not want to go there, I could not be at home, and he told me he would build a house on it, and if I was there once and had my stuff there I would be at home; I told him the land was too poor, we could not live on it; he said I could make it good; we went on the land; there was no house on the land at the time he gave me the land; my father helped to build the house; he got the carpenter work of the house done; Weaver, my husband, got the other part of the work done; he dug the cellar and had all the mason work done which was done to the house; we moved in on Whit-Monday of 1846 ; Weaver put up the barn in 1846; we have been living there ever since; when we went there the land was as poor as could be. building his house; I said to Sower, ‘You are going to build there1;’ he said, ‘Yes, I have divided my land now; I have given the old stand to John now, and the other part to Henry Weaver, and they shall build on it, and then it shall be theirs, and then they have their own;’ then he said, ‘they will not have to pay any rent any more.’ ” James Marshall testified: “ I had a conversation with George Sower; I asked Sower if the property was Henry Weaver’s or not; he said he gave his daughter Elizabeth, Weaver’s wife, the piece of land, and to his children, and he had nothing to do with it.” David Myers testified: “I was the assessor in 1846; Jacob Kochenour and George Sower were the assistant assessors that year; we assessed the farm; Sower was present; we assessed it in Weaver’s name; ‘This,’ he said, ‘assess to Weaver-; I gave it to Betz;’ I was the assessor after that, but cannot tell the years; may be fifteen years after that; Henry Weaver paid me the road tax.” Other testimony on this subject tended to corroborate the gift. George Sower was examined a second time on a rule to take testimony. He swore positively that he did not hear the conversation testified to by Elizabeth Weaver, about the giving of the land to her and her husband. To the various questions asked, he answered, “Not a word of it is true,” as “nothing of the kind was said.” He also denied that he had the conversations with the parties who testified as above. This parol gift of lands, accompanied as it was by possession and followed by valuable inprovements, is valid: Syler v. Eckhart, 1 Binn.',\n",

But in the case of lights, there is no adverse user; nor, indeed, any use whatever of another’s property; and no foundation is laid for underlying any presumption against the rightful owner. When one builds upon his own land, immediately adjoining the land of another person, and puts out windows overlooking that neighbor’s land, he does no more than exercise a legal right. By the exercise of a legal right he can make no encroachment upon the rights of his neighbor, and cannot thereby impose any servitude or acquire any easement by the exercise of such a right for any length of time. It must be either an invasion of his vested rights, or else consequently injurious to their free exercise. By the common law, a prescriptive right to prevent the adjacent proprietor from inclosing or building upon his own land cannot be acquired by the use of an adjoining house, having windows looking out upon his land and receiving light and air from that direction, for a period of ten years. The effect of the judge’s charge was, that ten years’ unobstructed\" use of the windows gave the prescriptive right to look out upon her neighbor’s land; and that for. the adjoining proprietor to obstruct her light, by building on his own land, was a trespass; that is, if he had acquiesced in her right for ten years. It must be either a direct invasion of his vested rights, or else consequently injurious to their free exercise. “In order that the enjoyment of an easement in another’s land may be conclusive of the right, it must have been adverse, that is, under a claim of title, with the knowledge and acquiescence of the owner of the land, and uninterrupted; and the burden of proving this is on the party claiming the easement. Has the enjoyment of the windows been adverse, under a claim or assertion of right, as some of the authorities require? The doctrine declared in the decision upon which appellant seems to rely, (13 Shepl., 436,) viz, that a person, by the exercise of a lawful right, cannot be guilty of an encroachment upon others’ rights, cannot be sound.',\n",

       "  'case_summary': \" This case was tried before the court without a jury, and the following finding of facts and law made: “ In 1859 Wright Buzzard owned 80 acres in section 26, Berrien township. Buzzard had no means of going from his farm to the public highway, running north and south'on west side of Weed’s land; and on March 3, 1859, he obtained a written license from Weed, by which the latter granted to Buzzard the right to use the south 20 feet of said 91 acres as a private road, leading from the Buzzard farm to the public highway. A few years later a public highway was built on the north side of the Buzzard and Weed farms, which connected with the north and south road mentioned above. “ Buzzard and his successors and grantees used said 20-foot strip as a private way from the Buzzard farm to the public highway continuously from 1859 to 1895. “ The plaintiff is the owner of the east 31 acres of said 91 acres, and derives his title from William P. Weed. The plaintiff has title to the east 31 acres of said 91-acre piece. The following concession is made : “ ' It is also conceded that Wright Buzzard and his grantees had possession, open, visible, and under claim of right, of the premises in dispute continuously until the highway was laid in 1884, and that they used it some from that time up to the time the fence was huilt in 1895, but did not use it as much as they did previous to 1884.’ “ Sarah Knapp became the owner of the Buzzard farm in 1872 as a successor of Buzzard, and has since owned it. Kingsley Knapp, acting for Sarah Knapp, shortly thereafter tore down such fence across the right of way. The fence was rebuilt by plaintiff in 1895, and the right of way was not used afterwards by defendant, or those under whom he acted. The plaintiff maintained the fence, and was in the continuous, open, and visible peaceable possession of the land in question under color and claim of right, hostile to defendant and the parties under whom he held, and grubbed out the so-called right of way and raised crops on it, and was in such peaceable possession as aforesaid, from 1895 till the time of the alleged trespass in the spring of 1903, when defendant tore down the fence running east and west on the south line of plaintiff’s land, inclosing said right of way with his lands. “In the spring of 1903 the defendant, acting for Sarah Knapp, tore down the fence and removed it to the land of plaintiff. I find that the writing of March 3, 1859, entered into between Weed and Buzzard, was a personal license, and conveyed no rights running with the land. I find that such license became revocable by the death of Weed, and that consequently it was revoked as early as 1876. I find that such license became revocable by the conveyance of Buzzard to Tuttle in 1864, and that Tuttle acquired no right to use said right of way by such deed. I find that the use and possession of the private way from 1872 to 1895 by Sarah Knapp was open, visible, continuous, and adverse; that such possession was under a claim of right at least from the time of Weed’s death in 1876; and that, having continued for more than 15 years, the right to use such private way became vested in Sarah Knapp by prescription. I find that the possession of said Sarah Knapp was not permissive, but hostile, under a claim of right, and that no written or express notice was necessary from Mrs. Knapp to the plaintiff or his grantors of such claim, as the plaintiff and his grantors must have known the character of her possession and acquiesced in it.\",\n",

       "  'case_summary': \" Landlord and tenant — Covenant in lease — Repairs—Damages. A tenant after having been in possession of certain premises for seven years signed a new lease by which he agreed “ to keep the fences in proper repair, the material for which to be furnished by the lessor.” The landlord did not furnish any material, and the tenant did not repair the fences. The annual rent was $300, payable quarterly. The rent due July 1, 1893, was distrained for and the property replevied. The issue in these three several suits in replevin was made upon the tenant’s plea of no rent in arrear. According to the terms of the lease, some $375 are due; that is to say, that if you find that the landlord has kept his covenant, then you will find there is $375 due for rent, and you will find the value of the property distrained, and that will be the valuation put upon it by the tenant himself when he gave his bond. The duty of maintaining this fence, by the lease is specifically set out, — the fences are to be reasonably good; the landlord is to furnish material, and the tenant is to perform the labor of putting up the fences; that is the pinch of the case.] The rental value of this property between the parties is $300 a year in good condition, so you need give yourselves no concern about finding out what the property was worth. It was worth $300; the parties have settled that by their own papers. It was worth $300 with good ordinary fences; in addition to this $300, it was worth the' labor necessary to plant these fences.] It would therefore be unreasonable to ask this tenant, at his own expense, to put up fences that should enure to some other tenant after the expiration of his lease.] They say that all they requested was an estimate of the materials wanting and that that estimate never came. The tenant says that they refused to talk with him about it; that they refused to allow him for what he had done; that the $10.00 that they had agreed to pay him was never paid, and that there was a difference between them about the expense of putting up the fence around the house, and that they would not allow him for the materials he had furnished; upon the other hand it appears that Bunting’s bills were paid and that there was an allowance made on work as well as material in putting up the fence around the house. If you shall come to the conclusion that these fences were permitted to get out of repair and remain out of repair so that the tenant could not restrain his stock, and could not reasonably use the land for the purposes for which it was rented, and that the fault was with the landlord, and not with the tenant, then you may allow the tenant damages, and the damages, the measure of damages, will be the difference in the value of the land with and without the fences. What was it worth for the purpose for which it was rented, without the fences being out of repair ? If you find the fault was with the tenant, then the landlord is entitled to the whole of it. If you find therefore for the tenant, you will find the difference in the value of the property as rented between $300 a year and the necessary labor of putting up the fences, and what it was really worth for the purposes for which it was rented with the fences out of repair, and that difference you will deduct from the rent now claimed. It is agreed, if you find for the landlord, that you find a certain sum due for rent.' It all relates to the fencing.\",\n",

Hence this case. The defendant contended, as stated in his History of the Case, “ that the road having been willed, laid out and opened thirty-three feet north from his line, it would remain so, until changed under proceedings for that purpose in court.” At the close of the testimony, the court, Waddell, P. J., charged the jury: We say to you that under the circumstances of this case and under the evidence, these supervisors must take that road as they find it, and they have no power to change its location. I do not mean by that, gentlemen, are there tracks there where wagons have traveled,, but is there a roadbed defined, such as is customary and usual in country roads ? The defendant has asked me to charge you upon some points which he has submitted for my consideration, involving, as he understands it, the law in the case. That the evidence adduced on the part of the defendant clearly shows that the road in question was laid out and opened thirty-three feet wide north of the defendant’s line, and upon ground dedicated to the public by the will of George Ashbridge and accepted as such by the township ; the supervisors cannot now claim more ground than thirty-three feet, and the defendant must be acquitted. That the road in question was laid out and opened on the ground willed by George Ashbridge for a public road, thirty-three feet wide north of the wall built by the defendant, and, having once been laid out and opened, cannot be altered except by a new and original proceeding according to the road law. That if the jury believe that Hoopes Marshall occupied no part of the public road laid out and opened on the ground willed by George Ashbridge for a public road, the defendant is not guilty of the offence with which he is charged and shall be acquitted. That there is no evidence in this case for the jury to find that the ground upon which the stone wall was built was ever taken and occupied by the public for a highway according to law. That under all the evidence in this case the court should direct the jury to acquit the defendant.

It is doubtful whether a right to pass, not in a particular line, but everywhere over the premises over which the right is claimed, may be acquired by prescription as a right of way. On the issue whether the plaintiff had acquired a right to use as a passageway the entire area of certain premises before the defendant purchased the same, where it appeared that the parties had substituted another way therefor, and had continued to use the substituted way for many years without objection, it was held that equity would not interfere to compel the defendant to remove a permanent building erected by him on the premises. Two BILLS IN equity, filed in the Superior Court in January, 1889, to enjoin the defendant from interfering with a way in the city of Worcester, and to compel him to remove a building and fences therefrom. The defendant’s new building extended east from Main Street 80.2 feet, leaving the passageway between it and the building on the south side of Layard Place of a uniform width of nine feet and four inches. The area between the east end of Richmond’s new building and the twenty-foot passageway was left open from the completion of .the building in 1878 until 1887, during which time teams passed and repassed over the open area around the southeast corner of the building to and from the premises of the respective plaintiffs. This fence was erected by the defendant in consequence of a controversy between him and Mrs. Starkie as to the condition in which the area forming the back yard of the new building was kept, and it enclosed part of the paved surface. While the defendant was erecting his building in 1878, the plaintiff Green was abroad, and did not know of it until his return' after its completion. Since the filing of the final decrees, the defendant has removed the fence and post, and all other obstructions to the way, in conformity with the decrees, so that the passageway is now in width and form substantially as it was during the nine years from 1878 to 1887. There were but two of the commissioners present, and they were inspecting the way. At this same meeting a son of the plaintiff Starkie was present. Since the final decrees were filed, the plaintiff Green has informed the presiding justice that he did not express to the commission his wishes in relation to the location of the way.\",\n",

These defendants do not claim any right to prevent the plaintiff from utilizing his mill property as an ice field in the winter season, why then should they he upheld in willfully appropriating to their own use the product of the plaintiff’s property ? The use of the mill is lost to the plaintiff in order that he may harvest ice from his mill pond. The controversy here is not whether the plaintiff has unlawfully • shut out tide water, but whether, having done so and made an ice pond, the defendants who neither do nor can lawfully object,. are justified in trespassing upon bis possession and carrying away his ice. If the defendants were not lessees when the ice sued for was taken they were strangers to the title and had no right to enter upon the premises.',\n",

On the trial, one of the plaintiffs testified, by interrogatories, that the widow of Roath, some time after the building of the house, said to her, (plaintiff,) “She was a fool for building the house, and if she had her way she would tear it down, if she could get her money back.” And further testified, over defendant’s objection, “She also said she had been to see her lawyers, Barnes & Cumming, and they told her * * * she offered, if we would do -this, to give us up the house on Ellis street, but this was never done:” ■ Held, That it was error to admit that portion of the testimony objected to by defendant.

The dispute in this case is as to where the westerly line of the property sold to Bunker is. The plaintiff claims it is line A B on the annexed diagram; the defendant that it is line C D. The action is brought to restrain the defendants from using the rear wall of the building fronting on Greenwich street, which is erected on line C D, and also from occupying or using the space between lines A B and G D. The action was referred. The referee reported that the plaintiff’s westerly boundary line was G D, and therefore the defendants had a right to use the triangular space.

In an action for damage caused by defendant’s sheep eating and destroying plaintiff’s hay stacked on land occupied by defendants as lessees, testimony that lessor had permitted hay to remain on the land held admissable as against objection that the lease was the best evidence and contained no such reservation, such testimony being competent to prove license by lessee’s predecessors, and the subsequent consent of the lessee recognizing and continuing such license. In an action for damages involving the issue whether defendant’s sheep had been driven or intentionally permitted to go upon plaintiff’s hay, evidence as to the condition of the fences inclosing the haystaeks was admis-sble, being competent to show what plaintiff had done to distinguish his hay from other hay on the premises, and to serve as a foundation for other testimony on an issue of whether trespass was intentional or willful. In an action for damages caused by sheep destroying hay stacked on land occupied by defendants, who were charged with willful trespass, an instruction on the duty of the parties as to fences stating that plaintiff was not required to fence, and that it was the duty of defendants to restrain their sheep, held not objectionable as imposing on defendants the duty of guarding plaintiff’s hay. An action for damages caused by sheep destroying hay stacked on land occupied by defendants, whether plaintiff could have done more than he did to prevent the damage after discovery of the trespass, held, a question for the jury. In an action for damages caused by sheep destroying hay stacked on land occupied by defendants, a requested instruction that plaintiff could not recover for loss of “any” hay left on land which he could have used, or for a loss of his cattle through lack of food, held properly refused, because plaintiff was not seeking to recover for hay not destroyed, and because he was thereby denied recovery for loss of cattle regardless of quantity of hay left. In an action for damages caused by sheep destroying hay, where the court charged that defendants would not be liable except on proof of a willful driving of sheep on hay or the intentional permitting them to go thereon, a requested instruction that no duty was imposed on the defendants to dog their sheep for the purpose of keeping them from plaintiff’s hay was properly refused, as misleading. In an action for damages caused by sheep destroying hay, an instruction that defendants were Háble for the acts of their employes, including the foreman in charge of the sheep, held, warranted by evidence that such foreman was present at the time of the trespass complained of. The case was presented, by plaintiff in the trial court upon the theory that defendants were bailees of the hay in question. Plaintiff’s action for damages caused!

While the filing of a plot, showing streets thereon, constitutes a dedication to the public, the filing of a plot of land on the seashore, showing the location of the ocean, does not amount to a dedication of the beach. Where the directors of a company orally declared, when selling lots from a plot of lands fronting on the ocean, that no buildings should be placed between certain lots on the ocean, and none were maintained there for over twenty years, such declaration was sufficient to show a dedication to the public. Where the directors of a corporation engaged in selling its lots informed the purchasers that the space between the ocean and a certain street should be open, the authority of the directors to make such declarations cannot be questioned in a proceeding to secure a preliminary injunction to restrain the obstruction of such space. While acceptance is a necessary element of dedication, an acceptance by the public will be presumed, where the dedication is beneficial to the public and imposes no burden; and such presumption will be exercised, where land between a street and the ocean was dedicated to public use. Where the land between a street and the ocean was dedicated to public use, and it was provided that no buildings should be erected thereon, the erection of a bathhouse and a fence on the shore line was an obstruction of the right of a person who had bought a lot upon the street upon faith in the dedication. Where the land between a street and the ocean was dedicated as a space that should ever be open and unobstructed to the view of the ocean of those persons living on and using the street, the right of such persons was not lost because the ocean washed away the land up to the street line. Property dedicated to the public for one purpose cannot be used for another public purpose inconsistent with the dedication, or which interfered with the original purpose. Where the charter of a municipality granted by the General Assembly authorized the town to grant franchises to erect wharves and piers on the beach, the town had no authority to permit the erection of a bathhouse on the beach which had been dedicated to the public use. Where a property owner was injured by the erection of a bathhouse on the ocean beach, which had been dedicated to the public, he could enjoin such erection, though an indictment would lie to prevent the encroachment, and though upon conviction of an encroachment the Court might order a removal, and though it was the duty of the municipality to prevent encroachment. Where an owner of land had the right to a view across land which had been dedicated to the public to be kept open, he was entitled to enjoin an obstruction of this view; there being an injury peculiar to him and different from that to the general public. Where the land between the ocean and the street upon which complainant’s property abutted had been dedicated to the public, to be kept, open and uninclosed, the complainant could enjoin the erecction of buildings upon the land which would cut off his view of the ocean; such erection causing him pecuniary damage by decreasing the value of his property. Where a bathhouse had already been built upon a beach dedicated to the public, a mandatory injunction will not be issued to enforce its removal, on rule to show cause for a preliminary injunction to restrain its erection and maintenance. In the plot certain avenues, streets and highways were dedicated to the use of the public. Among the avenues so dedicated was one known as Surf Avenue, which extends along the ocean front and parallel thereto, and Baltimore Avenue, which leads into Surf Avenue at right angles thereto, and the space between Surf Avenue and the ocean, it is claimed, was also dedicated to the public as a space that should be ever open and unobstructed to the view of the ocean by persons living on and using said avenues. The Commissioners of Rehoboth, one of the defendants, had control of and sujeervision over the said avenues, streets and highways, and in January, 1911, leased a part of Surf Avenue and the shore at the foot of Baltimore Avenue to Charles P. Hill for the purpose of erecting thereon bath houses. The bill further alleged that under the terms of said lease the said Charles P. Hill was permitted to build a board fence, inclosing the bath houses on three sides, to such a height as to obstruct the complainant’s view of the ocean and to prevent his use of the whole of Surf Avenue and the shore for the purposes for which they were dedicated.',\n",

In a will devising to one all that 'parcel of land, situate in S. County, “where I now reside,” containing forty-five acres, more or less, the word “now” is not a limitation, but an item of description, and does not of itself exclude from the devise after-acquired property, annexed to and enlarging the devised tract. A devise of a described tract “on which I now reside” held to pass to the devisee a tract of thirty-three acres which was acquired after the making of the will by the testator for the purpose of adding it to the tract on which he resided, and which he did in fact annex thereto, by effecting a unity of possession and actual occupation. At the time the will was made the testator owned and resided on a tract of land described as sét forth in the will, and containing about forty-five acres. Thereafter he conveyed twelve acres, part of this tract, being a lot not contiguous to the rest of it, and about the same time acquired by deed another lot containing thirty-three acres and located contiguous to the land which he had theretofore owned and devised as aforesaid. At the time of making the will he resided on the tract described therein, and at his death resided on the tract as changed as above stated. By the bill the executor alleged that Margaret E. Polite, the life tenant under item fifth, and Joseph M. Martin, the devisee thereunder in remainder, claimed that this thirty-three acre tract was a part of the tract devised to them, and that the residuary legatees claimed it to be a part of the estate of the deceased which had not been particularly devised, and, therefore, should be sold by the executor. A demurrer to the bill by Margaret E. Polite for want of equity was overruled, and thereafter she answered the bill, claiming therein that the testator by the exchange of the two tracts intended that the thirty-three acre tract of land acquired after making the will became a part of the land described in the fifth item as “the place where I now reside”; that he in his lifetime declared such to be his intention; and that as further evidence of such intention he used and occupied the after-acquired tract as part of the place on which he resided at the time of making the will and at the time of his death. At the hearing of the cause, evidence was produced to show that by declarations by the testator his purpose in acquiring the thirty-three acre tract was to make it part of the home place.\",\n",

Adverse Possession — Letter Soliciting Quitclaim Deed no Becognir tion of Title. Quieting Title — Plaintiff’s Employee Could not Disturb Plaintiff’s Possession. In an action .to quiet title, wherein plaintiffs averred possession at beginning of suit, the court might quiet title, notwithstanding testimony of a witness that a traet of 141 aeres, which he had purchased, was exclusive of the 3 acres in controversy and that as to the land in controversy he was the mere employee of plaintiff; his presence as such employee not disturbing plaintiffs’ possession. Quieting Title — Plea Held Insufficient to Show Title Claimed by Defendant. In an action to quiet title, wherein plaintiff claimed to have been in continuous adverse possession of the land for 43 years, and wherein the defendant had the opportunity of showing that she held merely an estate in remainder not accruing until after the death of a certain person, her plea claiming some title and estate, but not asserting that her claim was .well founded, was insufficient, as a party who would rely upon any particular estaté must plead it, since the end and office of such an action is to. call on defendant to assert whatever title he has so that it may be adjudicated. Quieting Title — Distinction Between “Action to Quiet Title” and “Action to Remove Cloud” on Title Stated. An “action to quiet title,” wherein plaintiff asserts his own estate and declares generally that defendant claims some estate in the land, without defining it, and avers that the claim is without foundation, and calls on defendant to set forth the nature of liis claim, so that it may be determined by decree, differs from a “suit to remove a cloud,” in that plaintiff therein declares on his own title, and also avers the source and nature of defendant’s claim, points out its defect, and prays that it may be declared void as a cloud on plaintiff’s estate. After a decree for plaintiffs in an action to quiet title, it was within the trial court’s discretion to refuse to open the case and grant a further hearing merely to allow a third person to deny that he had employed one as attorney, though plaintiff had testified that he had. The plaintiffs claim that they are now and for forty-three years last past have been the owners in fee simple of a tract of land in Marion County, and have been in the open, notorious, exclusive, and adverse possession of said premises for forty-three years next prior to the commencement of this suit; that the defendant claims some right, title and estate in the property, which claim is without right, and that she has no title whatsoever to the land or any part thereof. The prayer is for the decree usual in suits to quiet title. The answer is as follows: “Defendant, for her answer to plaintiffs’ complaint on file herein, admits that she claims some right, title, and estate in the real property described in plaintiffs’ complaint. Except as herein admitted, defendant denies each and every allegation set forth and contained in said complaint and the whole thereof.” The Circuit Court entered a decree to the effect that the plaintiffs are the owners in fee simple and entitled to the possession of the premises, and that their title should be quieted against the defendant and all parties claiming under her.\",\n",

That during the occupancy by Crawford, the complainant built a fence on the line between the thirty and seventy feet lots, which fence was standing at the time of the filing of the bill. For a description of the premises conveyed, the deed of Jordan to Crawford was referred to. The bill then charges that Littlefield, at the time he took the deed of Crawford, knew that there was a mistake in the deed of Busby to Jordan, and that in right and equity the southerly part of the lot, being the seventy feet on Chestnut street by one hundred feet deep, was the property of the complainant. He admits that in July or August, 1850, he bargained with Busby for the northerly end of the Trickey lot for the sum of $1,200 ; but he “ affirms” that when Busby first proposed to sell the premises, he said he would sell a lot thirty-two feet in width on Chestnut street, and running back the same width across the lot; that he and Busby went together to examine the house and lot, and paced across the front. He then admits that the description of the land in the deed to him is erroneous, as charged in the bill; that it was not the intention of either of the parties that the whole of the Trickey lot should be conveyed; but he says that it was expressly agreed between Busby and himself that a lot thirty-two feet in width off the northerly end should be conveyed, and that no other lot was ever sold by Busby or bought by him. He admits that after the delivery of the deed, he took possession of the house, and occupied the premises under the deed, and that Busby occupied the house on the southerly end of the lot, as alleged in the bill; but he denies that the lots were ever divided or fenced off, or that there was ever any particular occupation or use up to any particular line or mark on either side. He then alleges that some months after he had taken possession of the premises, he discovered for the first time that the deed purported to convey only thirty feet, and that he was surprised at the discovery.

       "  'case_summary': \" It seems that the early rule in this State required a person farming land to protect his crops with a good and sufficient fence from cattle lawfully running at large. It also seems, that when township organization was adopted and townships given power to prohibit the running at large of stock, in case of all townships that did so prohibit it, the rule last referred to ceased to be applicable, and the owners of stock became liable for their trespasses as at the common law. This court holds that the act of July 1, 1874, concerning the running at large of stock, abrogated the Illinois rule, and that by its force and effect, the common law rule at once revived. This statute applied only to those who suffered or permitted such animals to run at large, and had no- application to such animals escaping against the will of the owner and without his fault or neglb gence, as in this case at bar, and set forth in the said propositions of law submitted to the court. In the case of Frederick v. White, 73 Ill. 590, the right of recovery was based squarely upon the fact that defendant suffered his stock to run at large repeatedly. Only reasonable effort to restrain the bull [horses] was required.” Weide v. Thiel, 9 Ill. App. In the enactment of this statute the legislature did not pretend to relieve owners of land from fencing the same. This section shall not be construed to require such fence in order to maintain an action for injury done by animals running at large contrary to law.” Applying any reasonable rule of construction, this section means simply, that the owner of stock shall be liable for all dam ages where the owner of the inclosure has it surrounded by a good and sufficient fence, and makes one exception only, and that is that the fence shall not be necessary to maintain the action if the stock is running at large contrary to law; but in all other cases the fence is absolutely necessary to entitle the owner of the premises to recover damages. Applying this rule, as laid down by our Supreme Court and above cited, as to what constitutes a running at large, there must be some act of permission, omission or negligence by the owner of the stock before such stock can be said to be running at large contrary to law. And if the common law is in force in this State, th'e above is a sufficient-answer to the labored argument of counsel for appellant, that he is not liable because he did not permit or suffer his stock to run at large, or was not guilty of negligence in the common acceptation of the term.\",\n",

Use of Lot in Connection with Home.—See facts where held that occupation and use of part of a lot as horse and wood yard in connection with the residence adjoining kept up its character as homestead and its exemption from execution, although enclosed with houses leased so as to be abandoned as parts of the homestead. Plaintiff below, the appellee Fritter, claimed the land sold as a part of his homestead. He brought this suit to establish his homestead rights, and to have the deed canceled, to be quieted in his possession, etc. Defendants answered admitting that they had bought the land under the execution sale, but denied that it was a part of plaintiff’s homestead. The form of the petition in the first part of it was as in trespass to try title, but in addition thereto he set up the fact of the levy and sale, that the deed was a cloud upon his title, and the fact that the land was a part of his homestead in the town of Brackett. The court overruled the general demurrer to the petition, and upon the evidence rendered judgment for the plaintiff sustaining the homestead claim, and canceled the deed. The court then concludes as the law of the case that the temporary renting of the business house on the homestead lots was not of such a character as to render it subject to forced sale, and that plaintiff should recover. Hence we contend that the general demurrer should have been sustained. A place to exercise the calling or business of the head of a family is the place or house in which such calling or business is carried on. On the contrary, he states that he had not pursued any such calling or business. Hence we contend that it is immaterial whether he rented the business houses temporarily- or permanently, nor does it matter what the intention of appellee may have been. The fact that he was renting the buildings and using the revenues arising from such rents is conclusive that he was not using the premises as either a homestead or place of business.',\n",

In February, 1892, John H. Lowndes drove a pile about thirty-five feet below high-water mark, in the line of said upland dividing line extended, and from that pile drove a straight row of fourteen piles tending a little to the north of said division line extended.

Hutt, and shall also build and maintain a good post and board fence on each side of their tracks through all inclosures on said premises within three months after said road shall be completed and trains run to Troy, Missouri; also make two crossings over said track in the fields. If the court believes, from the evidence, that the plaintiff, after the decree of forfeiture, presented his intervening petition to the United States court in the case of D. C. Blair, trustee, v. the St. Louis, Hannibal & Keokuk Railroad Company for damages for the taking and appropriating the said strip of land for the right of way of the said railroad, then such act, upon the plaintiff’s part, was a waiver of his right to the possession of said lands, and the verdict will be for the defendant. Hutt to the St. Louis & Keokuk Railroad Company were not complied with, and the decree .of the circuit court of Lincoln county, Missouii, declared said deed forfeited for failure to fulfill and perform the conditions, yet such failure did not, and does not, give the plaintiff any right to said lands as against the St. Louis & Keokuk Railroad Company and its assigns.

If the court believe, from the evidence, that the plaintiff bought the land on which the railroad was constructed and operated, subject to the right of way previously granted by Thomas Gr. Hutt and wife to the defendant railway company, or those under whom it claims, and that said defendant railway company, or those under whom it claims, entered and took possession of and occupied said right of way, by and with the consent of Thomas Gr.

Hutt and wife, and excavated and graded said strip of land and put the same in condition for receiving ties, rails, etc., and the defendant was in possession of said lands at the commencement of this suit, then the presumption is that the St. Louis & Keokuk Railroad Company and its assigns have remained in possession of said lands from the first entry thereof until the commencement of this suit.

Adverse Possession op Land.—One claiming to have acquired a title to land by five years adverse possession, need only show that his adverse possession was held by a substantial inclosuro, and need not prove occupation, cultivation, or use of the premises. What constitutes Prior Possession op Land.—The plaintiff in ejectment who claims to recover on the ground of prior possession alone, without color of title, must show an actual prior possession; and if he shows that he had the land protected by a substantial inclosuro, even if he had not improved or lived on it, this constitutes an actual possession. Proof of Prior Possession.—If the plaintiff in ejectment relies on prior possession alone, without color of title, proof that he had the land inclosed with a fence made of posts eight feet apart, with two rails nailed on, is not sufficient to establish such prior possession. When plaintiff rested, defendants moved for a nonsuit, because plaintiff had not shown such a prior possession as would enable her to recover in ejectment. Plaintiff recovered judgment, and defendants appealed. Such a possession as was proved by plaintiff in this case, has been several times held by the Court to be insufficient to maintain ejectment. The case of Lawrence v. Fulton was ejectment for land in San Francisco outside of the lines of the Van Ness Ordinance. The testimony in favor of plaintiff was much stronger than in this case.',\n",

What Constitutes a Forcible Detainer.—If the entry was unlawful and the detainer was forcible, the defendant is guilty of a forcible detainer, whether he originally obtained possession peaceably or otherwise. Deed as Evidence in Unlawful Detainer.—When the grantee of one in possession brings an action of unlawful detainer against an intruder, the deed of Ms grantor is admissible in evidence in his behalf, not as evidence of title, hut as tending to show a transfer of possession. When One is Not Guilty of Unlawful Detainer.—One'who enters peaceably and in good faith under a claim of title, is not liable for an unlawful detainer, even if he resists the entry of the prior possessor. Evidence in Unlawful Detainer.—The defendant, in an action of unlawful detainer, may introduce evidence that before the plaintiff acquired possession he had exercised acts of dominion over the premises, as tending to, show a claim of title in good faith. Bebutting Evidence in Unlawful Detainer. — If the defendant, in unlawful detainer, for the purpose of showing that he entered on the demanded premises in good faith under a claim of title, offers in evidence a deed, the plaintiff in rebuttal may introduce a prior deed of the grantor to another person. Testimony in Unlawful Detainer.—In an action of unlawful detainer, a deed executed to the defendant after his entry, is not admissible in evidence for any purpose. On the trial defendants introduced deeds, one from Pratt to defendant Bowers, and one from Farrington and others to Bowers, to show that the defendants entered in good faith and under a claim of title. The plaintiffs, to rebut this claim'of entry in good faith, introduced a deed from Pratt to Wilson, made prior to Pratt’s deed to Bowers, and a judgment of Compton against Farrington and others, and a sale by execution of the land, and a Sheriff’s deed in pursuance thereof to Compton, made before Farrington’s deed to Bowers. The plaintiffs recovered judgment in the Court below, and the defendants appealed from the judgment and from an order denying a new trial. One ground of objection to these deeds was that they were evidence of title only. They furnished no evidence of possession in the plaintiffs. They were not admissible as evidence of title; for in this action title cannot be proved, as is generally understood, nor was any attempt made to prove that Williams had title; nor were they admissible as evidence tending to prove possession in the plaintiffs, as we have above seen they could have no such tendency, as the transfer of title is no evidence that the grantee succeeded to the actual possession. The plaintiffs never had the actual possession of any part of this block. Williams and the Dents had the possession, if any one had it other than the defendants. The deeds from Williams and the Dents did not have the effect of ' transferring any possession which they may have had or claimed to have, to the plaintiffs. At the most those deeds transferred to the plaintiffs only a right of possession. But the plaintiffs could not acquire actual possession by virtue of those deeds, except by an actual entry upon and taking actual possession of the premises. So long as the land was fenced on three sides with a natural barrier, the bay or mud flats on the other, the possession of plaintiffs was sufficient to maintain this action.\",\n",

       "  'case_summary': ' Defendant Baird employed a surveyor and located the center line of the lot in accordance with the original plat of the town of Michigan, afterwards the city of Lansing. In making this survey and in locating the center line the surveyor adopted the original monuments. This plat included section 16 on which lot 4 is located. There are six lots in the block fronting on Washington avenue, numbered from 1 to 6, from Shiawassee to Ionia streets; lot 6 being bounded on the south by Ionia street and on the east by Washington avenue. The brick store building on the north of lot 4 was erected in 1885 by Barker and Parker, and is known as the “Barker Block.” The brick building south of lot 4 was erected by one Hinchey in 1891. All the store buildings erected on lots 5 and 6 — and both lots are covered with buildings — are located too far south, and their lines were evidently located with reference to the south line of the Longyear or Buck building. After Barker and Parker had erected their building on the north of lot 4, they discovered that they had encroached upon lot 4 about 15 inches. The owners of lot 4 were not concerned with the location of lots 5 and 6, for the reason that their location did not encroach upon lot 4. The owners of lot 4 have not been shown to have acquiesced in the acts of other lot owners following the Preston- survey, and I am of the opinion that no such acquiescence has been shown in the lines of the Preston survey as makes the lines adopted by \"the owner of lot 6 controlling upon any other lot owner unless, possibly, upon the owner of lot 5. Ever since the establishment of the plat the location and lines of lot 4 could any day have been ascertained and determined to a certainty from the original monument and in the way specified in the plat. Not only this, but the location of lot 4 has for many years been understood. Barker understood he had encroached upon lot 4 with his wall when he purchased a wall easement in 1893. Hinchey understood the Buck line was untrue when he built his north wall upon his own land and told Buck his store was in the street. In the face of this knowledge of the Preston mistake, it cannot be said there has been such an acquiescence among the owners of lots in this block as to establish the Buck building the testing point from which to run lines and measure distances. The Buck line was a. mistake, and has been recognized as such for years, and while it may be the line as between those who have acquiesced in it, it has not become the monument from, which all lots on that side of the block are to be located.',\n",

The plaintiff fell on a cross walk on Green Street, a public highway, where it is intersected by a private way called Lamar-tine Square. The fee of Lamartine Square was in the defendant’s intestate at the time the plaintiff fell. The sidewalk on Green Street was lower than the premises of the intestate and there was a low retaining wall of rubble laid in mortar and water tight, extending along the entire front of the premises on Green Street and surmounted by a picket fence. At the corner of Lamartine Street the top of the wall was about a foot above the sidewalk on Green Street, and at Lamartine Square about a foot and a half above the sidewalk on Green Street. The general slope of Green Street is downward from Lamartine Street to Lamartine Square, there being a drop in that distance of three feet. The top of the wall was about six inches above the land inside it. The plaintiff in company with her sister had been to make a call on Chestnut Avenue, which leads off Green Street on the same side on- which the intestate’s premises were. In going to make this call she had proceeded along Green Street on the side opposite these premises. In returning she passed along the sidewalk on the side of Green Street adjacent to the premises in question. The evidence upon the issue of the plaintiff’s due care, as well as upon the issue of the defendant’s liability, is described in the opinion. A civil engineer called by the defendant testified that in his opinion the land in its natural condition had been cut away, and the wall built for the double purpose of holding back the earth on the premises and affording a foundation support for the fence, that in its natural original state the lowest part of the valley was at a point within the wall and upon the intestate’s estate. A civil engineer called by the plaintiff testified that in his opinion the lowest part of the valley in the natural, original state of the land was outside the wall at a point now Green Street. “ There is no responsibility in this case unless you are satisfied that there was an artificial channel upon that portion of the premises in the vicinity of Green Street and that this artificial channel caused a substantial increase in the flow of water to the southeast corner of the Evans estate, and a substantial increase in the discharge upon the cross walk at the entrance to Lamar-tine Square and that this substantial increase in the flow and discharge contributed to cause the ice at that point upon which the plaintiff fell, and by contributed, I mean formed part of the ice upon which the plaintiff fell.',\n",

The court erred in refusing to allow the defendant to prove the nature and value of the improvements he had placed upon the laud in controversy in good faith; and erred in refusing to allow defendant to prove by his vendor, Wolf, the amount he, Wolf, paid in cash for the land in controversy. The court erred in holding that plaintiff is an innocent purchaser of the land in controversy for valuable consideration paid therefor in good faith. The court erred in concluding, as\\'a matter of law, that plaintiff is not barred by limitation from recovering seventeen-thirtieths of the land in controversy. Defendant acquired the land in 1884, under a perfect chain of title, all of which, including the deed to himself, has been properly of record since 1884; and he has paid all taxes ever since 1884. The court holds that plaintiff is entitled to recover seventeen-thirtieths of this land as an innocent purchaser from a portion of the heirs of the original grantee in 1884, after defendant had acquired it. Plaintiff sued defendant for this land in 1886, alleging that defendant was in actual possession of it, holding it adversely to him, but allowed the suit to be dismissed in 1887, under rule for costs. After suit was dismissed, defendant built a house on the land and fenced in a garden in 1887, and placed in said house, as soon as it was completed, his son-in-law, who has lived in said house and cultivated the garden ever since, as defendant’s tenant, being all the while employed by defendant. Furthermore, during all this period defendant kept all stock not his own driven off of this land, and begun preparations for fencing it as early as 1887 or 1888, by purchasing, and placing thereon posts and wire for fencing material. In the spring of 1890, or 1891, defendant placed a continuous fence around and upon three sides of this land, which fence connected with the inclosures around two of his said fields, respectively, between which was the gap. The court substantially finds them so; and under them the plaintiff is clearly barred by limitation from recovering any part of this land.

The words “all such stone and brick buildings as may have been erected by the said party of the second part, &c., &c., on the demised premises, and he then standing thereon,” does not limit the provisions to buildings to be subsequently erected. The words “ may have been erected” would apply as well to those buildings which were built before the second lease, as to those which were built after the second lease was given. The lessee in the second lease, even though he may not be the same party to whom the first lease was given, yet if he were the assignee of the first lease, and took the second lease before the expiration of the first lease, he comes within the provisions of the covenant in question as the “ party of the second part.” So far as the owner of the premises is concerned, it is a matter of no importance to him whether the buildings iu question were erected by the first lesee or by his assignee. The lease contained an agreement as follows: “And it is hereby further mutually agreed by and between the parties to these presents, for themselves, their heirs and assigns, that at the expiration of the above term of twenty-one years, the said party of the first part, his heirs or assigns, shall and will, at his or their election, either grant .a new lease of the hereby demised premises for the further term of twenty-one years, upon such increase of rent as shall be agreed on, &c., or he or they will pay unto the said party of the second part, his executors, administrators, or assigns, the value in good and lawful money of the United States of America, of all such stone or brick buildings as shall have been erected on the said hereby demised premises by the said party of the second part, his executors, administrators, or assigns.” A provision was then made for determining such value by arbitrators; and it was then provided, that “ within ten days after notice of such appraisement, the party of the first part, his heirs, or assigns, shall make his or their election, either to grant a new lease, or to pay the value of the said buildings.” Certain brick buildings were erected on the premises by the first lessee, and subsequently the plaintiff became assignee of the lease. To this the plaintiff agreed, and the defendant executed a lease to the plaintiff, bearing date March 1, 1S44. This lease was also executed by the plaintiff, and was immediately placed upon record. The plaintiff subsequently changed his mind, and did not go to Europe, but remained here in possession of the premises, paying rent therefor, until the end of this lease, May 1, 1866, when the defendant, having elected not to give another lease, took possession of the premises and leased them to other parties. The lease given by the defendant to the plaintiff, March 1, 1844, was a lease for twenty-one years, and contained a covenant “that at the expiration thereof, the defendant, his successors, or the persons entitled to reversion of the estate, will at their election, either give a new lease for twenty-one years,” (then follows an enumeration of covenants to be contained in such lease if given,) “or will pay to the partyof the second part, his executors, administrators or assigns, the value of such stone or brick buildings as may have teen erected hy the said party of the second part, his executors, administrators or assigns, on the said demised premises, and he then standing thereonand provision is made for ascertaing values by appraisement. It turned that no buildings whatever, had been erected on the premises during the term of the second lease; the only buildings thereon, being those which had been erected during the first lease, which terminated in 1845. Subsequently, Mr. Ray brought his action to have the lease, which had been executed in 1844, reformed by striking out from the election covenant the words limiting payment to buildings erected by the plaintiff, his executors, administrators or assigns, and for damages in case of such reformation, so as to entile him to recover the value of the buildings which had been erected under the first lease. He based his claim for reformation upon a statement made by a clerk of defendant’s, and upon supposed legal effect of the lease which he claimed, was to entitle him to be paid for buildings which had been erected upon the premises during the first lease. The lessees therein covenanted,'at the expiration of their term, to leave the said lots within good and sufficient fence. This lease, also contained the following covenant: “ And it is hereby further mutually agreed and covenanted by and between the parties to these presents aforesaid, that in case no agreement shall be made between them for a further or new lease of the said premises, on or previously to the time of three months before the expiration of the term hereby demised, nor any agreement for the improvements made thereon, that then it shall and may be lawful for the said party of the second part, executors, administrators, or assigns, to remove and talce of all buildings which may have been erected on said premises by the said party of the second part, executors, administrators, or assigns, Sc.” This lease was acknowledged and recorded on the same day; also the same parties, leased of the defendant’s testator the same premises for the term of eighteen years, commencing at the expiration of the previous lease, at the rent of $400, payable quarterly. This lease contained the following covenant, viz. This lease was executed by the appellant as executor and trustee, and by Elisha Morrill as receiver. On the same day the landlord gave the two tenants notice that he elected not to grant a new lease, but to pay “the value of any stone or brick buildings which have been erected on the said premises by the said lessee, or his assigns during the term of the said lease.” Oh the.30th April, 1867, the last day of the term, Mr. Cocks was served with this notice of election. I then said, “Mr. He said Mr. Rhinelander had determined not to pay for the value of the buildings, and referred the witness to the lawyer for the estate.” On May 1st, 1867, the landlord took possession of the builings, and rented them out to other parties, who have been in possession ever since.

Here there was a highway laid out; parties only intended that their land included in the road laid out should be used bv and dedicated to the public, and if from uncertainty as to the line of the road, they permitted the public to use beyond it; still, as their intention was only to dedicate to that line whereon it was, there can be no inference of law of an intention to dedicate beyond it.

Hpw far from the margin of the highway the adjoining owner may make an excavation, without being liable to persons who may fall into it, is to be determined by the jury in each case, having regard to the knowledge of the traveler, the width of the highway, its surroundings and the mode of its use. Franklin street, or alley, was laid out by the owners of land over which it passes, over twenty years before the injury sustained by the defendant; and, although never recorded as a public street or highway, it has been used during all that time by persons with teams, and by persons on foot, at pleasure.

At the time of the injury, there was a pile of stones on the west side of Exchange, in front of defendant’s building, and the middle of the stréet was muddy, so that foot passengers traveled near to defendant’s building.

He further charged them that plaintiff was not bound to know precisely where the legal east line of the alley was; and it would, according to the proof, have been quite impossible for him to obtain such knowledge, if he made use of diligence to do so.

The cause was tried at the Rensselaer circuit, in February, 1864, before a justice of the supreme court, without a jury. The justice decided that the defendants were under no obligation to keep the gate in repair, and, therefore, the action could not be maintained.',\n",

It was the plaintiff’s right that such water should flow there, and indeed all waters that had been accustomed to flow there. Any obstruction to any such waters would give the plaintiffs the right of action. Was this sod dam an obstruction of any such waters ? The jury were instructed that if the opening of the ditch caused more than the customary flow of water on the defendant’s land, he was not bound to receive it, and anything which he might erect to prevent its flowage upon his land would be a lawful countervailing structure. What the defendant did was merely to protect himself against the flooding of his land.',\n",

The provisions of the railroad acts requiring the erection and maintenance of suitable fences, gates, etc., is to be considered, among other things, a safeguard for the protection of the lives of the traveling public, and, to that extent, a police regulation.

The defendants filed their answer and cross-bill in equity, praying the cancellation of the note sued on, and the mortgage executed to secure the same, and alleging in substance that the note was given in purchase of section 17, and the southeast quarter of section 18, in township 72, range 5. On the second day of February, 1871, plaintiff filed an amendment to the petition, alleging that the note was executed for the purchase money of the land above named, and that a mortgage was executed on said premises to secure the same. That there is due $1,110, with interest from April 1, 1870, and $1,110 will become due. Plaintiff prays for the. appointment of a receiver, for judgment for $1,410 and interest at 6 per cent., and for such further sum as may mature on said note before decree, for a foreclosure of the mortgage, and a sale of the premises; and that the excess of proceeds of sale be applied to pay sums not due'on said note with proper rebate, and for general relief.

Defendants have answered admitting complainant’s peaceable possession and asserting an adverse title. The material facts touching the issue stated are as follows: March 13th, 1885, one Diehl conveyed to testator a tract or lot of land in Beverly fronting eighty feet on the east line of Jennings street and extending easterly in depth one hundred and twenty feet, more or less. This tract had a frontage on Jennings street of forty feet and extended along Church street one hundred and sixty feet and- embraced forty feet in the rear of the tract first purchased. By these two purchases testator became the owner of a rectangular tract one hundred and twenty feet in frontage on Jennings street and one hundred and sixty feet on Church street. Thereafter testator erected a dwelling-house on the land so owned by him. The dwelling-house was located on the land described in the first conveyance above referred to and a lawn was made by testator embracing the remaining portion of his land, and tlie whole was then surrounded and enclosed by a fence and no visible or distinguishable trace was left of the lines which originally divided the two tracts of land. The dwelling-house was then occupied by testator as his home during the remainder of his lifetime, and the surrounding land above referred to as a lawn was so used and enjoyed by him. Testator owned no other house or home in Beverly. Defendants claim that the land secondly purchased by testator does not pass by the above-quoted devise of “my house in Beverly.” Messrs.

He further alleges that said trustees and commonalty of Clarksburg, refuse to make a crossing for horses and wagons across said pavement, if the same is erected, so that the plaintiff can cross and recross as he has hitherto been accustomed to do; the plaintiff therefore prays that the said trustees, &c. be enjoined and restrained from building, erecting and constructing said pavement on his said lots until they have condemned said ground upon said lots upon which they are erecting and constructing said pavement in the manner prescribed by law, and make a crossing for horses and wagons for the plaintiff over said pavement to pass into and from said lots, &c. The defendants, the trustees and commonalty, &c., answered the bill, and admit that plaintiff owns in fee simple the lots set out in the bill, but insists that all the ground on which the pavement is being laid, is not included in the lines of the said lots. In other words they ansAver, admitting they did direct the street commissioner in November, 1875, to construct the pavement on the north side of Main street, and on the south side of plaintiff’s lot,-from the southwest corner of said lot to the southeast corner of the lot owned by Holmes, and that said pavement was ordered to be laid and constructed without the consent of plaintiff. “Further answering, the defendants deny that the plaintiff-has any right to obstruct or pre vent the laying of said pavement, or that the same, if laid, will interfere with any right of the plaintiff, or take any ground, or any part of said lot, to the use of which the public are not entitled. In other words, the defendants deny that the plaintiff has any right, under any pretense of title to the same, to prevent or obstruct the building of said pavement, or to deny to the public, the town of Clarks-burg, the use of the ground proposed to be taken for the same. Defendants charge that by the repeated acts of plaintiff, the said ground has been dedicated to the public, and that he has- no right to obstruct, them in the use and enjoyment of the same, or to prevent these defendants, or their employes, from laying a pavement thereon for use ancl convenience of the public. “Further answering, defendants say that it has not been usual for them to lay and build crossings on pavements for the benefit of private individuals, and that they did not refuse to put in a crossing for said plaintiff as he alleges, as he never gave them the opportunity to either refuse or grant such privilege by making application for the same.” To the said answer plaintiff replied generally.\",\n",

Adverse possession, to defeat by limitation one having the title, must have been, in its inception and continuously for twenty years, hostile, adverse, 'visible and exclusive, and acquired and retained under claim of title inconsistent with that of the true owner; but such claim need not be rightful, nor supported by paper title. All presumptions of law are in favor of the holder of the legal title to lands, and he will be considered as constructively in possession thereof unless they are proven to be in the actual, hostile occupancy of another, under a claim of title. The claim of an easement, a permissive possession, a tenancy, or the possession of a mere trespasser entering and holding without claim of title, is not adverse to the rightful owner, and cannot ripen into a title by lapse of time. Such possession is adverse only to the extent of the actual enclosure, which must be definite and notorious.\",\n",

       "  'case_summary': \" The complaint is in the usual form, averring: ‘ ‘That the said boundary line between the lands aforesaid is as follows, to wit: Commencing at a point in the east boundary line of the Amos N. King donation land claim, which point is the northwest corner ©f-the W. W. Chapman donation land claim, and also the southwest corner of the D. H. Lownsdale donation land claim (this corner was marked by a stone monument), thence northerly along the east boundary line of the Amos N. Kingdonation land claim to a point which is ninety-three (98) feet easterly, measured along the south boundary line of B street in said city, from a point where the south boundary line of said B street is intersected by the west boundary line of Fourteenth street in said city, as extended by the common council of said city of Portland, county of Multnomah and State of Oregon, said line being the easterly boundary line of the said plaintiff’s land and the westerly boundary line of the defendant’s land. ” The separate answers of each of the defendants, except the-city of Portland, are substantially the same and deny that the boundary line commences on the east boundary line of the Amos N. King donation land claim, other than as hereinafter set forth, or that said point is the northwest corner of the W. W. Chapman and D. H. Lownsdale donation land claims, or that said line runs thence northerly along the east boundary line of the Amos N. King donation claim to a point which is 93 feet easterly, measured along the south boundary line of B street from a point where said B street is intersected by the west boundary line of Fourteenth street, as alleged by plaintiff, or that said line is the easterly boundary line of plaintiff’s lands or the westerly boundary line of the lands belonging to these defendants. These defendants, further answering, allege ‘ ‘that the true and correct east boundary line of the A. N. King donation land claim, as established by the proper officers of the United States to said King, commences at a point on the base line, which is three chains east of the southwest corner of the southwest quarter of section 33, township 1 north, of range 1 east of the Willamette meridian, and running thence north 20° 15' east 20.60 chains to a point near and intersecting the south line of B street, as now laid out and existing in. said city of Portland, county of Multnomah and State of Oregon; and that the southwest corner of the donation land claim of said D. H. Lownsdale and Nancy Lownsdale, as established by the officers of the government of the United States and patented to them, commences at a point on said line last described north 20° 15' east and 6.15 chains distant from the said commencement point of said King’s donation land claim; thence running north 20° 15' east 14.45 chains intersecting and near the south boundary of said B street, and distant in a westerly direction from thfe west line of Fourteenth street, as originally laid out, 77 feet, more or less, to the said east line of King’s donation land claim and the west boundary line of said Lownsdale donation land claim as herein set forth. The answer of the city of Portland, after denying and alleging substantially the same facts concerning the true boundary as in the answer of the other defendants, alleges that there is a public street through the lands of defendants Brigham and Tufts. The cause was referred to a referee to report the testimony and conclusions of fact and law; and on the coming-in of his report, the court below modified the same and found “that the eastern boundary line of the donation land claim of Amos N. King and the western boundary line of the donation land claim of Daniel H. and Nancy Lowns-dale, as originally run, is a line commencing at the stone monument at the northwest corner of the donation land claim of W. W. Chapman, which is also the southwest corner of the donation land claim of Daniel H. and Nancy Lownsdale; and thence running northerly on a line north -degrees east to a point in the south line of John H. Couch donation land claim, which is seventy (70) feet from the west line of Fourteenth street in the city of Portland, Oregon, sometimes called ‘Old Fourteenth street. ’ ” The court also found that by reason of adverse possession of the plaintiff Amos N. King, as found by the referee, he, said Amos N. King, is the owner in fee simple of all the lands described in the complaint which lie north of the south line of Morrison street, if extended westerly, and west of a line running north 20° 15' east from the stone monument at the northwest corner of the W. W. Chapman claim to the south line of the John H. Couch donation land claim, where there is an iron post set by C. W. Burrage. A decree was entered against the city of Portland, adjudging that Morrison street does not extend further west than the west line of Fourteenth street. A decree was then entered establishing the line between plaintiffs and defendants Cole, Cavanaugh, Soderstrand and Esser as one running from the stone monument at the southwest corner of the Lownsdale claim to a point in the south line of the Couch claim, which is 70 feet west of the west line of Old Fourteenth street, and between plaintiffs and defendants Brigham and Tufts as a line running from the stone monument at the northwest corner of the Chapman claim north SO3 15' east to the iron post set by C. W. Burrage in the south line of the Couch claim.\",\n",
