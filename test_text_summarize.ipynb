This space was so used by Mr. Clark up to the time of his death in 1860. The defendant now seeks to take in all or a part of the land thrown out by Clark when he moved the road fence back, and by this bill the plaintiff seeks to restrain him from so doing. Neither can I find that the fence erected or sought to be erected by the defendant is or will be an obstruction of this street. I am of opinion the defendant Iras the right to build his fence on the line where it used to be, where it was when Mr. Clark bought the farm, and I cannot say but that the fence being built is on or within that line. Numerous witnesses for the plaintiff testified that they had been familiar with the Clark property for thirty or forty years, and that they had never seen a fence in front of it “so far out in the street ” as the one started by the defendant; that there had been “no fence so far out for forty years” to their recollection; that said fence was in the road bed; that it was an obstruction to the road; that it “ stands in what was the road, and what has been the road for thirty years, so far as my recollection goes.”.....Witnesses for the defendant testified that Clark moved the fence back when he bought the property, and used the space thus made by the new fence for wagons, as previously reported by the Master. He finds as a matter of fact that “ Judson Clark moved his fences back on the side next his house, leaving an open space between the fence and the road bed some twenty-five or thirty feet in width.

Defendant owned three adjoining lots, and erected a house on the middle one, fronting on the street and covering the whole width of the lot.

Weed. Kingsley Knapp, acting for Sarah Knapp, shortly thereafter tore down such fence across the right of way. The fence was rebuilt by plaintiff in 1895, and the right of way was not used afterwards by defendant, or those under whom he acted. “In the spring of 1903 the defendant, acting for Sarah Knapp, tore down the fence and removed it to the land of plaintiff. I find that the writing of March 3, 1859, entered into between Weed and Buzzard, was a personal license, and conveyed no rights running with the land. I find that such license became revocable by the death of Weed, and that consequently it was revoked as early as 1876. I find that such license became revocable by the conveyance of Buzzard to Tuttle in 1864, and that Tuttle acquired no right to use said right of way by such deed. I find that the use and possession of the private way from 1872 to 1895 by Sarah Knapp was open, visible, continuous, and adverse; that such possession was under a claim of right at least from the time of Weed’s death in 1876; and that, having continued for more than 15 years, the right to use such private way became vested in Sarah Knapp by prescription. I find that the possession of said Sarah Knapp was not permissive, but hostile, under a claim of right, and that no written or express notice was necessary from Mrs. Knapp to the plaintiff or his grantors of such claim, as the plaintiff and his grantors must have known the character of her possession and acquiesced in it.',\n",

He admits that in July or August, 1850, he bargained with Busby for the northerly end of the Trickey lot for the sum of $1,200 ; but he “ affirms” that when Busby first proposed to sell the premises, he said he would sell a lot thirty-two feet in width on Chestnut street, and running back the same width across the lot; that he and Busby went together to examine the house and lot, and paced across the front.

The form of the petition in the first part of it was as in trespass to try title, but in addition thereto he set up the fact of the levy and sale, that the deed was a cloud upon his title, and the fact that the land was a part of his homestead in the town of Brackett. The court overruled the general demurrer to the petition, and upon the evidence rendered judgment for the plaintiff sustaining the homestead claim, and canceled the deed. The court then concludes as the law of the case that the temporary renting of the business house on the homestead lots was not of such a character as to render it subject to forced sale, and that plaintiff should recover. Hence we contend that the general demurrer should have been sustained.

The plaintiff did not obtain possession of the disputed parcel by fencing it where the defendant removed the fence the day after it was built, nor did such removal constitute a forcible entry. A plaintiff in ejectment having proved a deed of the premises in question to her predecessor in title, and his possession thereunder, makes a prima facie case and is entitled to recover unless the defendant proves that the plaintiff’s predecessor did not have legal title, or that he himself acquired title by adverse possession. Evidence of a conversation wherein the plaintiff’s predecessor stated to the defendant’s predecessor that he claimed the disputed parcel, but that the defendant’s predecessor might use it until wanted, is admissible to show that the defendant’s predecessor’s possession was subordinate to that of the plaintiff’s predecessor, and not adverse thereto. Evidence examined, and held, that the adverse possession of the defendant and his predecessor was a question of fact for the jury.

What constitutes Prior Possession op Land.—The plaintiff in ejectment who claims to recover on the ground of prior possession alone, without color of title, must show an actual prior possession; and if he shows that he had the land protected by a substantial inclosuro, even if he had not improved or lived on it, this constitutes an actual possession. Proof of Prior Possession.—If the plaintiff in ejectment relies on prior possession alone, without color of title, proof that he had the land inclosed with a fence made of posts eight feet apart, with two rails nailed on, is not sufficient to establish such prior possession. When plaintiff rested, defendants moved for a nonsuit, because plaintiff had not shown such a prior possession as would enable her to recover in ejectment. Such a possession as was proved by plaintiff in this case, has been several times held by the Court to be insufficient to maintain ejectment. The case of Lawrence v.

Testimony in Unlawful Detainer.—In an action of unlawful detainer, a deed executed to the defendant after his entry, is not admissible in evidence for any purpose. The plaintiffs, to rebut this claimhouseof entry in good faith, introduced a deed from Pratt to Wilson, made prior to Pratt’s deed to Bowers, and a judgment of Compton against Farrington and others, and a sale by execution of the land, and a Sheriff’s deed in pursuance thereof to Compton, made before Farrington’s deed to Bowers. The plaintiffs recovered judgment in the Court below, and the defendants appealed from the judgment and from an order denying a new trial. One ground of objection to these deeds was that they were evidence of title only. They furnished no evidence of possession in the plaintiffs.

The chief question was as to the true width and location of the unopened street. Neal’s lot was near the river, but at the time he purchased the same Willis street had not been extended thereto. In thus enclosing the same Neal placed a fence on the eastward side of his lot, running, as he contends, with the northwestward side or line of Willis street extended to the Choptank River. But Hopkins claims that Neal placed said fence', not on the proper northwestward line or side of Willis street, extended, but on the contrary, that he embraced within his enclosure a strip of land not included within the parcel of land bought by him.\",\n",

He further alleges that said trustees and commonalty of Clarksburg, refuse to make a crossing for horses and wagons across said pavement, if the same is erected, so that the plaintiff can cross and recross as he has hitherto been accustomed to do; the plaintiff therefore prays that the said trustees, &c. be enjoined and restrained from building, erecting and constructing said pavement on his said lots until they have condemned said ground upon said lots upon which they are erecting and constructing said pavement in the manner prescribed by law, and make a crossing for horses and wagons for the plaintiff over said pavement to pass into and from said lots, &c.

       "  'case_summary': \" The complaint is in the usual form, averring: ‘ ‘That the said boundary line between the lands aforesaid is as follows, to wit: Commencing at a point in the east boundary line of the Amos N. King donation land claim, which point is the northwest corner ©f-the W. W. Chapman donation land claim, and also the southwest corner of the D. H. Lownsdale donation land claim (this corner was marked by a stone monument), thence northerly along the east boundary line of the Amos N. Kingdonation land claim to a point which is ninety-three (98) feet easterly, measured along the south boundary line of B street in said city, from a point where the south boundary line of said B street is intersected by the west boundary line of Fourteenth street in said city, as extended by the common council of said city of Portland, county of Multnomah and State of Oregon, said line being the easterly boundary line of the said plaintiff’s land and the westerly boundary line of the defendant’s land. ” The separate answers of each of the defendants, except the-city of Portland, are substantially the same and deny that the boundary line commences on the east boundary line of the Amos N. King donation land claim, other than as hereinafter set forth, or that said point is the northwest corner of the W. W. Chapman and D. H. Lownsdale donation land claims, or that said line runs thence northerly along the east boundary line of the Amos N. King donation claim to a point which is 93 feet easterly, measured along the south boundary line of B street from a point where said B street is intersected by the west boundary line of Fourteenth street, as alleged by plaintiff, or that said line is the easterly boundary line of plaintiff’s lands or the westerly boundary line of the lands belonging to these defendants. These defendants, further answering, allege ‘ ‘that the true and correct east boundary line of the A. N. King donation land claim, as established by the proper officers of the United States to said King, commences at a point on the base line, which is three chains east of the southwest corner of the southwest quarter of section 33, township 1 north, of range 1 east of the Willamette meridian, and running thence north 20° 15' east 20.60 chains to a point near and intersecting the south line of B street, as now laid out and existing in. said city of Portland, county of Multnomah and State of Oregon; and that the southwest corner of the donation land claim of said D. H. Lownsdale and Nancy Lownsdale, as established by the officers of the government of the United States and patented to them, commences at a point on said line last described north 20° 15' east and 6.15 chains distant from the said commencement point of said King’s donation land claim; thence running north 20° 15' east 14.45 chains intersecting and near the south boundary of said B street, and distant in a westerly direction from thfe west line of Fourteenth street, as originally laid out, 77 feet, more or less, to the said east line of King’s donation land claim and the west boundary line of said Lownsdale donation land claim as herein set forth. The cause was referred to a referee to report the testimony and conclusions of fact and law; and on the coming-in of his report, the court below modified the same and found “that the eastern boundary line of the donation land claim of Amos N. King and the western boundary line of the donation land claim of Daniel H. and Nancy Lowns-dale, as originally run, is a line commencing at the stone monument at the northwest corner of the donation land claim of W. W. Chapman, which is also the southwest corner of the donation land claim of Daniel H. and Nancy Lownsdale; and thence running northerly on a line north -degrees east to a point in the south line of John H. Couch donation land claim, which is seventy (70) feet from the west line of Fourteenth street in the city of Portland, Oregon, sometimes called ‘Old Fourteenth street. ’ ” The court also found that by reason of adverse possession of the plaintiff Amos N. King, as found by the referee, he, said Amos N. King, is the owner in fee simple of all the lands described in the complaint which lie north of the south line of Morrison street, if extended westerly, and west of a line running north 20° 15' east from the stone monument at the northwest corner of the W. W. Chapman claim to the south line of the John H. Couch donation land claim, where there is an iron post set by C. W. Burrage. A decree was entered against the city of Portland, adjudging that Morrison street does not extend further west than the west line of Fourteenth street. A decree was then entered establishing the line between plaintiffs and defendants Cole, Cavanaugh, Soderstrand and Esser as one running from the stone monument at the southwest corner of the Lownsdale claim to a point in the south line of the Couch claim, which is 70 feet west of the west line of Old Fourteenth street, and between plaintiffs and defendants Brigham and Tufts as a line running from the stone monument at the northwest corner of the Chapman claim north SO3 15' east to the iron post set by C. W. Burrage in the south line of the Couch claim.\",\n",
